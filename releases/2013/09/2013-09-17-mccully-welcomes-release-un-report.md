The government says the United Nations investigators report into the use of chemical weapons in Syria is an important step toward holding those responsible to account.

Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says the report confirms the use of chemical weapons in Syria and provides further evidence that the regime was responsible for the attack.

"The Secretary General is correct in labelling this as a despicable act and a gross breach of international law.  Those responsible need to be held accountable,” Mr McCully says.

“The release of this report has reaffirmed the need for the international community to respond to the crisis in Syria. We welcome the framework agreement reached between the United States and Russia for the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons.

“We are also very pleased to see the UN Security Council will now have a role to play in addressing this crisis – something that New Zealand has consistently called for.

“Removing chemical weapons from Syria will clearly be challenging.  We call on all parties involved to move forward in good faith, following a quick and clear timetable.

“The civil war in Syria is a humanitarian tragedy that urgently requires a political solution.  Attention now needs to focus on finding one.”
