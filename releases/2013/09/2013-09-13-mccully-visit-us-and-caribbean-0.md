Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully departs today for a trip to the United States and Caribbean.

Mr McCully, along with Prime Minister John Key, will attend the opening week of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York from September 23.

“UNGA is an excellent opportunity to speak with a range of world leaders about New Zealand’s campaign for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council and issues of global importance, such as the situation in Syria,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully will stop in San Francisco this weekend to support Team New Zealand’s bid for the America’s Cup before travelling on to the Caribbean.

In Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mr McCully will meet his counterparts and other leaders for bilateral meetings and to discuss the Security Council campaign.
