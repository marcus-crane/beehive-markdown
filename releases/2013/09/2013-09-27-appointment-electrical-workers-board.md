Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of Debra Hall to the Electrical Workers Registration Board for a term of two years.

“Ms Hall has extensive governance experience and has a record of success in business and management.  She has undertaken many research projects, with one of the main areas being how markets respond to deregulation.

“I’d like to thank outgoing member Penelope Mudford for her contribution to the board over the past six years,” Mr Williamson says.

There are seven members of the Electrical Workers Registration Board:

- Four persons who are registered or entitled to be registered, of whom at least two must be persons who hold current practising licences under the Electricity Act 1992, and
- Three other persons, of whom at least one must be a person whom the Minister considers has appropriate electrical industry qualifications or experience.

The Board’s statutory functions include registering electrical workers under the Electricity Act 1992, ensuring the competence of registered electrical workers and exercising disciplinary powers.
