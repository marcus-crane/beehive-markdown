Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams leaves tonight for the United States to support New Zealand technology companies and help them expand further into the market.

Ms Adams, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) and the New Zealand Technology Industry Association will host a number of events and meetings for New Zealand technology companies, leveraging off the current international focus on San Francisco.

“The trip is about giving New Zealand companies access to key business people in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and generating business opportunities and potential investment options,” Ms Adams says.

Ms Adams will co-host an event that will give New Zealand technology companies the chance to pitch their ideas to an audience of Silicon Valley investors.

The New Zealand companies include STQRY, TranscribeMe, Polybatics, EROAD, Composite Helicopters International, Lypanosys, Pacific Edge, Green Button and Showcase.

“Many of New Zealand’s high-growth technology companies are looking to the United States, notably Silicon Valley, to grow their businesses, access customers and raise investment capital.

“This event will be a unique opportunity for investors and New Zealand technology firms to build relationships that will allow them to compete – and win – on the global stage.”

Ms Adams will also meet with companies who already have an established presence in the United States, including Xero, GreenButton and Author-IT, to get a better understanding of their successes and challenges in the market.

She will visit the Kiwi Landing Pad, a partnership between the private sector and the New Zealand Government to support selected New Zealand ICT companies to establish and grow their business in the United States.

Ms Adams will also visit Berkeley University to meet with its Business School leaders to discuss its company start-up programme and supporting businesses more generally in the technology industry.

In addition, Ms Adams will visit Washington DC for a number of bilateral meetings covering both the Communications and Information Technology and Environment portfolios.
