The Government has given the green light for a new hospital for the West Coast at an estimated cost of around $60 million says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The greenfield development will replace Grey Base Hospital with new wards, an emergency department and operating theatres,” Mr Ryall says.

“The West Coast DHB serves 32,000 people from Haast to Karamea.

“The plan also includes an integrated family health centre (IFHC) which will co-locate General Practice on the Grey Base site.”

“Design work for the new hospital will start shortly with recommendations made to Government early next year.

“Site work is expected to begin late next year with the new health facility completed by the end of 2016.

“Grey Base Hospital’s facilities have significant seismic issues so this announcement is important for the future of health services on the Coast,” Mr Ryall says.

“The West Coast DHB began reviewing redevelopment options eight years ago, and last year the Government set up a Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group to support and speed up the rebuild. The Partnership Group will continue to oversee the next stage of the new Grey Base Hospital.

“The Government has also given the green light for design work to begin for an integrated family health centre in Westport which the West Coast DHB will seek private sector partners to develop.

“This will provide modern facilities for the people of the Buller district including Karamea and districts,” Mr Ryall says.
