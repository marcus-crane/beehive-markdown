Police Minister Anne Tolley says Labour should check their facts instead of continuing the desperate attacks on Police.

“In the latest example, Labour has tried to score cheap political points by criticising the Police workplace survey, where 24.5 per cent of staff said they are fully engaged - well above the State Sector benchmark,” says Mrs Tolley.

“What their spokesman failed to mention was that under Labour in 2007 only 13 per cent of staff said they were engaged, with 87 per cent either not engaged or actively disengaged.

“It’s clear there have been great improvements under a National-led Government, with crime down in each of the last three years, foot patrols up 70 per cent last year, and technology delivering over half a million additional frontline crime prevention hours each year.

“Police are working smarter and better and have undergone huge operational changes. While a small dip in engagement was expected, it has come at a time when Police are delivering great results.

“This is the second embarrassment for Labour in the space of a few weeks. Recently they highlighted a Police Association survey on the views of frontline staff on resourcing – only to find that the survey actually showed that officers were far happier under this National-led Government than under Labour in 2008.

“This Government backs our Police, and the continued attacks by Labour can’t hide the fact that our officers are doing a fantastic job.”
