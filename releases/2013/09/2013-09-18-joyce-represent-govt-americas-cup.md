Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce leaves for San Francisco tonight to represent the Government in supporting Emirates Team New Zealand in the closing stages of their bid for the America’s Cup.

Mr Joyce follows on from Foreign Affairs and Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully who is travelling on to the Caribbean and New York.

“As well as supporting Team New Zealand out on the water, I will be engaging with Kiwi businesses in San Francisco, including those who have received Government assistance as part of the $3.9 million America’s Cup leveraging programme highlighting our food and wine, technology, clothing and tourism sectors,” Mr Joyce says.

“Since the beginning of July, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has engaged more than 7000 individuals at more than 70 events. These include events at the America’s Cup Park, VIP events at the Waka, on-water hospitality for companies and sectors, and weekly business networking events.

“California is the number one state for visitor arrivals to New Zealand from the United States making up 23 per cent of all arrivals and the leveraging programme makes good business sense to build ties in the US.”
