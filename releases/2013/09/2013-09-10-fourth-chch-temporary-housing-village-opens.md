Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today joined with Prime Minister John Key to officially open the Rangers Park temporary accommodation village in Christchurch’s eastern suburbs.

“These 40 new houses at Rangers Park will help us provide temporary accommodation for families while their earthquake-damaged homes are being repaired. The challenge of finding alternative temporary accommodation at an affordable rent adds stress for families at an already difficult time. This initiative is about reducing the financial stress and minimising the disruption to their lives,” Dr Smith says.

“The Rangers Park development is different to the other three temporary villages in that the houses will be sold off as permanent affordable homes once they are no longer needed as part of the rebuild phase. This alternative approach is more cost effective and will help to increase the supply of affordable housing in Christchurch East.”

Of the 40 houses at Rangers Park, 18 are stand-alone two, three and four bedroom homes and 22 are higher density three-bedroom townhouses. The village is the fourth temporary accommodation village and takes the total number of temporary homes at Kaiapoi, Linwood and Rāwhiti Domain to 124.

“The speed in which this development has opened is a credit to Hawkins Construction, with work only starting in April, and shows the pace and momentum around the rebuild,” Dr Smith says.

“The temporary villages have been very successful with high levels of occupancy since they first opened in August 2011. More than 400 families have been housed to date, with an average stay of 16 weeks. The requests for housing assistance has grown from 100 per month last August to 150 per month this August, reflecting the increased pace of the major home repair work.

“The temporary accommodation villages are just part of the Government’s housing response to Canterbury’s earthquakes. We have established the Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service that has assisted 3,200 families in finding suitable accommodation. We have a major repair programme underway for the Government’s 5,000 damaged state houses and work well advanced for building 700 new state houses. We have also partnered with the private sector in providing specialist workers’ accommodation.”
