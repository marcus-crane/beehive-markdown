Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart for Japan tomorrow before going on to the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Indonesia.

In Tokyo Mr Groser will be speaking at the 4th Japan/New Zealand Partnership Forum, which is being hosted by the New Zealand International Business Forum, and meeting Japanese ministers responsible for trade issues.

“Japan’s entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations presents very significant opportunities for both countries.

“I am looking forward to a dialogue with Japanese business and government leaders on the negotiation and the deeper partnership that lies ahead of us, including in the area of food and agriculture,” Mr Groser says.

During his stay in Japan, Mr Groser will also visit the northern island of Hokkaido for discussions with Japanese agricultural organisations and with dairy farmers who have been applying New Zealand-style pastoral methods.

Mr Groser will then travel on to Bali for the APEC Ministerial meeting on 4 and 5 October, which precedes the annual APEC Leaders meeting. The focus this year will be on progressing the regional trade and investment liberalisation agenda, as set out in the Bogor Goals, and giving renewed impetus to the WTO Doha Round.

In the margins of the APEC meetings Mr Groser will be participating in discussions among Trade Ministers from TPP participating countries to further advance negotiations ahead of an expected meeting of TPP Leaders in Bali. This meeting will be an important milestone as the 12 participating countries work intensively to conclude TPP this year.
