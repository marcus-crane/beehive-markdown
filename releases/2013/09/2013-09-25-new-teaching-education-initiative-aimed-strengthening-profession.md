Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today that the Government is partnering with the Universities of Auckland, Waikato and Otago to provide new postgraduate level initial teacher education (ITE) qualifications from next year.

“The Government is focused on strengthening the teaching profession as a central part of a larger strategy to lift overall education system performance. Improving the quality of ITE provision is an important element of that strategy,” Ms Parata says.

“The Government is taking a phased approach to this work starting with the establishment of a small number of postgraduate level programmes.

“Expectations of education systems are changing and teachers entering the profession need to have the knowledge and expertise to work effectively with an increasingly diverse student population.

“We expect that all students will have the opportunity to develop the knowledge, competencies and values required to be successful in a world that is increasingly complex and uncertain.

“These new programmes will provide the opportunity to demonstrate exemplary practice, to identify the strengths of new approaches and to build the national knowledge base,” Ms Parata said.

“The purpose of enabling tertiary providers to offer postgraduate qualifications for entry to the teaching profession is to improve the expertise of graduating teachers and to strengthen their practice.”

The Minister said further providers may be contracted to start in 2015 through a second tender round.
