Education and Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Hekia Parata, welcomed the opportunity to discuss Pasifika education matters with Samoa Education Minister, Hon Magele Mauiliu Magele.

“New Zealand is a Pacific nation and we have a vested interest in strong relationships in our Pacific neighbourhood, including in the education status of all Pasifika people both here and in the Pacific nations themselves,” says Ms Parata.

The largest Pasifika community in New Zealand are Samoans who make up almost half of the Pasifika population in New Zealand.

Ms Parata provided Minister Magele with copies of the recently released Pasifika Education data in New Zealand, a part of the Public Achievement Information programme.

“The data tells the story of what we already know about our Pasifika students – too many have been left behind in our system but there are very good signs of improvement. Both the system response and parental and aiga engagement is strengthening to the benefit of our Pasifka children and young people.

There are around 60,000 Pasifika children in our New Zealand education system at this time and the Government is ambitious for five out of five achieving.

“We want our Pasifika young people to get the qualifications and skills they need to be successful members of society in the 21st century. This means lifting up those who are being left behind, and encouraging those who are doing well to do even better.

1. In early August, Hon Murray McCully announced the New Zealand funding contribution to several multi-year, multiple-partner initiatives in the education sector in Samoa that are contributing to increased participation in education, strengthened school governance and management, and improved learning outcomes.
2. In addition to contributing to fee-free education at primary and secondary school level and a broad education sector support programme, New Zealand funds scholarships, short-term training awards and an in-country training programme.
3. “We want an outburst of success for all our Pasifika families – and education will certainly play a big part of that – including, strengthening relationships between our two countries,” says Ms Parata.
