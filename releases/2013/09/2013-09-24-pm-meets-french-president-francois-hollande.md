Prime Minister John Key met with French President Francois Hollande at the Elysee Palace in Paris last night (NZ time).

This was Mr Key’s first meeting with President Hollande since he was elected in May 2012.

“The meeting was an opportunity to mark our warm and long standing relationship with France. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, France is a significant European player with huge global reach and we deeply value their friendship,” says Mr Key.

“Our discussions today covered our many areas of cooperation including our trade and economic relationship, and our close cooperation in the Pacific. The President also provided me with some interesting insights into developments in the European Union and the Eurozone.

“We also had a useful discussion on global and regional issues including Syria and Egypt,” says Mr Key.

After the meeting with President Hollande, Mr Key also met with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and hosted representatives from French companies that had invested in New Zealand.

“Beyond these valued connections, there is also scope for French and New Zealand businesses to do more together in third markets such as Asia,” Mr Key says.

“On the eve of the First World War centenary next year, New Zealand and France can demonstrate to a younger generation that our friendship - forged in adversity - is rock solid as we face the future together in a rapidly changing world.”

Mr Key will travel to New York later today to attend the 68th UN General Assembly.
