Latest QS World University Rankings out today underscore the importance of a strategic approach to investment by New Zealand universities in an increasingly competitive global environment, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“The 2013/14 rankings show a continued strong performance with all eight of New Zealand’s universities appearing in the Top 500 in the World for the first time,” Mr Joyce says.

“However, while some of our universities have had their scores improve; their rankings have declined.

“The QS rankings are one of three main world university ranking systems, which all measure different indicators and show different results. Overall the rankings reflect the increased competitiveness of the international university market.

“The Government has increased its investment in universities by 16.5 per cent over the last four years, despite tough financial times. Students have also increased their contribution through some increases in fees. As a result, the annual income of New Zealand universities is nearly $500 million a year higher in 2012 than it was in 2008.

“As a country we are not likely to be able to afford sudden big increases in resources, so the challenge for New Zealand universities from these figures will be to respond more quickly and effectively to the competitive challenges they face. That includes attracting more international students, expanding research links, and investing more in disciplines where they have a competitive advantage.

“The Government will be discussing these matters further in the upcoming draft Tertiary Education Strategy.”
