Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew encouraged all New Zealanders to take action to improve the lives of women as she hosted a celebration of 120 years of women’s suffrage at Parliament.

“On 19 September 120 years ago New Zealand made history. We broke down barriers for women and subsequently helped change world attitudes,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Today we celebrate the suffragists of yesterday who fought and won for women’s rights and we celebrate those men and women who are continuing to create opportunities for women.

"Our Government is committed to making more progress,” she said, describing her vision for New Zealand women.

“I want to see girls continue to excel in education, and to translate that success into employment, earnings and leadership success.

“I want women to be able to enter any occupation, industry or sector that they want to and be able to make the most of their talents and skills.

“I want to be part of a society where we have no tolerance for any violence, particularly against women, and where women have increased safety.

“We all have a part to play in making these things happen. The benefits will be immense, not only for women, but also for their families, our communities and for all New Zealanders.”
