Commerce Minister Craig Foss is congratulating all involved in Money Week 2013 as the event comes to a close.

The theme of Money Week 2013 is ‘Make a date with your money’ and approximately 300 events have taken place around New Zealand to mark the event.

“I am thrilled that so many organisations have taken part from a huge range of sectors. I am also pleased with the breadth of individual and workplace organisations that have embraced ‘Make a date with your money’ message and importance of financial literacy for individuals, staff and community,” says Mr Foss.

Many of New Zealand’s largest workplaces across huge range of sectors have been involved in Money Week 2013, including education, retail, banking, finance, public and private sectors, including Police, Defence, local and national Government, Health, retail and construction.

“I would like to thank the team at the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income for coordinating this year’s event and its on-going work to help New Zealanders better understand their personal finances.

“With Money Week coming to an end for 2013, the challenge now is to keep the momentum going for the other 51 weeks of the year,” says Mr Foss.

Money Week 2013 runs from Sunday 1 September to Saturday 7 September.
