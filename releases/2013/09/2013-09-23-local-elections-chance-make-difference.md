Local Government Minister Chris Tremain says if people expect to hold their councils accountable for decision making they need to be part of that process and vote in the upcoming local government elections.

“Local government provides vital services such as water, wastewater, roading and community services. Council decision making has a visible impact on the day to day lives of people and it’s important that we have elected councillors to represent the views of the community,” says Mr Tremain.

“Casting your vote is important to the democratic process. It’s about getting involved in your community and doesn’t take a lot of effort. The choice to elect council representatives only comes around once every three years and it’s an opportunity that shouldn’t be underestimated.

“If you haven’t completed your voting papers, get onto it today. And if your papers haven’t arrived contact the local electoral officer at your local council. Don’t ignore the chance to have a say in the future of your local community.”

Local elections are conducted by post and voting papers sent out between 20-25 September. They must be returned to councils by midday 12 October.

Preliminary election results will be available on the evening of 12 October. Official election results, including all validated special votes, will be declared between 17 and 23 October.
