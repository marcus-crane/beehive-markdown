Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Christopher Finlayson and Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss have welcomed the most recent addition to Te Ara – New Zealand’s online encyclopedia.

The ‘Daily Life, Sport and Recreation’ section of Te Ara went live on 5 September 2013 and catalogues Kiwi sporting successes and challenges from the beginning of settlement in New Zealand.

The Ministry of Culture and Heritage began work on Te Ara in 2002 and has been steadily adding to the online encyclopedia.

“Te Ara was established to provide comprehensive and accessible information. The site gives New Zealanders an online destination to research historical and cultural events,” says Mr Finlayson.

The Peoples of New Zealand was the first section to be loaded onto the Te Ara website in 2005. Sections on society, the natural environment, Māori, Government, the economy and society, followed.

“Te Ara had 4.8 million visits last year which is a considerable achievement. It is great that Te Ara will be updated to include more information that is important to New Zealanders,” says Mr Foss.

‘The Great Te Ara Sports Debate’ will take place at Te Papa on Saturday 7 September 2013 to celebrate the launch of Te Ara’s sporting section. Notable sports enthusiasts will gather to debate New Zealand’s greatest sporting moment.
