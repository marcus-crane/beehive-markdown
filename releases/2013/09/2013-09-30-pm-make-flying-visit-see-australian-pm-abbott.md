Prime Minister John Key will travel to Canberra on Wednesday 2 October to meet newly-elected Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

“This is our most important relationship. We have forged close bonds with Australia in everything from the battle field to the sporting field, and I expect to enjoy a strong working relationship with Prime Minister Abbott,” says Mr Key.

Australia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner for goods and services, and Australia is both New Zealand’s main source of foreign investment as well as the top destination for New Zealand investment abroad.

“This year we celebrate the 30th anniversary of CER, a model free trade agreement which has brought enormous benefits to both countries.

“New Zealand works closely with Australia across a range of international, trade and security issues and I look forward to discussing with Mr Abbott how we progress our common interest on the world stage,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key will be the first foreign leader to meet with Prime Minister Abbott in Australia.

Mr Key will fly Royal New Zealand Air Force to Canberra on Wednesday afternoon and return to New Zealand that same night.
