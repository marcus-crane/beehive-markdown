A Bill to protect New Zealanders from the most serious sexual or violent offenders passed its first reading in Parliament today.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the Public Safety (Public Protection Orders) Bill will introduce public protection orders (PPOs) – a new order that could detain the most high-risk individuals after they are released from jail.

“These new orders deliver this Government’s commitment to keeping the public protected from the most serious sexual and violent offenders,” Ms Collins says. 

“New Zealanders deserve to feel safe in their homes and communities and these orders aim to protect people from near certain future harm.”

Public Protection Orders will complement existing measures, such as extended supervision orders and preventive detention.

Individuals subject to a PPO will be held in a secure facility until they no longer pose a serious threat to public safety.

Ms Collins says the Bill will apply to the small number of offenders who are extremely likely to seriously offend again if they have the opportunity to do so.

The key features of the PPO regime include:

- It will protect members of the public from individuals who pose a very high risk of imminent and serious sexual or violent offending, and have certain dysfunctional behavioural characteristics.

<!--THE END-->

- People subject to a PPO will live in a residence on prison grounds, separate from the main buildings but within the secure perimeter.

<!--THE END-->

- Offenders subject to a PPO will be re-evaluated regularly, and can seek a court review of their detention at any time. If they no longer meet the criteria, they will be released and placed on a protective supervision order.

<!--THE END-->

- The Bill balances the rights of New Zealanders to be safe in their community with the rights of offenders who have served their sentence.

The new orders are expected to apply to between five to 12 offenders over the next decade.
