The Industry Training and Apprenticeships Amendment Bill, introduced to Parliament today, is a vital part of the Government’s investment in industry training, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“In the 10 years to 2010 Government funding for Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) almost trebled. Unfortunately funding increases were not matched with sufficient accountability for the funding,” Mr Joyce says.

“Under the previous government, up to 100,000 people a year listed as being in industry training were in fact ‘phantom trainees’ who achieved no credits and in some cases were no longer alive.

“The National-led Government has overseen a move to a results focus in industry training – as well as the wider tertiary sector – because it is results that determine the skill levels of the workforce, not intentions.

“In January 2013 the government announced a further package of changes to industry training. The initiatives are about increasing the opportunities for in-work training for New Zealanders by expanding and improving our apprenticeships system.”

The changes include:

- The creation of New Zealand Apprenticeships, replacing Modern Apprentices and other apprenticeship-type training, from 1 January 2014. The new apprenticeships will provide the same level of support, and the same level of subsidy, for all apprentices, regardless of their age.
- Boosting overall funding for apprenticeships. Increased funding for apprenticeships will allow industry training organisations to invest in the quality of education for apprentices, lower fees for employers and encourage growth in the uptake of apprenticeships.
- Boosting the educational content of apprenticeships. At a minimum they will require a programme of at least 120 credits that results in a level four qualification
- The “Apprenticeships re-boot” – the first 10,000 new apprentices enrolled since March have been eligible for a grant of $1,000 towards their tools and off-job costs, or $2,000 if they are in priority trades.

“The changes in the Bill introduced today complement the improvements to industry training that are already underway, and those that will come into effect on 1 January 2014.

The Bill will focus ITOs on two core responsibilities: setting skill-standards for their industries, and arranging training. It also clarifies the functions and powers of NZQA in relation to ITOs, and strengthens the quality assurance framework for ITOs ensuring it is consistent with the framework for other tertiary education organisations.

“The changes in the Bill will boost system performance for employers and trainees, increase the profile and quality of apprenticeships, and build greater links between government, industry training organisations, and the industries they serve,” Mr Joyce says.

As a result of the changes the government is making, and stimulated by the boom in construction and other trades that is already underway in Christchurch, the government estimates that around 14,000 new apprentices will start training over the next five years, over and above the 7,000 who enrol normally.

“Delivering Skilled and Safe Workplaces is a key plank of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to lift productivity, deliver higher wages and living standards, and build a faster-growing and more competitive economy,” Mr Joyce says.
