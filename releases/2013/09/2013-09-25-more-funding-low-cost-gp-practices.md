Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the government will invest an extra $16 million over four years to support general practices offering low-cost doctors’ visits to some of our most vulnerable communities.

“There are nearly 300 general practices across the country that offer low-cost doctors’ visits through the Very Low Cost Access (VLCA) scheme,” says Mr Ryall.

“A review by the Ministry of Health found a number of VLCA practices had very high proportions of low income patients enrolled with them and some faced financial and workforce challenges. This extra funding will be targeted at this group of practices.

“The extra $4 million a year will be allocated to primary health organisations who will work closely with their district health board and the Ministry of Health to distribute the funding to VLCA practices in need of extra support. The funding is targeted at those with greater than 50% high needs populations.

“I have made it very clear that 100 per cent of the money is to go to support general practices – none of this money is to be clipped for administration purposes.

“We are also setting up a $1.5 million scholarship fund for 30 new nurse graduates to work in some VLCA practices across the country for a year.

“Funding for the VLCA scheme has increased by more than 85 per cent in the past six years – from $27 million in 2007/08 to $50 million this financial year.

“Our significant increase in funding has meant nearly 150,000 more New Zealanders are receiving low-cost doctors’ visits compared to 2008.

“Latest data from the Ministry of Health data shows 1.3 million people are enrolled with a GP clinic offering low-cost doctors’ visits – including 75 per cent of Pacific people and 56 per cent of Māori. This means nearly one in three New Zealanders can go to doctors’ with lower fees.

“Under the VLCA scheme visits for children under six years of age are free, visits for children aged 6 to 17 are no more than $11.50 and visits for adults are no more than $17.50.

“Despite continuing tight financial times, this government is committed to growing and protecting our public health services,” says Mr Ryall.
