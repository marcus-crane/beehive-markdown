Changes to the living alone payment coming into effect today will ensure better support for superannuitants and veterans’ pensioners who live alone.

When a superannuitant or veterans’ pensioner suffers the loss of a spouse or partner and now lives alone, they are entitled to the living alone payment to help with the costs of running their household.

“We know it’s tougher living alone when you can no longer share basic household costs like groceries or the power bill,” Social Development Minister Paula Bennett said.

“The changes we have made introduce a much simpler process for those entitled to receive the payment, and we are also removing unnecessary administrative burdens at what is a difficult and stressful time.”

New Zealand Superannuation and Veterans’ Pension will now have a new single living alone rate and a single sharing accommodation rate.

From today, single superannuitants and veterans’ pensioners who live alone will no longer need to make a new application to receive their full entitlement.

Instead of having to visit a Work and Income office to fill out an application form, clients can now complete the process over the phone, by email or in person.

Superannuitants and veterans’ pensioners who currently receive the Living Alone Payment do not have to do anything, and the rate of payment remains the same.
