The Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income has launched Money Week 2013 following the success of its inaugural event last year.

“Money Week 2013 is shaping up to be a fantastic seven days, with more than 250 events registered across the country. I’m thrilled to see more than 150 schools are also involved,” says Mr Foss.

The theme of Money Week 2013 is “Make a Date With Your Money” and runs between Sunday 1 September and Sunday 8 September.

“It is important that we all take an active interest in our personal finances. The better we are informed, the better financial decisions we will make.

“I would like to thank the team at the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income for planning this event and I would also like to thank community organisations, workplaces, banks and financial organisations for getting involved and helping Kiwis learn to better manage their money,” says Mr Foss.
