Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today presented the country’s most prestigious conservation award, the Loder Cup, to Christchurch botanist Nicholas Head.

“Nick Head is a very deserving winner of the country’s oldest conservation award. He has been a tireless advocate for Canterbury’s unique plant life, both through his professional work with the Department of Conservation and as a volunteer and advocate for numerous trusts and organisations,” Dr Smith says.

“His contribution has included extensive work in plant identification, guided field trips, public talks and advocacy for conservation before councils and the Environment Court. A particular benefactor of his work has been the unique plant life of the limestone areas of South Canterbury and the spectacular Mackenzie Basin.”

Mr Head was nominated by the Canterbury Aoraki Conservation Board, with supporting letters from Forest and Bird, Environment Canterbury, DOC, Landcare Research, and the QEII National Trust.

The Loder Cup was donated by Gerald Loder in 1926 to encourage and honour New Zealanders who work to investigate, promote, retain, and cherish New Zealand’s indigenous flora.
