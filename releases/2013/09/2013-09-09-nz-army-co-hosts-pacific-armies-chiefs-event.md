Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the NZ Army is co-hosting a major gathering of top Army personnel from 29 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

“For the first time in over 20 years, the NZ Army is co-hosting a major event on the Pacific Armies calendar,” says Dr Coleman. “The NZ Army has a good working relationship with the US Army, and it is great that New Zealand was asked to co-host this event with the US.”

The Pacific Armies Chiefs’ Conference and the Pacific Armies’ Management Seminar takes place in Auckland from 9-13 September 2013. It brings together military leaders from across the Asia-Pacific region to promote stability through mutual understanding and strengthening ties.

The theme of this year’s conference is how the United Nations and the Pacific Armies can improve co-operation on future peacekeeping missions. For the first time, a number of key UN representatives are participating in this forum.

“New Zealand has a proud history contributing to a range of UN peacekeeping missions alongside our international partners since the 1950s. We remain committed to playing our part in collective international security.

“Following a decade of operations in Afghanistan, Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands, the Government is reviewing how New Zealand should contribute to UN peacekeeping operations in the future. It is timely that these issues are being discussed at this week’s conference,” says Dr Coleman.

Over 230 personnel are attending the biennial Pacific Armies Chiefs’ Conference and the annual Pacific Armies’ Management Seminar. Key speakers include Ameerah Haq, UN Under Secretary General for Field Support, General Nyamvumba, former Force Commander of the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur, and Major General Obi, former Force Commander of the UN Mission in Sudan which transitioned to South Sudan.
