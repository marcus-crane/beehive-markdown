Primary Industries Nathan Guy has announced Sir Maarten Wevers as the sixth and newest member of the Primary Growth Partnership’s Investment Advisory Panel (IAP).

“This appointment reflects the growing profile and importance of the Primary Growth Partnership,” Mr Guy says.

Members of the IAP are responsible for providing advice on the investment decisions of PGP funds, and to help ensure that PGP investments achieve the aims of economic growth.

“Sir Maarten brings a wealth of experience to this role, having held a number of senior public sector and commercial roles spanning 35 years.

“This includes time as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and Ambassador to Japan. Sir Maarten also served in the New Zealand Embassy in Brussels, focussing on trade and economic policy.

“Most recently Sir Maarten was Chief Executive for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from 2004 to 2012. In 2012 he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.”

The announcement was made at the PGP AGM held today in Wellington.

The Primary Growth Partnership is made up of 16 projects with $684 million in funding committed from both industry and Government. The projects aim to boost productivity and innovation across the primary industries, including the fishing, forestry, red meat, honey and dairy sectors.

“The potential benefit to the wider economy from these programmes is estimated at around $7 billion per year from 2025. It will play a major part in achieving the Government’s goal of doubling primary sector exports by 2025,” says Mr Guy.
