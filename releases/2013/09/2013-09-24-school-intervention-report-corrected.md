Education Minister Hekia Parata has today corrected the report that said the ‘Government could step in and take over schools if students marks aren’t good enough.’

“School interventions happen for a number of reasons related to educational performance. Previously, they have been due to safety, HR or financial issues, which are easier to recognise as there have always been measures in place to determine if there is a problem,” Ms Parata says.

“Let me be quite clear – it is a very serious step to decide to remove a Board let alone move to closure. All these decisions are weighed very carefully and are never based on one factor alone.

“Now that we have a better data and information basis for understanding learning and achievement, we are together with ERO reports able to make an earlier assessment as to which schools require support and more precisely, what kind.

“Our focus is on supporting leadership teams and teachers to understand what they can do with their own National Standards data and what tools are available to support them to become successful and direct their resources more effectively for the benefit of their students.”
