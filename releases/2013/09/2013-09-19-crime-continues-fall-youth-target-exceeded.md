Justice Minister Judith Collins has today announced the Government’s new youth crime target – to reduce youth offending by 25 per cent by 2017.

Ms Collins says the earlier, interim five per cent target has been exceeded. From June 2011 to June 2013 youth crime dropped 19 per cent.

“Huge effort has gone into targeting youth offending and keeping young people from going before the courts, and it’s paying off,” Ms Collins says. 

“We know the earlier young people begin offending, the greater the odds they will re-offend. This Government is committed to steering people away from a life of crime and setting a new and more ambitious youth target is part of this.”

Key initiatives targeting youth crime include the Justice sector’s Better Public Services (BPS) result action plan focusing on vulnerable youth and youth offenders including:

- Improving health and education responses for at-risk youth
- Improving responses to children as, or before, they come to the notice of the criminal justice system
- Developing integrated school attendance services to respond to disengaged and truanting youth
- Improving youth mental health pathways and services

The other Justice sector BPS targets are a 15 per cent reduction in overall crime, a 20 per cent reduction in violent crime and a 25 per cent reduction in re-offending by June 2017.

Latest results to June 2013 show the total crime rate is down 12 per cent, the violent crime rate is down 8 per cent and the re-offending rate is down 11 per cent. 

“The Justice sector is well on track to meet its BPS targets by 2017. But we’re not about to rest on our laurels,” Ms Collins says.

“I thank the Ministry of Justice, Police and Corrections and my Justice sector ministerial colleagues for their continued and unrelenting focus on reducing crime and making New Zealand safer.”
