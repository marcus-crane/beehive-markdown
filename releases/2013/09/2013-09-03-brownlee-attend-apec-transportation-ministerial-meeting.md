Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee will be travelling to Tokyo, Japan to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 8th Transportation Ministerial Meeting from 4 to 6 September.

The meeting is an opportunity for Ministers of the 21 APEC member countries to discuss various topics regarding transportation in the Asia-Pacific Region. The theme this year is “Aiming for a transportation system which helps to accelerate growth and prosperity within the Pacific Rim.” The topics being discussed include promoting connectivity in the APEC region, enhancing transportation infrastructure, and pursuing quality transport.

“Attending the APEC meeting is a prime opportunity to learn from, and share our own experiences with, other APEC nations as New Zealand strives to achieve an efficient, effective, safe and resilient transport network,” Mr Brownlee says.

During APEC, Mr Brownlee will be meeting with Transport Ministers from Chile, Japan, Singapore and South Korea to discuss shared transport issues.

At the conclusion of the meeting, a Ministerial Statement will be issued which will shape the work programme of the APEC Transportation Working Group for the next two years.

While in Japan, Mr Brownlee will take the opportunity to tour Japan’s Nissan Leaf Factory to observe and test drive the latest in electric vehicle technology. He will also meet with Japan’s Vice Minister for Reconstruction, and industry representatives to discuss earthquake recovery issues.
