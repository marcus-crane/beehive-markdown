Consumer Affairs Minister Craig Foss will host the 2013 Consumer Credit and Financial Literacy Forum in Auckland next month.

“The event will bring together lenders, budgeting services, financial literacy providers, dispute resolution organisations, industry representatives, government and community organisations,” says Mr Foss.

The theme for this year’s forum is *Responsible Lenders, Informed Borrowers*.

“Financial literacy is key to ensuring borrowers are informed and make the best decisions for their individual situation. Responsible lending is equally as important.

“The Credit Contracts and Financial Services Law Reform Bill which targets loan sharks will strengthen protections for borrowers and make wide-ranging changes to consumer credit and repossession laws. The Consumer Law Reform Bill is also being progressed. It will promote confident, well informed consumers,” says Mr Foss.

The Forum will cover a range of topics from budget advocacy, consumer rights, dispute resolution and responsible lending.

The Retirement Commissioner Diane Maxwell will Chair the event in Otara next month.

“It is an important opportunity to hear perspectives on consumer credit and financial literacy awareness and share day-to-day experiences on the ground dealing with consumer and financial literacy challenges,” says Mr Foss.
