The Government is making a $536,000 contribution to recovery costs from serious flooding on the West Coast in December 2010, Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye said today.

“Over a 48 hour period from 27 December 2010 heavy and persistent rain fell on the West Coast affecting areas from Haast to Karamea. This caused flooding, slips and debris fall, as well as considerable land and property damage and loss of livestock in the region,” Ms Kaye says.

“I am pleased to announce this reimbursement for recovery costs to the West Coast Regional Council. This decision follows on from flood recovery reimbursements provided to Tasman District Council and Marlborough District Council in 2011.

“I understand with a small council the importance of the Government contributing to an event like this. It would be difficult for rate payers to bear this cost.

“The bulk of the expenditure incurred by the West Coast Regional Council was for the rebuilding of stop banks and rock walls which were severely damaged during peak river flows.  It has taken considerable time and effort to restore the region’s river management systems to pre-flood levels.

“The Government welcomes the opportunity to provide this recovery funding.  We believe that providing some support to the community for their recovery efforts is important.

“The West Coast Regional Council has done a great job on restoration and recovery since the flooding events of December 2010.”
