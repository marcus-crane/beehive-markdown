Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed Auckland Council’s unanimous support for the Auckland Housing Accord to urgently increase the supply and affordability of housing in Auckland.

“Today’s adoption of the Accord and notification of the draft Unitary Plan by Auckland Council maintains the momentum for our housing supply reforms,” Dr Smith says.

“Last Thursday the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act was passed and comes into effect next Monday. The next step will be to identify the first batch of Special Housing Areas that will contribute to the 39,000 extra homes provided for under the Accord over the next three years. My ambition is to provide sufficient Special Housing Areas by Christmas to accommodate an additional 5,000 homes.”

The Accord will see low-rise greenfield developments of more than 50 dwellings within Special Housing Areas consented within six months as compared to the current average of three years; and three months for brownfield developments as compared to the current average of one year.

“The Accord will ramp up Auckland’s new build rate from the average of 3,600 a year to 9,000 homes next year, 13,000 in 2015, and 17,000 in 2016,” Dr Smith says.

“It’s up to Auckland where it wants to grow. What this Accord does is support them to get some momentum around building the least contentious 39,000 of the 400,000 homes identified in the draft Unitary Plan that Auckland needs to keep up with population growth over the next 30 years.

“The Accord will remain in place for three years and is an interim measure until Auckland’s Unitary Plan becomes fully operative. This Accord and new law are just part of the Government’s housing reform programme. The Government is taking action on reforming the Resource Management Act, reigning in council development charges, scrutinising building material costs, reducing compliance costs, improving productivity in the building and construction sector, and expanding the Welcome Home Loan and KiwiSaver First Home Deposit Subsidy to support first home buyers.

“I commend the Mayor and Council on the work that has gone in to the Accord and Unitary Plan.  The steps taken today are essential if we are to make progress on increasing housing supply and to cool the overheated Auckland housing market.”
