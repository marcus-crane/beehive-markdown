Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the formal acceptance by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) of the NZ Transport Agency's application and supporting documents to construct the Pūhoi to Warkworth section of the Ara Tūhono – Pūhoi to Wellsford Road of National Significance.

The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) has now published its application and the supporting documents online at [www.nzta.govt.nz/puhoi-to-warkworth-application](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/puhoi-to-warkworth-application)

The four-laned 18.5 kilometre Pūhoi to Warkworth section of the road starts at the Johnstones Hill tunnels at the north end of the Northern Gateway Toll Road on State Highway 1. 

Mr Brownlee says that while the public submission process will not be likely to get underway until later this year, he’s encouraging people to review the application documents online.

“The NZ Transport Agency has made this information available now in an effort to keep the community fully informed as this project progresses,” Mr Brownlee says.

The government announced the Puhoi to Wellsford section of State Highway 1 as a Road of National Significance in March 2009.  Mr Brownlee says the new road will bring significant benefits to the Northland and Rodney districts, as well as to Auckland.

“The Puhoi to Wellsford corridor has been identified as one of our most essential state highway routes to reduce congestion, improve safety and support economic growth in the Auckland and Northland regions.”

Mr Brownlee says that following the EPA’s acceptance of the NZ Transport Agency’s application, the Ministers for the Environment and Conservation will next decide on the appropriate consenting process to consider the application.
