Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today opened the 2013 New Zealand Education Fair in Seoul as part of his four-day visit to Korea to boost education ties between the two countries.

More than 30 New Zealand institutions from all areas of the education sector are represented at the two-day education fair being held at Seoul’s COEX Convention and Exhibition Centre.

“The education fair is an opportunity for our education providers to meet and talk directly with prospective students and their parents about the many high-quality education options available in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“Face-to-face interaction at the fair give students and families a real sense of New Zealand and the high-quality and world-class international education we offer.

“International education contributes $2.5 billion to our economy annually and supports approximately 32,000 jobs. Korea is New Zealand’s third largest source of international students and the fair will assist in further expanding this market, as we target doubling the value of international education to $5 billion by 2025.”

Mr Joyce is on a four-day visit to Korea to boost education ties between the two countries – raising awareness of New Zealand as a study destination and also as a potential provider of English language and school programmes in Korea.

Mr Joyce’s Korean visit also included meetings with education leaders and senior Korean government officials, attending an education agent networking event and a New Zealand-educated alumni reception, and supporting Christchurch as an education destination.
