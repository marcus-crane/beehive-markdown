Labour is not playing straight on safety in the Defence Force, says Defence Minister, Jonathan Coleman.

“The fact is Labour did nothing to address safety issues in Defence during its time in office.

“Sadly there were 8 accidental deaths in Defence over the past 5 years, and 8 deaths in the 5 years prior to that period. One death is one too many.

“I chose to instigate this review because I felt strongly that the culture of health and safety in defence needed further investigation. The Government is fully committed to implementing the recommendations.

“The CDF’s retirement is completely unrelated to this review.

“Unfortunately Phil Goff is seeking to make political gain on an issue which should be a bipartisan one. All the more unfortunate seeing as Mr Goff never addressed the issue during his time as Minister.”
