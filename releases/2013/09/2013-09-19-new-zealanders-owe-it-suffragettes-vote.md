Justice Minister Judith Collins welcomes the Electoral Commission’s plans to mark the 120th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote in New Zealand.

“On this day in September 1893, New Zealand became the first country in the world where women won the right to vote,” Ms Collins says.

“Today we encourage eligible voters to use the very rights the suffragettes fought for.”

To celebrate this important milestone, and what the suffragettes achieved, the Electoral Commission will oversee an education programme focussed on voter participation.

The programme includes three initiatives - a poster competition, an academic scholarship and a new classroom resource to help Year 7 and 8 students understand the campaign for universal suffrage and encourage democratic engagement today.

“I congratulate the Electoral Commission for developing this programme which is a wonderful way to commemorate the hard work of our suffragettes,” Ms Collins says.
