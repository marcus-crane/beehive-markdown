Education Minister Hekia Parata today met with Phil Harding, President of the New Zealand Principals’ Federation (NZPF) to discuss action to strengthen confidence in New Zealand’s high trust model of education.

The Minister initiated the meeting following public comments made by Mr Harding that he believed there were examples of unprofessional assessment and teaching practice in some schools that might affect the reliability of schools’ National Standards data.

“I invited Mr Harding to meet with me today to discuss this further” says Ms Parata.

“Mr Harding was unequivocal that NZPF does not endorse unprofessional conduct in any shape or form, and will continue to actively promote to colleagues the importance of acting ethically and professionally at all times, and in all aspects of their work, including the forming and reporting of Overall Teacher Judgements,” says Ms Parata.

“It is clear that this early in the implementation of National Standards we have work to do on both dependability of overall teacher judgements, and improved reporting to parents. This is the same process of improvement we saw with the introduction of NCEA before we reached the high standard we now have.

“I would be very concerned if our school professionals were not seeking assistance to improve their practice. While it is still early days in implementing this system, it is important that good practice becomes common practice”.

“I have asked the Secretary of Education to work with sector leaders to further support school principals as the guardians of quality teaching and assessment in their schools” says Ms Parata.
