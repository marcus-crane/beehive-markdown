Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has reauthorised the trans-Tasman alliance between Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia, ensuring that passengers continue to benefit from the arrangements that have been in place since 2010.

Mr Brownlee says that under the alliance, the number of passengers travelling across the Tasman has continued to grow, and low fares have been maintained.

In making his decision, Mr Brownlee noted that reauthorisation of the alliance would provide a strong competitive balance with the Qantas Group, which now has a similar alliance in place with Emirates.

Mr Brownlee has authorised the alliance until 31 October 2018, to coincide with the expiry of the agreements in Australia.

“In 2018, both trans-Tasman alliances will expire. In order to remain in effect beyond 2018, both alliances will be required to demonstrate that further reauthorisation will continue to be in the best interests of trans-Tasman passengers.”

Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia will also be required to comply with conditions imposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which has also reauthorised the alliance. These conditions require the airlines to operate a minimum number of seats on a number of trans-Tasman routes.

Mr Brownlee sees no reason for similar conditions in New Zealand. “I am satisfied that the conditions imposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission are sufficient to ensure that the airlines continue to operate in a competitive manner.”

However, as a condition of authorisation, the airlines have agreed to provide detailed operational data to the Ministry of Transport every six months. This will enable the alliance to be closely monitored. The Minister of Transport has the ability to revoke authorisation, should the airlines fail to comply with the terms of the alliance agreement.

A copy of the report to the Minister and the alliance agreement are available on the Ministry of Transport website [www.transport.govt.nz](http://www.transport.govt.nz).
