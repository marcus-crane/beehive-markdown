The Minister of Education Hekia Parata has confirmed that resources will be available to support one principal in each of the greater Christchurch learning clusters, to spend up to a day a week working across the schools and early childhood services in the cluster to further develop and implement their learning plans.

Around 35 clusters of schools and early childhood services have been working together over the last ten months, to progress community level collaborative activity, as part of the greater Christchurch education renewal programme.

“I want to thank all the schools and early childhood services in these learning clusters for the progress they have made to date, which has been very encouraging. We are backing these schools to work together to make a real difference to learning for the children, young people and their families in their local communities.

“The boost I have announced today will enhance the clusters ability to realise their vision and further support schools working together in the interests of student achievement in Christchurch.

“When schools and early childhood services work for the good of all the community’s children and young people, rather than just the students in their own school, a more powerful impact on learning occurs. We are seeing the beginnings of this already in Christchurch, and this initiative will provide a further boost to their efforts.

“Again the people of Christchurch are showing that in working together they are a model for the rest of New Zealand,” Ms Parata said.
