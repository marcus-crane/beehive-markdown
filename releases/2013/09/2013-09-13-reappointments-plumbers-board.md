Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced two reappointments to the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board.

Peter Jackson and William Irvine have been reappointed for three year terms.

“Mr Jackson, who is registered as a certifying plumber, gasfitter and drainlayer, is the current deputy chair of the Board and its appointed representative to the World Plumbing Council.

“Mr Irvine is registered as a certifying drainlayer and currently works as an educator and consultant. He is the former Technical Advisor of the Building Research Association of New Zealand.

“The contribution of both men has been invaluable to the Board, and it will continue to benefit through their continued efforts,” Mr Williamson says.

The Board is a statutory body established under the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006. The Board is responsible for administering the registration and licensing systems of plumbers, gasfitters and drainlayers and in doing so, is responsible for setting the minimum standards for registration and ensuring persons carrying out regulated work are competent to do so
