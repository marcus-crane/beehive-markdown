Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says Customs’ online duty and GST calculator is helping highlight the additional costs associated with online shopping, which many people are not aware of.

On average, 4,000 people a week are using the calculator on the *What’s My Duty?* website, and more than 2,100 people have downloaded the mobile app.

“I’m pleased the duty calculator is helping Kiwis make informed purchasing decisions.  Many people aren’t aware that when they buy goods from overseas on the internet that they are actually importing, and as such can be liable for import duty, GST, and an import entry transaction fee.

“The calculator helps buyers see the true cost of the goods they want to buy. It can calculate single or multiple purchases, in many currencies, and gives a breakdown of the estimated duty and charges buyers may be up for when the goods arrive in New Zealand,” Mr Williamson says.

All goods imported into New Zealand, whether commercially or for personal use, are potentially liable for import duty, GST, and an import entry transaction fee.

Not all items have import duty but many commonly imported items such as clothing and footwear (10 per cent) and some toys (five per cent) do.
