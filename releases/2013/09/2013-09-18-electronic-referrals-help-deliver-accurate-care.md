More and more general practitioners (GPs) are using the latest technology to refer patients for care instead of relying on paper-based methods of health administration.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says electronic referrals, or eReferrals, are transforming the way clinicians and other front line health professionals are managing patient care through the public health service.

“The days of a GP sending off a written referral to a hospital specialist and hoping it reaches the right person are going,” says Mr Ryall.

“Increasingly patients are being referred for treatment at the touch of a button, with GPs, hospital staff and other health providers able to complete online referral forms and then send them electronically.

“The number of eReferrals being sent around New Zealand is increasing, with more than 40,000 being sent each month.

“The pre-formatted referral forms are designed to provide all of the information clinicians need, such as their patient’s unique National Health Index number, test results, and list of medicines. An eReferral is less likely to be returned to the sender because of gaps in the information provided.

“There is also less chance of an electronic referral being unreadable. You don’t have to decipher someone else’s handwriting. Important patient information can be communicated quickly and accurately, often while the patient is still in the doctor’s room.

“By reducing the number of referrals that are incomplete, unreadable, or on occasion get lost, patients can get through the health system faster and clinicians receive better quality information on which to base their decisions.

“The feedback we’re getting is that GPs and others are finding the new system simple and intuitive to use, and reducing the amount of time spent on each referral,” says Mr Ryall.

Not only can eReferrals be sent and accessed by authorised health professionals securely and quickly, they can also be monitored and will provide more transparency about the way DHBs prioritise patients.

Sixteen district health boards (DHBs) are now using eReferrals and the rest are introducing them. By 2014 all DHBs should have a regional eReferrals system in place.
