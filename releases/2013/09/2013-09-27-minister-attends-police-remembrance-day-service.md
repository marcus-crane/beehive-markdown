Police Minister Anne Tolley has paid tribute to the Police officers who have died in the course of their duties, and to serving and former Police staff who have died in the past year, during a service at the Police College in Porirua.

The Police Remembrance Day event was attended by over 500 current and retired Police staff, families and members of the public.

“This is a very important day for the Police and our Police families,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It is a very emotional day which rekindles very powerful memories, and also serves as a reminder that the men and women in our Police service are constantly putting their lives on the line to keep communities safe.

“Our Police staff receive excellent training and are better resourced than ever before to deal with difficult situations.

“However the danger and unpredictability of the job can never be completely removed.

“I also want to recognise the bravery and support of our Police families, who make sacrifices so that our officers can serve the public.

“As we look to the future, with a highly successful Police service which has the trust and confidence of the public, we must always keep in mind the contribution of past and present officers.”
