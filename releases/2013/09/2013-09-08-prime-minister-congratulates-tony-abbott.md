Prime Minister John Key has today congratulated Tony Abbott on his victory in the Australian election.

“I passed on my congratulations to Tony Abbott last night, and will relay my congratulations in person when I speak to him today,” says Mr Key.

“I look forward to working with Australia’s new Prime Minister to build on the close unique relationship that exists between New Zealand and Australia.

“We will have several opportunities to meet over the next few months to discuss how our two countries can continue to work together.

“Australia is our most important relationship. Our common interests span trade, economic, defence and security matters and we cooperate closely in our region and on the international stage.

“In the term of this new Australian Government, New Zealand and Australia will commemorate the centenary of the First World War and the Gallipoli landings, where the ANZAC spirit was forged. We will also jointly host the Cricket World Cup in 2015.

“These events remind us of the many bonds between our two countries, whether historical, cultural or on the sporting field, and of the importance of preserving and extending our relationship,” says Mr Key.

“I would like to put on the record my thanks to Kevin Rudd and his predecessor Julia Gillard, whom I have enjoyed working with over the past few years. They have both been instrumental in ensuring the relationship between our two countries continues to grow from strength to strength. I look forward to this continuing during Tony Abbott's Prime Ministership.”
