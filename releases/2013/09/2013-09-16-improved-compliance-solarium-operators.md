Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the second survey of solarium operators by the Ministry of Health which indicates improvement in compliance with the sector’s voluntary standard.

“The first survey was in the second half of 2012, and showed a substantial reduction in the number of operators,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The latest survey shows that those choosing to remain in operation seem to be improving their practices.

“For example, 76 per cent of operators reported that they performed skin assessments before clients could use a sunbed, compared to 38 per cent in the previous survey.

“This suggests that the work of public health units to raise awareness and improve best practice is paying dividends.”

“While a large majority of operators appear to understand the risks and welcome the Ministry visits, it concerns me that some refused to take part and others do not appreciate the risks of exposure to UV radiation from sunbeds.

“Consumer NZ will be repeating its mystery tanner survey during the next few months which will show whether operators are actually doing what they say.

“Amendments to the Health Act 1956 later this year will prohibit access to commercial sunbeds for people under 18 years of age,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“This is one of five key ways the Government is acting to help prevent New Zealanders getting skin cancer, and to provide faster treatment for melanoma.

“We’re also investing in promoting sun safety education and awareness, improving resources and training for health professionals, developing a national melanoma tumour standard as part of our faster cancer treatment initiatives, and providing increased access to skin lesion removal including supporting GPs to remove more non-complex skin lesions.”
