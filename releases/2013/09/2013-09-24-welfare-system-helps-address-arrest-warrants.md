Outstanding arrest warrants are being cleared through a policy to sanction beneficiaries who are on the run from Police.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says this imaginative policy has already seen 161 arrest warrants cleared within six weeks of operation.

“Arrest warrants don’t just go away by themselves; they have to be dealt with and by prompting action through the benefit system, that’s happening faster.”

The new rule affects those with an outstanding criminal arrest warrant for 28 days or longer. They get another ten days to clear it, but if they don’t, their benefit is stopped.

The exception to this is for parents who, as with all sanctions, never lose more than half their benefit.

“People just have to do the right thing and face up to warrants and they’ll only be sanctioned if they continue to ignore multiple warnings.”

So far 95 people have been sanctioned.

“The Police Commissioner can request an immediate benefit suspension for seriously high-risk offenders, which has happened in nine cases so far.”

“Taxpayers do not agree they should pay for dangerous criminals to be on the run from Police, so this Government got creative and did something about it.”

There are around 15,000 with outstanding arrest warrants at any one time, and 8,000 of those receive a benefit.

More people coming forward to clear warrants helps free up Police time and resources and officers can focus on other important police work.
