Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says a change to the way education property is disposed of will free up money to reinvest in new school property faster.

“In the past two years $26.3 million has been netted from the sale of surplus property,” Ms Kaye says. “This change means we’ll be able to reinvest that money faster in other school property priorities such as modern learning environments and upgrading essential infrastructure.”

The Ministry of Education will now work with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) to manage disposal of property no longer required for education purposes. There is a provisional agreement that responsibility will move to LINZ for management and disposal of these properties.

“LINZ expects to cut disposal times by six to 12 months, as it’s the agency with the greatest understanding of moving properties through the complex processes required by the Public Works Act,” Ms Kaye says.

“So where there’s a former school or school housing that is no longer required this will improve and speed up the disposal process.

“I have been worried about the potential risk when properties are left vacant for long periods of time, including security issues and vandalism.

“Communities don’t want buildings vacant for long periods of time. They want good quality public facilities that are used as much as possible,” Ms Kaye says.

Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says any disposal of Crown-owned land must meet a number of statutory and government policy requirements, such as the Public Works Act 1981.

“This ensures the interests or rights that parties, including other government agencies, former owners and iwi, may have in the land are appropriately addressed.  Today’s announcement means Education properties that are no longer required will progress through this process faster across the country,” Mr Williamson says.

The Crown Land Centre of Expertise operated by LINZ aligns with the Government’s overarching goal of creating a better public service, and contributes to economic development by enabling Crown agencies to manage and utilise their assets more effectively.
