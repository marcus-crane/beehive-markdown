Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today congratulated Customs following the nine year prison sentence handed down to a Hong Kong man caught importing a record haul of methamphetamine, or ‘P’.

“The sentencing of 31-year old Wai Hung Mak at Auckland District Court today sends a clear message that anyone coming to New Zealand solely for the purpose of bringing in drugs will not get away with it.”

In December 2012 Customs intercepted a package at the International Mail Centre containing 980 grams of methamphetamine, which had a street value of nearly $1 million.  The drug was hidden inside heat sealed tea packets.

A controlled delivery operation was staged two days later and this ultimately led to the arrest of Mak, who had been in the country for just two weeks.

“It was clear this man came into New Zealand for the sole purpose of importing drugs.  I applaud Customs for stopping him and keeping almost $1 million of this vile and damaging drug from reaching our communities. 

“If people attempt to bring in methamphetamine or any other drugs, we will catch them and we will throw them in jail,” Maurice Williamson says.

The Government has focussed on attacking the supply, manufacture and consumption of methamphetamine because of its prevalence in the illicit drug market.
