Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today celebrated the start of two significant new commercial developments in Christchurch’s CBD, and unveiled imagery of the next stage of the Avon River Precinct, The Terraces.

He will then cap off the day by attending the official re-opening of the Heritage Hotel in Cathedral Square.

First stop was partaking in the official sod turning of prominent property owner Antony Gough’s $140 million retail and entertainment development, The Terrace.

“I want to thank Antony Gough for becoming the new CBD’s greatest champion,” Mr Brownlee says.

“He was one of the first to understand the vision of the CBD blueprint, and his optimism and pragmatism have been a fine example of how to bounce back following a natural disaster.”

Mr Brownlee accepted Mr Gough’s invitation to be part of a novel sod-turning ceremony, with both men taking to the cockpit of large diggers for the ceremonial works.

Mr Brownlee says Mr Gough’s development exemplifies the vision of connecting the Avon River to the CBD, right down to the name of his project and its adjoining section of the Avon River Precinct.

It is the first private development to start construction in the city’s Retail Precinct, which Mr Brownlee says will kick start a new level of economic activity in the CBD. Nine Outline Development Plans (ODPs) have been consented in the Retail Precinct with further works planned to get underway early next year.

Naming of the Avon River Precinct’s next section recognises the terracing that will flow down to the water and enhance the area between the Bridge of Remembrance and Victoria Square. It will include space for entertainment and public gatherings adjacent to the private commercial developments in the area.

“The redevelopment of the Avon River is one of my favourite changes to the city, so I’m very glad to be able to outline these next steps,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Government has allocated around $100 million for the Avon River Precinct, including the already-completed Watermark stage. Above ground work on The Terraces will get underway in February next year, following repairs starting next month to damaged underground wastewater pipes.

Mr Brownlee also today congratulated the Yeo family on the commencement of their Awly Investments office and retail development, which began today on the old site of the Amuri Courts on Durham Street.

This five-storey multi-use complex will house three separate blocks of retail and office space, and will be completed by mid-2015.

“It is the courage of Christchurch stalwarts like the Yeos and the Goughs that is instilling such confidence in Christchurch’s future,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Government is investing billions of dollars to rebuild and enhance our central city, but it is the support of these residents that gives real life to the recovery.”

Later today the Minister will attend the official re-opening by His Excellency the Governor General Lieutenant General Sir Jerry Mateparae of the Heritage Hotel in Cathedral Square.

“This is one of the city’s iconic buildings and it has required a fair bit of attention in order to be reopened.

“The Heritage has done a fantastic job and I am very glad to see their doors back open and the guests arriving,” Mr Brownlee says.
