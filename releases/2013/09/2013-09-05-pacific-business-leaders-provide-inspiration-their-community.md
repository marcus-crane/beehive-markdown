Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata says the Pacific business community is playing a key role in New Zealand’s economic future by inspiring and mentoring the next generation of Pacific business leaders.

“By 2026 one in eight people between the ages of 15-39 in New Zealand will be of Pacific descent. Because of this young and fast growing demographic, Pacific people have the opportunity to help shape and influence New Zealand’s economic future,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Parata is addressing attendees at the Pacific Leaders Dinner, a Pacific Business Trust event in Auckland tonight to celebrate Pacific business success and recognise the achievements of New Zealand Superannuation Fund CEO Adrian Orr.

“Congratulations to Adrian Orr for receiving the Navigator Award tonight. He has been recognised on the world stage for his work on the New Zealand Super Fund and it is fitting that he is now recognised in New Zealand as one of our leading Pacific business people.

“Like many leading Pacific business people, Adrian provides a great example and inspiration to aspiring Pacific business people – indeed to all New Zealanders – and this is something we will celebrate tonight.

“Looking to the future, it was pleasing to see a record 40 Pacific teams take part in this years’ Young Enterprise Scheme. Impressively, most teams had a business mentor attached to their team who gave their knowledge, expertise and mentorship to support to the next generation of Pacific business leaders.

“If we can get more Pacific people to follow the example set by our business leaders then the future for Pacific people, as well as New Zealand’s economic future, will be bright,” says Ms Parata.

The Pacific Business Trust, funded through the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, offers training, support and business development services to help Pacific entrepreneurs and business people succeed.
