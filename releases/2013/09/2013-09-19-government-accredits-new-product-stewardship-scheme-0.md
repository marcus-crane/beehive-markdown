Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced the accreditation of a product stewardship scheme which turns nappies and sanitary waste into compost.

Using purpose-built plants, the Kimberly Clark Envirocomp product stewardship scheme breaks down nappies and sanitary waste into a safe, odourless compost, instead of sending them to landfill.

By February 2015, the scheme aims to process three million nappies per year.

“New Zealanders developed this solution to a waste issue that many families and businesses face. The Government saw the potential and backed it, as did global organisations which are now taking it to the world,” Ms Adams says.

“The Envirocomp product stewardship scheme demonstrates how partnerships between entrepreneurs and established businesses can take an idea and make it a reality.”

Under the scheme, people in the Canterbury and Wellington regions have their waste collected directly or take it to special collection bins. The waste is then composted at specialist facilities.

The process is designed to comply with the New Zealand Standard for Composts, Soil Conditioners and Mulches, ensuring potential pollutants and contaminants to the environment are minimised.

Envirocomp has previously received $730,000 from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund to investigate and build a Wellington composting facility.

It also received a Green Ribbon Award in 2008 for its contribution to household sustainability.

Under the Waste Minimisation Act, the Minister for the Environment has the ability to recognise product stewardship schemes through accreditation.

A product stewardship scheme will only be accredited after it has been thoroughly assessed to ensure accreditation criteria have been met. In turn, accredited schemes have to report annually to the Minister on their objectives and targets.

This is the ninth voluntary product stewardship scheme to be accredited in New Zealand.
