The Government is investing $2.5 million over a maximum of five years to support research that will increase the productivity of the forestry industry, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The funding will support the development of new technologies that can be used by pine tree breeders to reduce the time it takes to breed and plant new improved trees by 15 years.

The Radiata Pine Breeding Company, which has formed a partnership between 16 forestry organisations, Scion and the University of Canterbury, is researching and developing the new technologies.

“Science and innovation are major drivers of economic growth and international competitiveness. The Government is committed to ensuring we invest in purpose-driven research that benefits New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“The New Zealand forestry industry directly employs 20,000 people and contributes an annual gross income of $5 billion. This investment will contribute to the industry’s further expansion.

“The project will bring companies and industry bodies together to find solutions, through science and research, that will enable us to develop a more technologically advanced and economically successful forestry industry.”
