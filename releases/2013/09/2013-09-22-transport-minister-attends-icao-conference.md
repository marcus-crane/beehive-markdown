Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee will travel to Canada today to attend the 38th triennial assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) being held in Montréal.

ICAO is a specialised agency of the United Nations, established in 1944 to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation throughout the world. Mr Brownlee will lead New Zealand’s delegation to the assembly which will be attended by over 1000 Ministers and officials from around the world.

ICAO hopes the assembly will endorse two complementary plans guiding aviation safety and air navigation developments over the next 15 years. This would enable a projected world-wide doubling of air transport capacity to be safely and efficiently managed.

Other priorities for discussion will be economic policy, cargo supply chain security and the free-flow of trade.

Mr Brownlee says New Zealand has a vibrant aviation industry, which earned about $9.7 billion of revenue in 2009.

“By 2015 the New Zealand industry is expected to be earning between $12.6 and $15 billion a year.

“New Zealand supports ICAO’s efforts to develop standards and recommended practices to facilitate the safe and efficient application of new aviation technologies.

“New Zealand will be placing emphasis on encouraging a multilateral agreement to replace the current bilateral system of trading air rights, and will continue to pursue liberal air services agreements.”

Since February 2012, New Zealand has formally announced seven new air services agreements with Japan, China, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Chinese Taipei.

New Zealand has also recently reached new agreements with French Polynesia, Indonesia, Iceland, Paraguay and Uruguay.
