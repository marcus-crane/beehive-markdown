Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of Euan Mac Kellar to the Registered Architects Board.

Mr Mac Kellar is a registered architect and partner with Jasmax Architects in Auckland, and is also an adjunct professor of design at the Unitec School of Architecture. He will replace Marshall Cook in December and has been appointed for a two year term.

“Euan Mac Kellar, with his experience of working in a large architectural practice, will provide a good balance with the other Board members, who are from smaller to mid-sized practices.

“Christina Van Bohemen and Callum McKenzie have been reappointed for three year terms,” Mr Williamson says.

The Registered Architects Board is an independent statutory body responsible for regulating the architecture profession. It develops and administers rules relating to competency standards and ethics. The Board also deals with complaints and disciplines members of the profession.

“I would also like to thank Marshall Cook for his contribution to the Board,” Mr Williamson says.
