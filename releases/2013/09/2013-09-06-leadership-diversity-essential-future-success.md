Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew today reinforced that diversity of talent within organisations, at all levels, will reap rewards.

Mrs Goodhew was speaking at an event in Auckland celebrating 120 years of women’s suffrage in New Zealand.

“As we mark suffrage we have the perfect opportunity to consider how we can further progress opportunities for women in the future.

“When I look at the small number of women in leadership roles in New Zealand’s top organisations, I have to wonder whether New Zealand women are getting the opportunities to succeed that their talents warrant,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“At least 40 of our top 100 listed companies have no woman directors.

“Organisations who plan for diversity at the leadership level and at all other levels will reap the rewards. These will be the most successful organisations of the future.

“Today we have gathered to celebrate women leaders and those organisations who are proactively developing women as leaders and managers.

“But we all need to learn and take inspiration from them and challenge ourselves to do better in our own companies and organisations.”

Minister Goodhew is hosting events in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington to celebrate the 120th anniversary of women’s suffrage.
