District health boards (DHBs) are saving around $4 million a year after signing up to a collective banking arrangement says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“That’s $4 million that goes back into frontline health services,” Mr Ryall says.

“By moving to one bank nationally, DHBs have reduced their banking administration costs, standardised fees, and are earning a better rate of interest on their collective deposits,” Mr Ryall says.

“The savings are the result of a market process that was led by Health Benefits Limited (HBL) on behalf of all 20 DHBs. The process has seen Westpac Bank awarded a contract to provide banking and treasury services for all DHBs.

“The contract provides a number of benefits for DHBs including a so-called sweep arrangement where at the end of each business day all the bank accounts of DHBs have are ‘swept’ into one account and they can earn a greater rate of interest on the money collectively than they would have earned on their individual accounts.

“On any given day there is collectively between $300 million and $1.4 billion in DHB bank accounts – ready to pay employees, vendors and suppliers. So the sweep arrangement has significant savings potential.

“This is a good example of a substantial benefit from DHBs working together to save money that would otherwise have been difficult for an individual DHB or smaller group of DHBs to achieve on their own,” says Mr Ryall.

HBL works in partnership with DHBs to save money by reducing their administration, support and procurement costs. The programmes HBL and the health sector are working on have already delivered more than $200 million in savings since 2011, with most of the savings coming from using the collective purchasing power of DHBs to negotiate better prices.
