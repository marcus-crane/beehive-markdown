Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed the passing of the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Amendment Bill today.

The Amendment Bill validates a disciplinary levy and an offences fee charged by the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board, and clarifies its authority to impose a disciplinary and prosecution levy.

“It was always intended that the Board could collect money from the industry to pay for its investigations and prosecutions, including those against unlicensed cowboys. Unfortunately, the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006, which was passed by the Labour Government, was flawed and left this open to question.

“We have amended the Act and fixed Labour’s mistake. It will allow the Board to be appropriately funded to carry out all of its statutory functions, including the protection of public health and safety.

“The industry benefits from maintaining high standards and stopping unqualified people putting the public at risk and taking work from licensed plumbers, gasfitters and drainlayers,” Maurice Williamson says.
