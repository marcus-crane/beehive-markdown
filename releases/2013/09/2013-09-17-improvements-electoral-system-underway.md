A Bill proposing change to electoral law in time for the 2014 General Election has passed its first reading in Parliament today.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the Electoral Amendment Bill implements many recommendations made by the Justice and Electoral Select Committee’s Inquiry into the 2011 General Election that require a law change.

“New Zealand is fortunate that its electoral system has a very high level of integrity,” Ms Collins says.

“However, it’s important we continuously examine and improve our processes in light of lessons learnt from previous elections and changing technology.”

The changes in the Bill will improve services to voters, candidates and parties. For example greater use of EasyVote cards will simplify and speed up vote issuing at elections and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the scrutiny of the rolls.

The Bill proposes changes to improve efficiency by allowing greater use of technology. For example full online enrolment would allow new and existing electors to enrol or update their details online using the RealMe service.

Ms Collins says the Bill also makes a number of amendments to improve the integrity of elections through simplifying and clarifying the law.

The Bill has been referred to the Justice and Electoral Select Committee.
