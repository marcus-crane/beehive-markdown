Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s release of the external review of health and safety in the New Zealand Defence Force.

"I expect health and safety to be a top priority for the NZDF. It is crucial our people operate in an environment where the proper safety procedures are followed,” says Dr Coleman.

“I asked the NZDF to commission an external review to address questions raised around the culture of health and safety. Avoidable deaths are not acceptable.”

The External Safety Management Review provides the NZDF with a useful audit of health and safety. The review was conducted over a relatively short period and gives a snapshot of people’s perceptions. The panel was led by Garry Wilson, former Chief Executive of ACC.

The review found the NZDF has comparable injury rates with the Australian Defence Force, NZ Police, Corrections and Fire Service, and is safer than other high risk NZ industries. It found the NZDF has robust systems in place around its most dangerous activities such as live firing, but there are inconsistences with more routine activities. The panel also noted that the majority of injuries occur during physical training.

“The review acknowledges the steps the NZDF is taking to improve health and safety, and that the NZDF leadership is committed to delivering more effective health and safety management,” Dr Coleman says.

“Further work is required to ensure high standards are applied across the NZDF. The panel made a number of recommendations which have been accepted by the NZDF and will be incorporated into the on-going work on health and safety.

“While it takes time to implement systemic change across an organisation, I expect the NZDF to make good progress in the next 12 to 18 months. I will be asking the NZDF for regular updates, and I expect the next independent assessment will show significant progress.”
