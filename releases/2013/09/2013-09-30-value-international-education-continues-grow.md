The value of international education to the New Zealand economy continues to grow with a new report released today showing it contributed $2.6 billion and 28,000 jobs in 2012/13.

The *Economic Impact of International Education 2012/13* report by Infometrics and commissioned by Education New Zealand, shows the valuation of international students studying in New Zealand was $2.5 billion and the sale and delivery of New Zealand’s education services and products offshore was $104 million.

“This is a very pleasing result which shows the value of international education increased by around $100 million, or 3 per cent, compared to 2008,” Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“This is despite a fall in international student enrolments in New Zealand over that period due to the impacts from the Global Financial Crisis and the Christchurch Earthquakes.”

The report illustrates the significant role of Auckland in international education. As the most popular destination for international students, student spending generated $1.65 billion for Auckland’s economy, followed by $195 million for Canterbury, $177 million for Wellington, $165 million for Otago and $152 million for Waikato.

Economic contribution by sector was led by universities at $901 million, followed by private training establishments at $583 million. International students in New Zealand schools contributed $361 million to the economy, English language schools contributed $343 million, and Institutes of Technology contributed $304 million.

“International students are vital to New Zealand, both in terms of their economic contribution they make while they are studying in our country, and as ambassadors for New Zealand when they return home,” Mr Joyce says.

“International education is a very significant export earner for New Zealand and a key contributor to the strength of our international linkages.

“As part of Budget 2013, the Government is investing an additional $10 million a year over the next four years in marketing and promoting New Zealand’s international education industry, as the country targets doubling the value of international education to $5 billion by 2025.”
