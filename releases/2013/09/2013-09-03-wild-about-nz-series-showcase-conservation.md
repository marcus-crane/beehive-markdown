Tonight’s launch of a primetime TV series that showcases the most spectacular parts of New Zealand’s conservation estate will inspire people to get out and explore our own backyard, Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“The ‘Wild About New Zealand’ series, produced by NHNZ (formerly known as Natural History New Zealand), profiles some of our country’s most pristine National Parks and destinations from the mountains of the Southern Alps to the seas of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park,” Dr Smith says.

“The Department of Conservation has been providing support to NHNZ since early 2012 to make this series, including identifying locations and providing logistical support.

“This series is the perfect opportunity to showcase our natural heritage in the lead up to Conservation Week which starts on Sunday. It also highlights just how accessible the outdoors are for New Zealanders, with DOC huts and tracks scattered throughout the public conservation estate.

“This ‘Wild About NZ’ series is part of DOC’s new approach of partnering with other organisations like TVNZ and NHNZ to achieve more for conservation. We hope this series will inspire more people to get out and enjoy the Great Walks and National Parks that define who we are as New Zealanders.”
