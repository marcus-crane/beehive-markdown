Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith stands by his role in decisions made by the Department of Conservation over its submission to the Board of Inquiry on the Tukituki Catchment proposal.

“A draft 34 page submission was prepared by DOC staff in early July raising questions about the nutrient modelling of the proposal. I have consistently said I never saw this draft until Tuesday of this week and I stand by that,” Dr Smith says.

“The first I knew of there being an issue over DOC’s submission to the board was at my weekly meeting with officials on Monday 29 July. It was one of 36 items in my status report for noting and contained only two sentences on the issue of the content of the submission. I was told there were differences of opinion within the department over the submission. I said I wanted a full briefing and wanted to see the final submission. This was the only meeting I had on the issue of the submission.

“Two days later I received a full briefing and a copy of DOC’s final submission. It noted the decision DOC had made to focus its submission on the conservation issues rather than water quality and why the department had decided to do so. I did no more than note the department’s decision.

“This issue is a political beat-up by the Greens who are disappointed that DOC did not make a submission alongside Eugenie Sage opposing the project. It is quite clear this decision was made by the department.”
