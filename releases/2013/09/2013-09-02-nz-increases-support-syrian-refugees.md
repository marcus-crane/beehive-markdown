Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide almost $800,000 to assist Syrian refugees, with the funding matched dollar for dollar by non-government organisations.

“New Zealand condemns in the strongest possible terms the on-going violence and the toll it is taking on the people of Syria,” Mr McCully says.

“The latest atrocities in Syria are part of a huge humanitarian crisis in which it is estimated over 100,000 people have been killed and two million displaced. It has placed a huge burden on Syria’s neighbours.”

The funding announced today will be delivered via six New Zealand-based NGOs - Caritas, UNICEF, Tear Fund, World Vision, Christian World Service and Save the Children.

“These agencies have agreed to match any funding they received from the government dollar for dollar. This will help more than 200,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan,” Mr McCully says.

“This is an excellent example of the New Zealand Government working with NGOs to provide much needed assistance to those in urgent need.”
