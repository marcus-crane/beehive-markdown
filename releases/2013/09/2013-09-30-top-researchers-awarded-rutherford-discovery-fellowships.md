Ten of New Zealand’s top early to mid-career researchers have been awarded Rutherford Discovery Fellowships in 2013, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The Fellowships are designed to develop and foster future leaders in the New Zealand science sector.  They are funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.

“The Rutherford Discovery Fellowships provide our emerging scientific leaders each with a funding package of $800,000 over five years, that will allow them to undertake important research that will be valuable for New Zealand’s future,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Fellowships will help attract and retain our most talented early-career researchers and encourage their career development in this country.”

The Rutherford Discovery Fellowships are open to researchers within three to eight years of having completed their PhD.  The scheme was established in 2010 and now supports 40 fellows.  Their research covers a vast range of topics from language studies to Antarctic research to the search for extra-solar Planets.  By 2014, there are expected to be 50 fellows under the scheme.
