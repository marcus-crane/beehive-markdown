Health Minister Tony Ryall welcomes news of more progress with the new $1.9 million integrated health centre in Tokoroa.

“The new health centre will see community health services, local general practices and hospital services co-located on one site,” says Mr Ryall.

“All under one roof – patients will soon be able to see their GP, consult their midwife, collect their prescriptions from the pharmacy, have bloods tests taken, receive physiotherapy and visit a podiatrist.

“Demolition work to prepare the two old hospital wards for conversion is underway and the newly-named South Waikato Health Centre is planned to open before Christmas.

“This is great for the people of Tokoroa – it’s a real step forward. Having a range of health providers co-located together is going to work for patients.

“It is also good for the health professionals as they'll be working side by side – caring for the same patients.

“Integrating community health services and having better links with the hospital, is a big step towards helping people to get the right care in the right place at the right time,” says Mr Ryall.
