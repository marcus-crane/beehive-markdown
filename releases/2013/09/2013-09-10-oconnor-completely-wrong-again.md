Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says he is disappointed in false claims by Labour MP Damien O’Connor over the terms of reference for the Ministerial inquiry into whey protein concentrate contamination (WPC) incident.

“Mr O’Connor is completely wrong, again. The terms of the inquiry have been widened, not narrowed, and still cover testing by AgResearch,” says Mr Guy.

“Part b) i. of the inquiry will look at the quality and integrity of product testing. This replaces earlier wording in the draft of ‘diagnostic testing’, which could be read as only covering human health issues.

“If Mr O’Connor had bothered to contact me or my office I would have been happy to point this out before he embarrassed himself by not checking the facts.

“This adds to a catalogue of errors by Mr O’Connor in his recent press releases, including claims that Murray McCully is the Minister of Trade and that the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been subsumed into the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment – all of which is completely wrong,” says Mr Guy.
