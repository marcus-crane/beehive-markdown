Some pharmacists can now prescribe or modify medication, order and check laboratory test results, and vaccinate patients.

“A series of changes over the past few years has seen the role of these important frontline health professionals continue to expand – and patients are seeing the benefits,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“New Zealand now has 14 trained pharmacy prescribers able to prescribe a range of medicines to patients. Another seven will join them this year and the number is expected to continue to grow as more pharmacists complete the specialist training.

“Pharmacists are not only able to prescribe medication, they are also able to check laboratory test results, and in some instances order tests, to ensure patients are taking their medication correctly.

“Around half of patients don't take the right dose of their medicine at the right time. And the more medicines a person takes the more likely it is they may get doses or timing muddled.

“By having access to laboratory tests, pharmacists can more easily identify patients who are not getting the best health benefits from their medicines. They already routinely swap medicine brands to resolve side effects, alter the dosage in consultation with the prescriber, or provide patients with extra support so they take their medication correctly.

“These changes allow pharmacists to really step up and share in patient care rather than just dispense medication.

“Pharmacists are actively supporting patients to manage their blood thinning medication, warfarin. Testing and monitoring to ensure patients are taking the correct dose can now happen in the local pharmacy.

“And during the influenza season, 250 pharmacists nationwide played a role in making it easier for people to get their annual flu shot. I’ve been told people like the convenience of being able to call in to their local pharmacy, with no appointment necessary, for their flu vaccination,” says Mr Ryall.

UnitedFuture leader Peter Dunne welcomed the introduction of pharmacy prescribers.

“An important element of the National / UnitedFuture confidence and supply agreement was enhancing the role of pharmacists, and it was my privilege when Associate Minister of Health to introduce the legislation providing for pharmacist prescribers, so I am naturally delighted at this progress,” says Mr Dunne.
