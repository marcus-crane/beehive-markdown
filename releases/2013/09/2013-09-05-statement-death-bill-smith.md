Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today expressed his sorrow at the death of leading building industry figure, Bill Smith.

“The building and construction sector has lost one of its great visionaries and innovators.

“Following his early retirement as general manager of Tasman Insulation in 2008, a company he was involved with for more than 30 years, Bill became an advocate on industry matters to Government,” Mr Williamson says.

Mr Smith served on the board of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, as a director of the Building Research Association of New Zealand, chaired the Building Industry Federation and was instrumental in establishing the Construction Strategy Group, which advocates on behalf of the building industry to Government.

He also previously served as a director on the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand, and as a councillor on the Auckland Manufacturers’ Association.

“I had the pleasure of working with Bill Smith for almost five years and I will miss his enthusiastic approach to the many industry related roles he undertook.  His death is a great loss to the sector. 

“My deepest sympathies go out to his wife Susan, their three sons and family,” Mr Williamson says.
