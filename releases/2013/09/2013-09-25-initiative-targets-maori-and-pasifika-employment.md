Requests for Proposals are being sought for the expansion of the Maori and Pasifika Trades Training Initiative from the current 600 places to 3000 places.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Tariana Turia are leading the Maori and Pasifika Trades Training Initiative, which supports 18 to 34-year-olds to gain trades qualifications and apprenticeships, with the goal of a level four trade qualification and employment.

The joint initiative between the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Tertiary Education Commission to expand the programme was announced in May 2013. It will bring together education providers, Maori and Pasifika groups, and employers to support young Maori and Pasifika people to gain qualifications and find employment.

“Bringing together these groups into one partnership will ensure the training provided meets the needs of employers, learners and their communities.” Mr Joyce says. “I encourage interested groups to submit a proposal to ensure all communities are able to benefit from this new initiative.”

It builds on the success of new approaches trialled in the He Toki ki te Rika and Pasifika Trades schemes, and will bring the number of places in those schemes from 600 to 3000 by 2015.

“There’s a growing need for trades training across the country, particularly around the rebuilding of Christchurch. This initiative will help meet this need by boosting the skills of young Maori and Pasifika and in doing so, strengthen employment outcomes for those communities,” Mrs Turia says. 

“A key part of this Government’s Better Public Services programme is focused on raising the skills levels and increasing the employment rates of our young people. This initiative will give young Maori and Pasifika people the skills and support they need to succeed in both education and employment, and make a real contribution to the future of New Zealand.”

The RFP process will run for five weeks, closing on 30 October.
