Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated Police for their efforts to tackle drug dealing by gangs, following arrests across six Police districts.

250 charges have been laid, and 22 people arrested, including patched Mongrel Mob members, following the execution of 20 search warrants by 100 Police officers.

It comes at the end of an eight-month operation in which Police, supported by OFCANZ, have been targeting serious drug offending by the Mongrel Mob in Marlborough, and associates across the country.

The charges include possession and supply of drugs, including methamphetamine, theft and burglary.

“Today’s arrests follow many months of hard work and I want to thank the Police officers involved,” says Mrs Tolley.

“There is no place for gangs in our communities, or their associated drug-dealing and anti-social behaviour.

“They are criminal organisations and criminals belong behind bars.

“The fact that young children were present at some addresses shows that these people have no morals.

“Other gangs should be warned that the spotlight will soon be on them.”
