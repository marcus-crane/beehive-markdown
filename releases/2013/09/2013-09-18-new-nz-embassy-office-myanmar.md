Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the opening of a New Zealand Embassy Office in Myanmar.

“This new office in Yangon reflects Myanmar’s remarkable progress implementing political and economic reforms over the past two years,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand has substantially increased its development assistance to Myanmar, with major commitments to dairy cooperation and capacity building. There is also considerable scope for New Zealand companies to invest.”

“The opening of this office comes as the region focuses its attention on Myanmar, which as the next Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will host a number of ministerial and official level meetings throughout 2014, culminating in the East Asia Summit.”

The Embassy office is staffed by Bruce Shepherd as Chargé d’Affaires. Mr Shepherd will work with the New Zealand Embassy in Bangkok to provide consular support to New Zealanders in Myanmar.  The office is collocated with that of the Netherlands – a first for our two countries.

Mr Shepherd has extensive experience at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, international agencies and in the private sector.
