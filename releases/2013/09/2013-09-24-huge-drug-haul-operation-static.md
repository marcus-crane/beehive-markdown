Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today announced drugs worth tens of millions of dollars have been kept off the streets as a result of a seven month Customs operation targeting suspected psychoactive substances.

Operation Static, which began in February and ended this month, involved intelligence gathering, information sharing, targeting and intercepting packages, as well as conducting investigations and activity against importers.

“The great work of Customs saw a total of 379 suspected psychoactive substances, totalling more than 500 kilograms, intercepted. This included Class A, B and C drugs, controlled medicines and a range of synthetic cannabinoids and analogues.

“There was a total of 80 kilograms of Class C analogues seized, including 18 kilograms of ecstasy mimic methylone, and these drugs have a street value of $21 million. The harm prevented from keeping these analogues away from communities has been calculated at $32 million,” Maurice Williamson says.

Eleven people have been arrested to date as a result of Operation Static.

“If people want to chance their arm on importing illegal drugs then they can expect to be caught. I hope this successful Customs operation sends a clear warning to any would-be importers,” Maurice Williamson says.

Drug harm is defined as the total social costs from harmful drug use. It includes crime, lost output, health service use and other diverted resources, such as Customs and Police time.
