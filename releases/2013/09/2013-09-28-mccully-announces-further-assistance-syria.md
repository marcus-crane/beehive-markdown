Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced $2.6 million in additional funding for the Syrian crisis. 

New Zealand will provide $604,000 (US$500,000) to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and $2 million to humanitarian relief efforts in Syria and neighbouring countries.

“Together with the United Nations, the OPCW will lead the effort to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons stocks under the Geneva Framework agreed by the United States and Russia,” Mr McCully says.   

“New Zealand welcomed the framework agreement as a strong and constructive response to the horrific use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria.  New Zealand’s contribution to the OPCW Trust Fund for Syria will now assist in implementing the agreement.

“The humanitarian funding will go toward the International Committee of the Red Cross to help those affected by the conflict within Syria, the World Food Programme to assist Syrian refugees in Jordan, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency aiding Palestinian refugees also affected by the conflict.”

The additional funding brings New Zealand’s contributions to humanitarian relief efforts for those affected by the conflict in Syria to $7.46 million.
