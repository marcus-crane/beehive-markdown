An online resource to showcase new and innovative approaches to better care for older people has been launched today by Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

Showcasing Aged-care Nursing features video and stories from nurses working in district health boards and aged care facilities, delivering quality care.

Launching the series at the New Zealand Nurses Organisation conference in Wellington, Mr Ryall commented on the increasing breadth of responsibilities nurses have across the health service.

“Under this Government specialist cancer nurses have been introduced to help patients navigate their treatment journey. Nurses are also pivotal in the fight against Rheumatic Fever and we’ve also funded nurses to deliver school based health services in decile 1 to 3 secondary schools.”

Mrs Goodhew said New Zealand’s ageing population is increasing and older people are living longer and healthier lives.

“This is to be celebrated, however it does pose a challenge for health services with greater demands on services and supports for older New Zealanders,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The good news – as these case studies show – is DHBs and aged care providers across the health service have been looking at how they can deliver a high standard of care as demand rises.

“It’s also great to see nurses taking a leadership role in this work. A strong nursing workforce is recognised as the key to high-quality health care for older people in the future.”

Five regions – Counties Manukau, Taranaki, Waitemata, Canterbury and Wellington – feature in the Ministry of Health project.

“We would like to thank all the nursing teams and, particularly the patients and their families, who took part in this project,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The case studies and videos are available on the Ministry of Health website:  [www.health.govt.nz/agedcarevideo](http://www.health.govt.nz/agedcarevideo). A booklet has also been produced with the highlights of the project and is available and on the website.
