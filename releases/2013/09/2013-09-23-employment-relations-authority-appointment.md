Labour Minister Simon Bridges has announced the appointment of Rosemary Monaghan as interim Chief of the Employment Relations Authority.

Ms Monaghan was appointed to the Authority in October 2000 following six years as a mediator and adjudicator on the Employment Tribunal. She is an experienced Barrister, having practised in Chambers and in several legal roles.

“Rosemary Monaghan will lead the organisation until June next year following the recent decision by Chief Alastair Dumbleton to step down from the Authority. The recruitment process to select a new permanent Chief will begin in early 2014,” Mr Bridges says.

“The ERA performs a very important role in New Zealand’s employment relations system. It investigates and works to resolve employment relationship problems, and Ms Monaghan has considerable experience in this area.”

Mr Bridges also thanked Mr Dumbleton for his dedicated service to the Authority for the past 13 years.
