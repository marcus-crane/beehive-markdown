Finance Minister Bill English will visit Vietnam and Singapore next week, where he will meet a number of business, investment and political leaders.

“South East Asia is an important trade and investment partner for New Zealand and it’s essential that we retain close relationships with this region,” he says.

The 10 countries of South East Asia took $4.3 billion of New Zealand exports in the year to June 2013.

“New Zealand is fortunate to have a region on its doorstep which continues to show healthy growth – including Vietnam and Singapore - at a time when many other parts of the world are still struggling with little growth and high debt. I’m looking forward to exchanging ideas about the global and regional economies in both countries.”

During what will be his first visit to Vietnam, Mr English is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh and Finance Minister Dinh Tien Dung. He will also meet business leaders with an interest in expanding trade and investment links with New Zealand.

In Singapore, Mr English will meet Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.  Mr English will also be the guest speaker at a business event hosted by the New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Singapore.

He leaves New Zealand on 15 September and returns on 19 September.
