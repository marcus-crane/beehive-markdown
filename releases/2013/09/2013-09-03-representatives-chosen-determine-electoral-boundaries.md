Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the appointment of the four political nominees on the Representation Commission.

The Commission is responsible for determining the number of electoral districts in New Zealand and fixing the boundaries for those electorates.

“The Government’s representatives will be Hon Roger Sowry and, for the Māori electoral boundaries, Daniel Te Kanawa,” Ms Collins says.

“Representing the Opposition parties will be Hon Pete Hodgson and, for the Māori electoral boundaries, Whetu Wereta.”

When setting the general electoral district boundaries, the Commission consists of the Chairperson, four ex officio members (the Surveyor-General, the Government Statistician, the Chief Electoral Officer and the Chairperson of the Local Government Commission) and two political representatives, appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of Parliament – one to represent the Government and one to represent the Opposition.

When setting the Māori electoral district boundaries, the Commission’s membership consists of all the members described above, plus the Chief Executive of Te Puni Kokiri, and two political representatives, who must be Māori, appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of Parliament, one to represent the Government and one the Opposition.
