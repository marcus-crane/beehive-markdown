Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss says the fact that musical online series *The Factory* has had over 250,000 views shows that NZ On Air’s Digital Media Fund allocation is being directed in the right place.

*The Factory* is an innovative online series, which started with auditions in markets, shopping centres, community halls and festivals around South Auckland to find new talent, songs and stories for the series.

Among other initiatives in its first year, NZ On Air’s Digital Media Fund has also supported an iPad app for kids, *Lets Get Inventin’*, and another popular online series about small town New Zealand, *Woodville,* which has recently been picked up by the Sydney Morning Herald. In addition the fund allowed 22,000 people from 31 countries to watch a live stream of *The 2013 Big Sing Secondary Schools* choralecompetition finale.

“The way Kiwis receive content is changing, watching the television in your lounge is no longer the only mode of distribution,” says Mr Foss.

NZ On Air has also recently funded a New Zealand music channel on iHeartradio, and continues to work on ways to ensure New Zealand music is accessible across a range of platforms.

“NZ On Air is embracing technological changes and adjusting the way they fund content to include online digital platforms.

The Digital Media Fund is an annual opportunity which attracts a wide range of applications for innovative content creation ideas, but across all their funding areas NZ On Air now expects its funded content to play on at least two platforms, recognising changing audience behaviour,” says Mr Foss.

The Factory series ended last week but all episodes can be found online at [www.thefactorystory.co.nz](http://www.thefactorystory.co.nz).
