New Zealand businesses could learn from the diversity of the New Zealand-China relationship, Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins told an assembly at Chinese National Day celebrations last night.

“Diversity gives the New Zealand-China relationship real strength, and it gives me great confidence that our partnership will continue to expand and thrive,” Ms Collins says.

“Chinese people bring experience as leaders of industry and agriculture to our shores and China’s growing prominence in New Zealand’s society will influence how this country develops in the coming years.”

The knowledge and connections of Chinese Kiwis contribute to New Zealand’s innovation, productivity, and access to wider markets and help our companies consider new possibilities, and different perspectives.

“I encourage New Zealand businesses to draw on the expertise and talent of Chinese kiwis, who understand the language and the culture, and who are well placed to assist at board level and in senior management positions.”

Ms Collins says the Office of Ethnic Affairs nomination service has a wealth of ethnic people from a range of backgrounds who are well suited to take on these roles.

“Having diverse staff within business management encourages us to push the boundaries and brings innovation into our New Zealand businesses.

“Diversity can give businesses a real advantage, whether they are trading locally, nationally or on the world stage.”
