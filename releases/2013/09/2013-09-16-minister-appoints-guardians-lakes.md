Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced one new appointment and three re-appointments to the Guardians of the Lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau.

“The Guardians were established under the Conservation Act as a result of the Save Manapouri Campaign and have a prominent place in the history of conservation in New Zealand. They report annually to the Government on matters arising from the environmental, ecological and social impacts of the power schemes on lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau,” Dr Smith says.

“The Guardians also make recommendations to Government concerning the operating guidelines for these lakes.”

William Jarvie from Te Anau is a new appointment while Teresa McClelland has been reappointed as chair and Jane Davis and Muriel Johnstone as the Ngāi Tahu representatives for the Guardians. The appointments are for terms of five years.

There are currently eight Guardians of the Lakes: Teresa McClelland, Sue Bennett, Fred Inder, Marc Schallenberg, Ian Welsh, Darryl Sycamore, Jane Davis, and Muriel Johnstone.
