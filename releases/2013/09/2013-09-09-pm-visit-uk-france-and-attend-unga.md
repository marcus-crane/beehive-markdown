Prime Minister John Key will visit the United Kingdom, France and the United Nations in New York from 17-29 September.

Mr Key’s visit to Britain will include bilateral meetings with UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Foreign Secretary William Hague and the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Milliband.

In France, Mr Key will meet President Francois Hollande, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, and Economy and Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici. This will be Mr Key’s first visit to France since Mr Hollande became President last year.

“Europe remains vital to New Zealand’s future prosperity and security,” says Mr Key.

“This visit is an opportunity to talk about Europe with two key EU member states. Both are also permanent members of the UN Security Council. Their perspectives on regional and global issues are of strong interest to New Zealand.

“Our common engagement in the Asia-Pacific region and the opportunities this presents will also be a focus of my discussions in Europe,” says Mr Key.

At the invitation of The Queen, Mr Key and his family will also make a private visit to join Her Majesty at the royal residence of Balmoral in Scotland on the weekend of 20-22 September.

The visit to Balmoral was first scheduled to take place in September 2010, but Mr Key’s travel was cancelled at that time because of the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake.

In New York, Mr Key will attend the opening week of the United Nations General Assembly.

The opening week of the United Nations General Assembly is the single largest gathering of world leaders, where global issues such a response to developments in Syria are likely to be a key focus.

The week will also be an opportunity to advance New Zealand interests, and to promote New Zealand’s candidate for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2015/16.

“Small states like New Zealand need to have a place at the UN’s top table. New Zealand shares the desire of other countries to see a strong and effective United Nations.”

Mr Key is scheduled to deliver a statement in the general debate on Thursday 26 September, attend bilateral meetings with other world leaders and have high level policy discussions on key topics on the UN agenda. Mr Key will be accompanied in New York by Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully.
