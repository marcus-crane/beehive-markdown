Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss says Lower North Island residents have a few days left to ensure they can keep watching television.

“While nine out of ten households are already watching digital TV, I urge everyone to make sure they’re ready before Sunday 29 September,” says Mr Foss.

Television in the Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast went digital in September 2012. The rest of the South Island went digital on 28 April, 2013.

Auckland and the rest of the North Island will make the switch to digital television on 1 December 2013.

“Almost all televisions can be made digital ready with a set-top box so you don’t necessarily need to buy a new television.  If you’re already watching Freeview, Sky, Igloo or Vodafone cable TV, you’re already watching digital TV.
