Minister for Small Business John Banks today congratulated Chia Limited, the Supreme Winner of Business.govt.nz’s ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition.  

Chia Limited produces naturally flavoured bottled drinks containing the chia seed, a natural ‘superfood’ that is a rich source of vegetable Omega 3, complete protein, minerals, electrolytes, fibre, and antioxidants.

The Nelson-based company is co-owned by father and daughter Ben and Chloe Van Dyke, who both share a passion for health and sport.

“Chia Limited’s win is well-deserved. The competition was tough, but they won by displaying passion as well as innovation and attention to detail in their submitted business plan,” Mr Banks said.

“Chia Limited is a shining example of what to get right when getting your business to take off to a flying start.”

As part of Chia Limited’s win, director Chloe Van Dyke will receive a $58,000 prize package that includes $30,000 of growth funding from ANZ and access to top business training and advice.

Second and third place winners, and 14 regional winners, were also announced today at the competition awards ceremony which took place at the Wharewaka Function Centre in Wellington.

While the second and third place winners will each receive $5,000 in cash from Gold Sponsors ANZ, each regional winner will receive $1,000 cash from award sponsors Ernst & Young, MYOB, OpenHost and Servcorp.

“Every year Business.govt.nz’s ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition shines a light on the entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude of every day New Zealanders,” Mr Banks said.

“We’re a nation of entrepreneurs and the level and quality of the entries this competition receives every year stands as proof of that.

“If you’re thinking of starting a business start writing your business plan now, and start using the free resources provided online at Business.govt.nz.”
