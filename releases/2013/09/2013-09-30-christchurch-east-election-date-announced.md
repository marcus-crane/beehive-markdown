The Christchurch East by-election will be held on Saturday 30 November, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

The by-election is required following the resignation of Labour MP Lianne Dalziel.

“I have been advised that given that Ms Dalziel’s resignation will take effect on 11 October, it is now appropriate to set a date for the by-election,” says Mr Key.

“The by-election Writ Day will be Wednesday 30 October. The last day for candidate nominations to be received will be Tuesday 5 November and the last day for the return of the Writ will be Thursday 19 December.”
