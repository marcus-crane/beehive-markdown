International Education will be a key focus of discussions when Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce visits Japan and Korea next week.

The Minister leaves tomorrow to meet with Japanese and South Korean Government ministers and officials and attend New Zealand education events in both countries.

The events include receptions for New Zealand-educated alumni and meetings with education leaders. He will also speak to high school students, including Japanese students who are coming to New Zealand on recently-established scholarships, and will open an education fair in South Korea.

“With its strong reputation for delivering high-quality education, New Zealand has built a rich education history with both Japan and South Korea and there is plenty of scope for further strengthening our cooperation in this key area,” Mr Joyce says.

“In addition to our strong education links, we regard both countries as strategic partners in science and innovation. I’m looking forward to discussing the opportunities for New Zealand to collaborate further on research and scientific exchange initiatives that will deliver benefits for all.”

The next New Zealand Japan Joint Committee Meeting on Science and Technology Cooperation will be held in Wellington later this month.

“New Zealand’s trade linkages and bilateral relationships with Japan and Korea are extremely important for our economic development. I will be looking to build on these relationships during my visit.”

Minister Joyce will be in Japan from 8-11 September, and in South Korea from 11- 14 September 2013.
