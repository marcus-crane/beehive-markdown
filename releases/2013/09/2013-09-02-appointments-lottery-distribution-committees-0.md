Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced 22 appointments across 10 Lottery Distribution Committees.

“Distribution committees fund a range of great projects and programmes and make a major contribution to communities up and down the country, says Mr Tremain. 

“The appointees bring a wealth of knowledge, experience and community connections, and will help ensure the committees continue to be well-placed to do their work.”
