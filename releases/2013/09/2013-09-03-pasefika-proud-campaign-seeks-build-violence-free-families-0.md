The Pasefika Proud Campaign is seeking to build violence free families by drawing on the strengths of Pasefika peoples and their culture.

At the campaign launch today, Associate Minister of Social Development Tariana Turia said the Pasefika Proud campaign is about changing behaviours – about prevention rather than dealing with violence in a crisis. The campaign will run for a minimum of two years, driven by the Pacific Media Network and funded by the Ministry of Social Development.

“It’s one thing to say ‘enough is enough’ but it’s quite another to know what to do about it. Pasefika Proud helps to make the transformation possible by sending out a number of positive messages aimed at the importance and benefits of loving, caring, and being with family,” says Mrs Turia.

“I’m excited that Pacific Media Network has chosen organisations such as the Pacific Island Safety and Prevention Project and the Police to work closely with them on this campaign. The work the Pacific Island Safety and Prevention Project is inspirational with its energy, vitality and unmistakeable sense of voice. It restores faith and culture, and instils pride and self-belief in families and communities.”

“Today’s launch is about reaching out to all Pacific people – dads and daughters, grandparents and their grandchildren, mothers and their sons. A key focus of the social networking side of Pasefika Proud will be to reach the younger generation,” says Mrs Turia.

“The Pasefika Proud Campaign is aimed at families at home, but it also reaches into streets and neighbourhoods, churches and workplaces, youth groups, pubs and clubs, supermarkets and sports grounds – wherever Pasefika peoples come into contact with each other.”

“Pasefika Proud is a strengths-based approach using our culture as a way of exploring positive solutions,” said Fa’amatuainu Tino Pereira, Chair of the Pacific Advisory Group to the Taskforce Against Violence Within Families.

“It will allow our Pacific communities to truly engage on all of the challenges that face us in our efforts to address family violence,” says Mr Pereira.

“We all want to see strong, resilient Pacific families who live in connected communities that are prepared to take positive action against violence,” says Mrs Turia.

“This is about changing people’s behaviours and attitudes towards violence to all work together to create loving families and raise happy and healthy children.”
