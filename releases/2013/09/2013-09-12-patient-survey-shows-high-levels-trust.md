A new patient experience survey released today shows New Zealanders report they are getting better health services says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Key findings from the New Zealand Health Survey 2011/12 on Patient Experience and Emergency Department (ED) Use show eight out of ten adults rated the quality of care they received from ED as good or very good.

People also have high levels of trust and confidence in doctors and nurses working in both general practice and hospitals.

Health Minister Tony Ryall is welcoming the findings saying a lot of work has been done to make sure New Zealanders receive better health services in the right place and at the right time.

"We've made shorter stays in ED a priority. Latest health target results show significant improvements have been made with 93 per cent of patients now admitted, discharged or transferred from EDs within six hours,” says Mr Ryall.

“It's really great to hear that two out of three people in the survey reported having an even better experience – being treated in ED within an hour.

“We've also focused on better links between health professionals working in general practices and hospitals to improve the quality of patient care. 

“I'm pleased to hear nine out of ten adults, who'd recently been treated in hospital, thought their medical centre was informed about their care after their last visit to an ED or hospital,” says Mr Ryall.

 

More than 12,000 adults and 4000 children took part in the New Zealand Health Survey 2011/12.

Key findings on Patient Experience and ED Use survey include:

- Most adults (93 per cent) and children (97 per cent) have a GP clinic or medical centre that they usually go to when they are unwell or injured.
- Nine out of ten adults rated the quality of care they received from their GP and medical specialist as good or very good. This figure was the same for children.
- The main reason people went to the ED was for a life threatening or serious conditions (46 per cent adults and 45 per cent children).
- Few people said they went to the ED because of cost issues (2.4 per cent adults and 1.8 per cent children).

Information from the survey will be used by the Ministry of Health, district health boards, public health units, and health providers for planning purposes.
