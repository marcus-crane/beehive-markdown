Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has made it clear to Transfield Services that she expects the company to pay its contractors as quickly as possible.

“It is my expectation that Transfield Services should be looking to make these payments without further delay.

“Transfield Services needs to explain exactly why this situation has developed, what it is doing to resolve it and give an assurance that it will not happen again.

“It is disappointing for the contractors and their families that they have not been paid and I am eager to see this rectified.”

Ms Adams has asked Crown Fibre Holdings, which oversees the ultra-fast broadband (UFB) project on the Government’s behalf, to work closely with Transfield Services until the situation is resolved.

“I am advised that the issue with Transfield Services only involves a limited number of contractors. It is disappointing that this situation has occurred, and I have made it clear to Transfield Services through Crown Fibre Holdings that this needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

“It is not good enough when a contractor does a fair day’s work, but then does not get paid. I want to see people get paid for the work they have done”

Ms Adams says it is important to note that the issue was unlikely to have an impact on the overall UFB build programme.

“The overall programme is well on track and business is continuing as usual across much of the country. From time to time these situations occur, but I have made it very clear to all involved that I am far from happy.”

 

**Additional information:**

On behalf of the Government, Crown Fibre Holdings holds contracts with Chorus and the Local Fibre Companies to roll out the UFB project. These organisations in-turn engage providers such as Transfield for civil and engineering works.

In this particular instance, Transfield has sub-contracted with a number of other companies to help with the roll-out of UFB and to meet contractual commitments it has with a Local Fibre Company or Chorus.
