Courts Minister Chester Borrows will depart for the United Kingdom today to address the Restorative Justice Council’s Annual General Meeting.

“Restorative justice is a growing field in responding to crime, with huge benefits for the victim and for society,” says Mr Borrows.

“The Restorative Justice Council’s AGM will be a great opportunity to share ideas and experiences with our international colleagues.”

Mr Borrows will also visit restorative justice practitioners in Manchester, Leeds and Hull. Leeds and Hull are two of four international Restorative Cities where restorative practices are promoted in dispute resolution across workplaces, schools and community organisations. Whanganui, in Mr Borrows’ own electorate, is one of these four restorative cities.

“While in England I will also take the opportunity to discuss Courts modernisation with UK Ministers and officials, as well as viewing the new ‘digital court’ in Birmingham.

“Modernising the way our courts operate is a significant, but worthwhile, challenge. Anything we can learn from similar jurisdictions could yield huge benefits for the way New Zealanders interact with our justice system.”

While in transit Mr Borrows will spend one day in Singapore discussing courtroom technology with Singaporean judges, and on the return leg further meetings with restorative justice providers and academics in Halifax and Toronto. Halifax is the fourth of the four international restorative cities.
