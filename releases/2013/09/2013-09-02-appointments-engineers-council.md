Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced two appointments to the Chartered Professional Engineers Council.

Anthony Wilson and Ross Tanner have been appointed for three years.

“Mr Wilson, who will replace Arthur O’Leary in October, will broaden the skills base of the Council from a local government and local regulatory perspective.

“Mr Tanner, who is a specialist advisor on public policy and management, and governance and strategy, will bring a mix of skills that will add to the Council. He replaces Andrew Read,” Mr Williamson says.

Roland Frost and Andrew Hazelton have been reappointed to the Board for three and two year terms respectively.

“I would like to thank the contribution departing members Arthur O’Leary and Andrew Read have made to the Council,” Mr Williamson says.

The Chartered Professional Engineers Council reviews and approves rules containing chartered professional engineering standards and hears appeals on registrations.
