Education Minister Hekia Parata today met with the New Zealand Teachers Council (NZTC) and asked them to urgently review cancellations of the registration of teachers with serious convictions.

The Minister was responding to reports in the weekend media that revealed that at least two high profile convicted sex offenders were still listed as registered teachers.

“As I said on the weekend, and reiterated to the NZTC today, common sense needs to prevail in situations like this. I have asked the NZTC to rapidly reassess how they process the deregistration of teachers, to ensure that the sort of situation that was revealed over the weekend does not happen again.

“It is important that the public continues to have confidence in our teaching profession, and I made it clear to the NZTC today that the sort of instances revealed over the weekend undermines that confidence, which has an impact on all teachers.

“The NZTC gave me an undertaking that they would move to process cancellations of teacher registrations where such teachers had serious convictions against them as quickly as possible in the future,” says Ms Parata.
