Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain is visiting China this week with a particular focus on building a closer working relationship with the China National Tourism Administration.

The Minister will visit Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong from 9-13 September.

“The China-New Zealand tourism relationship is a high priority, with China now our second largest source of overseas visitors,” says Mr Tremain.

“Meetings with the China National Tourism Administration, and with regional tourism bureaus, will be an opportunity to discuss recent initiatives to encourage Chinese visitors to New Zealand, such as streamlined visa processes and a focus on visitor safety.

“My visit also comes just prior to a new tourism law coming into effect in China. The new law provides outbound Chinese tourists with greater consumer protection by prohibiting the sale of below-cost shopping tours.

“While in China I will be emphasising our commitment to working constructively with respect to the new law, and gaining insights into its impact on visitors to New Zealand. 

“I will also be meeting with key airline partners and some of China’s premier travel sellers, who have built close relationships with Tourism New Zealand.”
