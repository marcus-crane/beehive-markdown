A new cardiac procedure for people whose blood pressure remains high even when on blood pressure lowering medicines will be part of a $1.2 million two year trial starting early next year.

“The trial uses renal denervation, a half-hour procedure that ‘zaps’ the nerves to the kidney to reduce blood pressure,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“While this new treatment is still in its very early stages, it shows considerable promise for lowering blood pressure and in turn lowering the risk of heart attacks, heart disease and stroke.

“The trial will provide valuable information about how renal denervation can be used to help New Zealanders with resistant high blood pressure.

“Hundreds of people with resistant high blood pressure from Auckland, Waikato and Christchurch will be involved in the trial,” says Mr Ryall.

The trial is being led by University of Auckland’s Heart Foundation Professor of Heart Health Robert Doughty and is supported by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.

The trial was selected from four different cardiac procedures considered for further study by the National Health Committee in partnership with the Health Research Council.
