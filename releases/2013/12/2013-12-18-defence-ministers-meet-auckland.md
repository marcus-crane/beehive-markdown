Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman is holding bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart, Senator David Johnston in Auckland today.

“New Zealand has a strong defence relationship with Australia, and I look forward to working closely with Senator Johnston,” says Dr Coleman.

“As part of our bilateral meeting, we will be discussing the current security issues in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as identifying areas where New Zealand and Australia can further develop our practical defence co-operation.

“Following the release of the Australia-New Zealand Defence Relationship Framework Review in 2012, both countries agreed to a regular timetable of senior engagement by ministers, military commanders and officials. At the same time, we are looking to continually build on the literally hundreds of trans-tasman defence engagements that occur each year.

“For example, the NZ Navy currently has three sailors embarked on HMAS Melbourne on counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. Last month, an Australian contingent took part in Exercise Southern Katipo, New Zealand’s largest ever multinational exercise. Earlier this year, with the closedown of our missions in Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands, we worked together to extract equipment. The relationship is one of practical, two-way co-operation.”

In addition to holding bilateral talks in Auckland today, Senator Johnston will lay a wreath at the Auckland War Memorial and he will tour the Navy’s multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury.
