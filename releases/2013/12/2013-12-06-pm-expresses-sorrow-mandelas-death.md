Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sadness at the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela.

“Nelson Mandela was an inspirational leader, and a remarkable man,” says Mr Key.

“On behalf of the New Zealand people and the Government, I would like to express my sincere condolences to both his family and all South Africans.

“For years he symbolised South Africa’s hope for a future free from apartheid.

“Mr Mandela was a force for change, not only in South Africa, but around the world.

“In his time as President he helped South Africa come to terms with its past, and, through reconciliation, built the foundations for a stronger nation.”

A delegation headed by the Prime Minister will represent New Zealand at the funeral.
