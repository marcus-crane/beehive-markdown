Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is welcoming the approval of New Zealand meat exports to enter Peru.

Peruvian authority SENASA has approved the listing of all New Zealand exporters currently interested in exporting beef, sheep meat and offal into the country. The listings are valid for three years and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has the option to request the addition of further exporters.

“This approval to export beef and sheep products to Peru is great news for the meat industry. It gives our exporters access to a market with a value (based on 2011 imports) of at least US$19 million, with significant potential for growth.

“This is more good news, following the Chinese Taipei economic agreement which will phase out beef tariffs in 2015.

“Once again, it shows the importance of trade deals in helping drive our primary industries. This reinforces the importance of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which could have major benefits to New Zealand.

“This new arrangement also provides opportunities for Peruvian manufacturers and retailers to benefit from the enhanced supply chain arrangements, providing their customers with access to New Zealand’s high quality red meat products.”

The arrangement marks the culmination of around three years of negotiations with SENASA by MPI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“Dairy trade to Peru has already been successful for some time and worth around $120 million. This has now been strengthened with formal listing and recognition of New Zealand dairy premises. This reflects the positive growth in the relationship.

“Peru as an important trading partner for New Zealand, and the completion of bilateral trade arrangements is a great outcome for both countries.

“Latin America is a fast growing region with major potential for more trade growth, which is why I’ve made two visits to the region this year.

“This is a great outcome for New Zealand exporters and our economy, and an important contribution to the Business Growth Agenda,” says Mr Guy.
