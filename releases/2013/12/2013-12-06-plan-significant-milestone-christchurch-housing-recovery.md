Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed the release of the Land Use Recovery Plan by Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

“Christchurch faces a unique set of housing challenges from the damage of tens of thousands of homes in the earthquakes, the demand for temporary accommodation while homes are fixed, and the influx of rebuild workers needing accommodation. These factors have put significant pressure on both Canterbury’s rental and home ownership markets,” Dr Smith says.

“This overarching plan provides a crucial blueprint for both greenfield and intensified urban development and has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 new homes.

“The plan recognises the need to act quickly to relieve Christchurch’s immediate housing pressures but also to work with local government, communities and iwi to ensure the long-term viability of the rebuild.

“The plan also enables Housing New Zealand to deliver on its ambitious Canterbury Investment Plan which includes the repair of 5000 homes and the building of 700 new ones by the end of 2015.

“I look forward to working collaboratively with the Christchurch City Council to explore initiatives to complement the plan and ensure the recovery of Christchurch’s housing market to at least pre-quake levels.”
