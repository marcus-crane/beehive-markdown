Customs Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed the discovery of $72 million of methamphetamine pre-cursor drugs at the Ports of Auckland.

Detectives from the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand, working with Customs Officers, yesterday intercepted 248 kilograms of pseudoephedrine and 16 kilograms of pure ephedrine when a shipping container arrived at the port.

Intelligence gathered from the 18 month long Operation Ghost, which terminated this month and saw $100 million in pre-cursor drugs seized, was critical in identifying the importation.

“This second big drugs haul is another warning shot to criminals that if you chance your arm on importing these vile drugs that we will catch you.

“Intelligence tools and methods being used by Government agencies have improved out of sight in recent years and it’s only a matter of time before these drug importers are caught.

“I have to reiterate the Government will stop at nothing to find and dismantle drug rings, and individual importers, that seek to harm our communities with their insidious products,” Maurice Williamson says.

In total, 594 kilograms of pre-cursor drugs have been seized as a result of Operation Ghost.
