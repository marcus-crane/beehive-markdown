Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced that Project Management Company MWH (New Zealand) had been awarded the contract to manage the minor repairs programme for 3600 earthquake damaged Christchurch state houses with less than $40,000 worth of damage.

“The awarding of this contract is an important step towards the goal of having all 5000 earthquake damaged Housing New Zealand homes fixed and another 700 built by the end of 2015,” Dr Smith says.

“The first phase of Housing New Zealand’s recovery programme was the 27,000 urgent and emergency repairs to make homes safe for tenants. The second phase was getting Housing New Zealand’s insurance claim, the largest ever in New Zealand’s history, settled for $320 million. I’m further pleased to announce that Housing New Zealand has met its target for the third phase of having 550 of the 5000 earthquake repairs completed this year.

“This minor repairs contract involves $100 million of work, will employ about 1000 tradespeople and covers 3600 of the 5000 repairs to be completed by the end of 2015.

“Negotiations are continuing with interested parties to award the contract for the major repairs programme for houses with damage worth more than $40,000. I expect that to be wrapped up early in the new year.

“95 per cent of Housing New Zealand homes were damaged in the earthquakes and this is contributing to the challenges of housing families in need. This further progress in getting Housing New Zealand homes fully repaired shows that momentum is now well underway to support Christchurch’s recovery.”
