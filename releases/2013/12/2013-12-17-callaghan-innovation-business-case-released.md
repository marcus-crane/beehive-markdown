Minister of Science and Innovation Steven Joyce today released the final Business Case for the development and growth of Callaghan Innovation, New Zealand’s new innovation partner for Kiwi businesses, over the next three years.

Mr Joyce says the Business Case lays out how Callaghan will support New Zealand’s business and science sectors to be more innovative and competitive.

“Increasing innovation and the commercialisation of new products in New Zealand’s High Value Manufacturing and Services (HVMS) sectors is crucial for improving the international competitiveness of Kiwi firms and increasing economic growth. In the context of a high kiwi dollar and a sluggish world economic recovery, it is the innovative Kiwi firms that are successfully competing and growing.”

Mr Joyce says that Callaghan Innovation is a unique organisation that will evolve over time and be shaped by the businesses it serves.  “New Zealand businesses have made it clear they want a one-stop shop to go to for their R&D assistance, their technical support and advice. Callaghan Innovation’s Business Case identifies specific ways that it will achieve this mandate.”

“Callaghan has already made good progress towards being the hi-tech HQ for New Zealand business. In the 10 months since it launched, it has supported 220 customers with research and technical projects, and more than 470 businesses have been assisted on the path to commercialisation with R&D grants worth more than $35 million.”

Other Business Case initiatives include:

- helping firms to take their ideas to market by establishing a programme of specialist research and technical services, including a team of client solutions managers
- becoming a one-stop-shop to make it easier for businesses to enter and navigate the science and innovation system
- administration of the government’s R&D and incubator support programmes, which includes the development and roll-out of a new network of technology-focused incubators
- enhancing the innovation precinct at its Gracefield site to foster greater collaboration and networking across New Zealand’s science and innovation community.

The Business Case acknowledges the importance of working in partnership with key organisations, including NZ Trade and Enterprise, tertiary providers, Crown Research Institutes, regional Economic Development Agencies, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and the venture capital community.

Callaghan was established as a new Crown agent on 1 February this year to support high-value manufacturing and services (HVMS) firms to improve their growth and competitiveness.
