Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows is urging students to apply for their 2014 Student Loan and Allowance by Monday 16 December.

“This year StudyLink has been very clear that the best way for students to make sure their financial support is sorted when they start studying is by applying by December 16,” says Mr Borrows.

“This will allow enough time for all the steps in the application process to be completed before the start of their 2014 study. If they don't apply on time or provide all the information needed they run the risk of not getting their payments on time.”

During the busiest times of the year it can take 8 weeks or more to finalise an application, particularly for complex applications requiring additional information such as parent’s income.

Over 200,000 loan and allowance applications are expected for the start of the 2014 academic year.

44,000 students have applied for their finances to date, 20 per cent ahead of this time last year. Mr Borrows says it’s a good start, and students need to make sure that they don’t leave things until the last minute.

“StudyLink has been very proactive in pushing the “apply early” message this year.  Already they have sent 370,000 emails, 20,000 texts, and used Twitter, Facebook, education providers and student associations to get the message out there,” says Mr Borrows.

Students can apply now even if they haven’t decided where or what they will be studying. That information can be changed later. It’s more important to allow enough time for all the steps in the application process to be completed.

Students can find out more about the application process on the StudyLink website ([www.studylink.govt.nz](http://www.studylink.govt.nz)) and can also track the progress of their application online using their MyStudyLink account.
