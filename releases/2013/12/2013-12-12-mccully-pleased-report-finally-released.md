Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says he is pleased the State Services Commission report on unauthorised disclosures from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) has finally been released.

“This process has been a distraction from the serious task of improving New Zealand’s external relationships and building a stronger foreign ministry,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully says he did not see the report or any part of it until yesterday.

“This report was commissioned and managed by the State Services Commissioner, not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, there are two or three take-outs from the report that are worth reinforcing.

“The report finds that a very small number of individuals in the Ministry engaged in unprofessional and disreputable conduct designed to undermine proposed changes within the Ministry. It also makes clear that the worst, and possibly only serious offenders, are no longer with the Ministry.

“The report suggests that a number of officials were placed under pressure from a former Minister, Phil Goff, to release information that they were not entitled to release.

“It also records that a former researcher from the Parliamentary offices of the Labour Party found employment at the State Services Commission, had possession of the leaked Cabinet papers and was unable to satisfactorily explain the scanning of documents that exactly matched the size of the two papers.

“I believe the public can draw their own conclusions both as to the actions of this individual and the role played by Mr Goff.”
