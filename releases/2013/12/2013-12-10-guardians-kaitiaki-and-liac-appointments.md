Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced the 2013 appointments to the two bodies that support the National Library of New Zealand.

“I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Helen Walker as a Member of the Guardians Kaitiaki of the Alexander Turnbull Library for a further term. Helen will continue to bring financial knowledge and general governance expertise to the Guardians Kaitiaki,” says Mr Tremain.

“This appointment will ensure the Turnbull Library will continue to serve and develop in ways that are appropriate for the nation’s pre-eminent research library.

“I have also appointed Sharon Dell as a member of the Library and Information Advisory Commission (LIAC) for a three-year. Sharon will bring library and information management expertise to LIAC’s skill profile. She is currently the Hocken Librarian at the University of Otago.

“LIAC’s role is to advise me on the latest developments and opportunities within the library and information sector. It remains well placed to handle the challenges ahead. “
