Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced a new stakeholder advisory group that will help Callaghan Innovation, the Government’s new high-tech HQ for business, achieve its mission of helping businesses grow through commercialising innovation.

“This nine-member panel will be an important source of independent expert advice for Callaghan Innovation’s Board as it aligns with business needs,” Mr Joyce says.

Chair of the group is Dr Andrew Coy, Chief Executive of Wellington technology company Magritek.

“Dr Coy is highly respected for both his commercial and technical experience, having worked in senior management roles for companies in Sydney and London. He co-founded Magritek along with Sir Paul Callaghan, is a 2011 Sir Peter Blake Emerging Leader, and was a member of the team that won the 2010 Prime Minister’s Science Prize,” Mr Joyce says.

The other eight members who will make up the advisory group are:

- Paul Adams, founder of EverEdge IP
- Tom Greally, General Manager of Weta Digital
- Brett Hewlett, CEO of Comvita
- Peter Landon-Lane, CEO of Plant and Food Research
- Frank Owen, Managing Director of Tait Communications
- Suse Reynolds, founder of Angel HQ
- Claire Robinson, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Creative Arts at Massey University
- Charlotte Walshe, CEO of Dynamic Controls

“Both the business and science communities are well represented in this stakeholder advisory group. Between them the members have expertise in the manufacturing, research and services sectors and strong involvement in science and technology industries,” Mr Joyce says.

“This panel of experts will support the Callaghan Innovation Governance Board to deliver fresh thinking, and offer a diversity of perspective and experience that will help grow New Zealand’s economy through science and innovation.”
