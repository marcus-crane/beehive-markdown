The Government is calling for submissions to update and help shape its National Drug Policy, Associate Minister of Health Todd McClay announced today.

The National Drug Policy aims to minimise the harm caused by tobacco, alcohol, illegal and other drugs by setting out coordinated and consistent action for government agencies and community groups to address the harm these substances can cause.

“This update of the National Drug Policy will build on the current approach adopted by government of controlling drug supply, reducing demand and helping people with alcohol and other drug problems. Importantly, the policy will allow for greater support to be provided to families and communities as well as those who misuse drugs and will do more for children living in households affected by alcohol and drugs”, says Mr McClay.

“While the Policy has gone a long way towards understanding how best to control substances that can cause harm if not consumed responsibly or are harmful regardless how they are used, I believe it is now timely to have input from the public about how the Policy can be more supportive in helping the wider community, families and individuals deal with problems caused by the misuse of these substances.

“Understanding the community’s views on what measures and priorities over the next 5-10 years should be in the updated National Drug Policy will enable the government to respond more effectively to those needs”, says Mr McClay.

Submissions will be open until 28 February 2014. The policy is expected to be finalised in mid-2014.
