Today, Education Minister Hekia Parata met with Christchurch’s mayor Hon Lianne Dalziel to brief her on the 10 year programme of restoring and renewing schools in greater Christchurch following the earthquakes.

“This was a great opportunity to go through the details of the Government’s investment in 115 greater Christchurch schools set out in the final Business Case released in November,” says Ms Parata.

That includes:

• Building 13 schools on new sites

• Rebuilding 10 schools on existing sites

• Fully redeveloping 34 schools and

• Moderately developing 58 schools

“This is a substantial investment and a significant milestone in education renewal in greater Christchurch and it was important for me to sit with the mayor to go through its specifics.

“It’s a great chance for us all to work together to help raise achievement for all children and young people in the Greater Christchurch education system,” says Ms Parata.
