Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed today’s release of a large amount of 2013 Census data by Statistics New Zealand.

“The information, which includes national highlights, regional data and information about Māori, will help shape how public money is spent over the next few years, including on health, education and transport. 

“Census information will continue to be published throughout 2014, including detailed data in February about greater Christchurch, which will be vital for making decisions on the rebuild,” Maurice Williamson says.

A new mapping tool, called StatsMaps, was also launched today to compare regions with the latest census information.  It provides data visualisation in a geographic format.

“StatsMaps is a smart mapping tool incorporating 2013 Census data to give a graphical representation of New Zealand, showing population and dwelling data in a format that allows the user to easily view changes and compare differences in regions,” Maurice Williamson says.
