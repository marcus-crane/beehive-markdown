Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson and Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia today announced terms of reference and timeframes have been set for a review into building access for disabled people.

The review will look at how the Building Act and Building Code’s provisions relating to access for people with disabilities are being implemented when buildings are first constructed or altered.

Maurice Williamson says it will include asking how well people understand the regulations and how they work together, particularly New Zealand Standard 4121 and the relevant Acceptable Solutions under the Building Code.

“We can have all the laws in the world but sometimes you have to stop and make sure they are having the right results.”

Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia says people with disabilities are saying buildings are still being built that are not accessible to them, which limits their opportunities for education, employment, and other ways to contribute to, and participate in, the community.

“The views of people who are living with disabilities will be well represented in the review, alongside government agencies and others with expertise. The Government will only get it right if we listen to those people most affected by barriers to access,” Mrs Turia says.

The review is being carried out by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and the Office for Disability Issues.

Government officials will be assisted in analysing more technical aspects of the review by an Access Reference Group. This group will include representatives from Blind Citizens NZ, Barrier Free New Zealand Trust, CCS Disability Action, Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind, and the Hearing Association of New Zealand, among others.

Recommendations from the review are due in the middle of 2014.
