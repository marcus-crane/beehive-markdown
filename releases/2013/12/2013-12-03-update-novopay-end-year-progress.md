Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the report on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Period 18 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 18, which was paid on the morning of 27 November, paid 89,785 people a total of $176.64 million.

The report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.079 per cent of staff across the country, eight staff were notified as not paid, 38 were overpaid, and 25 underpaid. Affected staff were from 62 schools or 2.53 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“Pay Period 18 was the 18th of the last 19 pay rounds below the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review team,” Mr Joyce says.

“The next big challenge is to ensure the next pay, Pay Period 19 – which covers the end of the school year – runs smoothly next week.

“The end of year/start of year is the most complex pay process in the school payroll calendar and caused significant problems last year and earlier this year.

“It will be a major test of Novopay and how well it has improved. The Education Ministry and Talent2 have put in a lot of effort and resources to ensure issues are being dealt with.

“While we are being cautious about how well this pay period will perform given the challenges of last year, indications so far are that good progress is being made and potential issues are being identified and resolved.”  

Mr Joyce says that school pay for Pay Period 20, which is due to be paid on Christmas Day, will be instead be paid on 21 December.

“Work on the start of the year is well underway and will continue over the next few weeks and Christmas holidays. Resolving the remaining outstanding leave balances will also be a priority,” Mr Joyce says.
