Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully is visiting French Polynesia this week.

“This visit is a chance to further strengthen New Zealand’s relationship with a Pacific neighbour and an important trading partner,” Mr McCully says.

“There are strong cultural and historical ties between our two countries as well as regular flows of visitors.”

During the visit Mr McCully will meet President Gaston Flosse and French High Commissioner Lionel Beffre.

Mr McCully will also visit renewable energy projects being utilised in the eco-tourism sector.

“New Zealand is a strong supporter of renewable energy in the Pacific. Innovative projects like these can help reduce the reliance on expensive imported fuels,“ Mr McCully says.
