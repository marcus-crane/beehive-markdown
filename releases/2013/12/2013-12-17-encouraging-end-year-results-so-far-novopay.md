Results from the first end of year pay for schools show the good progress that has been made this year in stabilising Novopay, Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce says.

The Government today released the report on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Period 19 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 19, which was the largest school pay of the year, paid 92,086 people a total of $221.89 million on the morning of 11 December.

The report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.19 per cent of staff across the country, 10 staff were notified as not paid, 56 were overpaid, and 106 underpaid. Affected staff were from 111 schools or 4.53 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“Pay Period 19 was the 19th of the last 20 pay rounds below the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review team,” Mr Joyce says.

“Along with the upcoming Pay Period 20, it covers the end of the school year – one of the most complex pay periods in the school payroll calendar – which caused significant problems last year.

“This was a big test of how much Novopay’s performance had improved and the positive result for end of year pay so far demonstrates the significant progress that has been made this year in improving the payroll system.

“Work is continuing to ensure any issues with Pay Period 20 are being identified and resolved.”

It is important to note that Pay Period 20 will be paid early, on this Saturday, because Christmas Day falls on the scheduled pay date next Wednesday.

“The next big challenge for the New Year will be ensuring that pay periods for the start of the year process run smoothly. The pay teams have done a lot of work on this process as well,” Mr Joyce says.

“While issues still remain, the Education Ministry and Talent2 have put in significant effort and resources into improving both the Novopay system and communication with schools and their representatives.

“Work to resolve other areas such as clearing the remaining bugs, some outstanding leave balance issues, and the accuracy of some information recorded on payslips, will continue in the New Year.”
