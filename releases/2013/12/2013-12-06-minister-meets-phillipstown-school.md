Education Minister Hekia Parata met with the Phillipstown Board of Trustees and Principal today to further discuss the on-going consultation process on the proposed merger with Woolston, following the High Court ruling on the judicial review brought by Phillipstown.

“It was a further opportunity to respond to Board’s questions about the timeframes around the consultation process. My overarching concern is to achieve certainty for the Phillipstown and Woolston school parents and communities. This is why I expect to announce my final decision in March 2014 which will be 18 months since consultation began,” says Ms Parata.

“I am following the High Court judgment which provided for continued consultation on one aspect of the proposed merger, namely, information about ‘costs’. The Ministry has been working closely with the school to ensure that it has all the information it requires to engage in this continued consultation, and that the information provided to the school is presented in a helpful and accessible way.

“The Ministry will continue to work with the school to help it engage a facilitator as soon as possible.

“Our Government is absolutely committed to the Christchurch communities and engagement with them. That’s why we’ve made it one of our four main priorities for this term and we have invested more than $1 billion over the next 10 years to restore and renew the education sector in greater Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri,” says Ms Parata.

“I want to resolve all the Board’s procedural issues now, so that the Phillipstown and Woolston communities can enjoy a complete break over Christmas, and we can continue the consultation as soon as the new school year begins.

“This will ensure a final decision in March 2014, and the certainty we all want,” says Ms Parata.
