Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today called for nominations for the new Game Animal Council, which is designed to give hunters a voice in the management of their recreation.

“We are looking for between nine and 11 members with knowledge and expertise covering all aspects associated with managing game animals. This includes recreational and commercial hunting, farming, forestry, Māori hunting interests, and nature conservation,” Dr Smith says.

“The establishment of the Game Animal Council is part of National’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future. It also illustrates National’s Bluegreen approach of getting sector groups, like recreational and commercial hunters, around the table to resolve competing interests.

“One of the first challenges for the Council will be developing an industry-led code of practice for aerially-assisted trophy hunting.”

Other key functions of the Council, established last month with the passing of the Game Animal Council Act, include advising and making recommendations to the Minister on hunting issues, providing information and education to the sector, promoting safety initiatives, conducting game animal research, and undertaking management functions for designated herds of special interest.

The Council is expected to be in place in the first half of next year. Nominations forms are available at [www.doc.govt.nz/gameanimalcouncil](http://www.doc.govt.nz/gameanimalcouncil). Nominations close on 27 January 2014.
