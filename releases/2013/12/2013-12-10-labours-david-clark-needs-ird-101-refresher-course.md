“Labour Revenue spokesman David Clark has issued possibly the worst press release in 50 years,” says Revenue Minister Todd McClay.

“David Clark’s overcooked and scattergun media statement today about supposed IT failings at Inland Revenue speaks volumes about his superficial understanding of Revenue issues”.

“He claims ‘the publication of inland Revenue’s annual performance measures is already one week overdue’.

“Wrong.

“Two documents fall within his description of ‘annual performance measures’. One, the ***Performance Improvement Framework*** was published on 24 October this year.

“In addition the Department’s Annual Report sets out IRD’s Key Performance Indicators which measure a range of IRD’s outputs and activities. That Report has been publicly available since 17 October this year. It also contains answers to other wild claims in his statement, for example ‘IRD failed to meet its own reduced target of answering three out of four customer phone calls’. In fact the target was for call centres to respond to 75% of customer calls within three minutes – IRD answered 73%, hardly an ‘embarrassing statistic’.

As Dr Clark heads off on his summer holiday, I have sent him a copy of the Annual Report and the ***Performance Improvement Framework*** document to read so in future he can engage in a sensible dialogue on Revenue issues,” says Mr McClay.
