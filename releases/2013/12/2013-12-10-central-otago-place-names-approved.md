Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced his decision to assign Lake Te Kōhua, Mount Tūwhakarōria and Tapuae-o-Uenuku / Hector Mountains as official names for three alpine features in Central Otago.

The decision confirms recommendations made by the New Zealand Geographic Board.

“Today’s announcement is the culmination of a process that began in 2011, when I rejected the place name proposal Te Kōhua Peak.

“I invited the Board to work with Ngāi Tahu and Central Otago District Council toward an agreed set of names for geographic features in the area. The names put forward were agreed to by the iwi and council,” Mr Williamson says.

Public consultation resulted in both supporting and objecting submissions for Lake Te Kōhua, Mount Tūwhakarōria and Tapuae-o-Uenuku / Hector Mountains.

“The Board did not uphold any of these objections, so it fell to me to make the final decisions on these three names.

“I note the chair of the Geographic Board, acting under delegation powers, has also agreed to assign a fourth name in the same area, Te Kārearea Peak. I support this course of action,” Maurice Williamson says.
