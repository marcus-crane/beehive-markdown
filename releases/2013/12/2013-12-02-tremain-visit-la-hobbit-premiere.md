Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain will travel to Los Angeles today to represent the Government at *The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug* world premiere.

“The world premiere in L.A provides the opportunity to build on the success of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and first of the Hobbit trilogy, and strengthen the New Zealand-Americas tourism relationship,”  says  Mr Tremain.

“The Government has actively supported the filming of *The Hobbit* movies in New Zealand because of the significant benefits to local industries, tourism, and creation of around 3000 jobs.

“The investment in marketing *The Hobbit Trilogy* is paying off with significantly increased visitor arrivals. The United States market is up 19 per cent and overall visitor numbers up an impressive ten per cent on last year.”

Tourism New Zealand will also maximise the media attention through a multi-media, innovative and interactive display titled “The Book of New Zealand.”

“In creating The Book of New Zealand, Tourism New Zealand aims to support international media and influencers to tell the wider story of New Zealand as a destination, a place of movie magic and of innovative and creative people. It will also provide a dramatic setting in which NZ Inc. will host key stakeholders and influencers,” says Mr Tremain.

“I will also meet officials and L.A based promoters of NZ tourism to look at enhancing our international profile as an innovative and creative nation, and as a great place to travel, make films and do business.”
