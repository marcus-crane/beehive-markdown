Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says with 2013 drawing to a close it is timely to acknowledge the amount of work that has gone into preparation for the full-scale construction of central Christchurch’s anchor projects.

“Over 2013 work on many of the 17 Anchor Projects has ramped up, starting with the necessary planning, proposals and contracting,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We can’t turn a single sod without getting the process in order, and with the number and size of projects we are dealing with that means a considerable amount of work has been done behind the scenes to get us to this point.

“Some projects, like the Avon River Precinct, are well underway.

“Collectively the Anchor Projects have gone to market seeking 13 Expressions of Interest and 33 Requests for Proposals, which have generated 251 responses and 44 separate successful tenders.

“In tandem there has been an intense purchasing programme to ensure the Crown secures the land it needs to deliver the anchor projects.

“To date we have 60.5 per cent of the total land area required, with three of the priority projects – the Bus Interchange, top of the East Frame and the Justice and Emergency Services precinct – having at least 92 per cent of the land in Crown ownership.”

Mr Brownlee says the development for the Metro Sports Facility is a good example of the work required to get to an anchor project to the start of construction.

“In the past 12 months, 67 per cent of the land area needed has been purchased.

“That equates to having agreements in place for 18 of the 32 properties, with negotiations underway for all but four of the remainder.

“Together the Crown and the Christchurch City Council have committed $217million to the project, for which the project management and quantity surveying is being completed by Davis Langdon.

“Design consultants Beca, Warren & Mahoney, Peddle Thorpe Melbourne and Boffa Miskell are developing a Master Plan for the facility, with EY working on the business case.

“By the middle of 2014 the entire site will be cleared, and the early works will start in the third quarter of the year.”

Mr Brownlee says the construction already underway on the various private projects across the city is a taster for what the skyline will look like in 2014.

“Cranes will dominate the city next year and for several years to come.

“The impact of the upcoming construction phase cannot be underestimated – the amount of labour, material and effort that the city will require will be incredible.

“By this time next year the change will be hard to believe, but now that so much of the ground work has been completed or is well underway, the more tangible, visible side to Christchurch’s redevelopment will become obvious.”
