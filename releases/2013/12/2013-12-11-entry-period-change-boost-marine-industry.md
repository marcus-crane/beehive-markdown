Customs Minister Maurice Williamson announced today that super-yachts, yachts and other small craft visiting New Zealand can now stay for up to two years without paying Customs charges.

All goods coming into New Zealand, including yachts, are subject to duty and GST. Visiting yachts and small craft are granted a temporary entry to exempt owners from paying these charges if they aren’t used commercially or sold, and depart the country within the time period.

“The Government has increased the temporary entry period from 12 to 24 months, which will be a boon for both yacht owners and our marine industry.

It’s expected a number of the more than 600 yachts that visit each year will take advantage of the additional time to get repairs and refits done.

“This change will also put New Zealand on an equal footing with many other countries,” Mr Williamson says.

Yacht owners who arrived in New Zealand after July can apply for an extension by emailing Customs their yacht and temporary entry details.
