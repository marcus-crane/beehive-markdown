Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss met with Chinese officials negotiating the China-NZ television co-production agreement in China today.

Negotiations began in 2010, when New Zealand and China signed a film-only co-production agreement. Mr Foss met with Vice Minister Nie Chen Xi in Beijing to discuss the benefits of television production collaboration between the two countries.

“New Zealand is now on track to become the first country to have signed a television co-production agreement with China,” says Mr Foss.

The Agreement will be a bilateral treaty between the two countries enabling television producers to work together on joint productions and access government subsidies available in both countries.

New Zealand’s relationship with China is of huge importance; this agreement will build on our strong relationship and allow greater access for New Zealand companies wanting to explore opportunities in China’s television production industry.

“Once concluded, this agreement will be the first television co-production agreement that China has signed with any country. It will provide the New Zealand screen industry with greater opportunities to work alongside their Chinese counterparts and learn how to produce content for a Chinese audience,” says Mr Foss.

Negotiations are expected to conclude with an agreement signed in 2014.
