Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman has announced that the new Chief of Defence Force will be Major General Tim Keating.

Currently the Vice Chief of Defence Force, Major General Keating will be promoted to Lieutenant General and will take over from Lieutenant General Rhys Jones on 1 February 2014 for a three year term.

“I congratulate Major General Keating on his new appointment as Chief of Defence Force,” says Dr Coleman. “I would also like to thank outgoing Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant General Jones for his service to New Zealand.

“Major General Keating is a strong, credible leader with 32 years of military experience serving New Zealand. He has extensive organisational management, leadership, and operational experience, and is well respected within the NZDF, and the international defence community.

“During his time as Vice Chief, he has ably supported the CDF in uniting the NZDF around a strategic, cohesive vision for a future Defence Force. He has been able to translate strategic ideas into practical and achievable plans, particularly for use on the frontline.”

Major General Keating joined the NZ Army in 1982. He has held various command positions, including Commanding Officer 1 NZSAS Group, Commandant Officer Cadet School, and Commander 2nd Land Force Group.

He deployed to Afghanistan as the Commander of the Provincial Reconstruction Team, Bamyan in 2005. He holds a Master of Strategic Studies from the US Army War College, Pennsylvania. In 2008 he was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Major General Keating was promoted to the role of Chief of Army in February 2011. In December 2012, he was appointed Vice Chief of Defence Force.
