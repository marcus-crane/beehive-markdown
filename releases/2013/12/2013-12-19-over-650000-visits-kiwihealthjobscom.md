Kiwi Health Jobs, a national job website advertising vacancies in public hospitals, has reached another milestone with over 650,000 visits since its launch in 2011.

Kiwi Health Jobs currently advertises clinical and non-clinical jobs for all district health boards (DHBs) and the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS).

“70 per cent of the 650,000 visits were from New Zealanders, with the remainder international visitors largely from the UK, Australia and the US,” says Mr Ryall.

“In the past two years, over 14,500 jobs have been advertised on Kiwi Health Jobs. Of these, around 4500 were nursing positions, 800 positions were for senior doctors, and over 2500 were for allied health positions such as physiotherapists and social workers,” says Mr Ryall.

Since 2008, there have been over 1300 extra doctors and over 3000 extra nurses employed in our public hospitals.

“Prior to the launch of Kiwi Health Jobs, New Zealand’s public health services did not have a single comprehensive site where health professionals seeking new jobs could go,” says Mr Ryall.

“Health professionals were previously expected to apply for jobs across multiple employers using a range of different systems, which I’m told could be difficult to operate.

“Kiwi Health Jobs now centralises job vacancies meaning health professionals only have to visit one easy-to-use site, and employers are also able to choose from a wider pool of candidates.

“Once again, I congratulate the DHBs and NZBS for this initiative. This is another great milestone as we move to improve the way we recruit staff throughout the health service,” says Mr Ryall.
