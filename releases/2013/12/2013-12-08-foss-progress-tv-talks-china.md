Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss will visit Beijing next week to progress a China-NZ television co-production agreement.

Mr Foss will be hosted by Minister of the State General Administration for Press, Publication, Radio and Television, Mr Cai Fuchao to discuss the television co-production agreement under negotiation.

“I look forward to meeting with my Chinese counterparts and exploring the opportunities available to both NZ and China in the television co-production space.

“Many innovative Kiwi businesses are already making their mark in China. I am aware of a number of exciting collaborations in China involving organisations such as NHNZ (Natural History New Zealand), Weta and Huhu Studios.

“There is enormous scope for Kiwi television production companies working in the Chinese market. With our already strong relationship, I look forward to formally progressing the negotiations. Once concluded, the agreement will be the first television co-production agreement China has with another country.

“There are also exciting opportunities for New Zealand to produce more television content for Chinese audiences as China’s global box office and television industry continues to expand.

The opportunities offered by digital convergence and the rise of digital platforms for screen content provide the perfect backdrop for formal collaboration between China and New Zealand,” says Mr Foss.

Mr Foss will also be visiting Guangzhou, a base for New Zealand manufacturing in China, and Guilin.
