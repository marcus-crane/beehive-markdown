Police Minister Anne Tolley and Customs Minister Maurice Williamson have praised their agencies following the largest ever ContacNT precursor drugs bust in New Zealand, in which over 330 kg of the Class B drug has been seized.

Police estimate it would have been used to produce up to 100 kg of methamphetamine, with a street value of $100 million.

$20 million of assets in property, cars and cash were also seized, and 24 arrests made, as 250 Police, OFCANZ and Customs officers today executed 40 search warrants in Auckland and Waikato.

“I want to thank every single officer who took part in this operation,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This has done serious damage to organised crime, and communities will be safer as a result.

“As well as getting drugs off the streets, it is a stark reminder to criminals that as well as serving time behind bars, they will also have to forfeit any profits from their crimes.”

Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says Operation Ghost will have a significant impact on reducing the supply of methamphetamine precursor chemicals into New Zealand.

“This Government is determined to cripple drug syndicates and put them out of business. Today’s historic drug bust shows these criminals that we will find them and we will dismantle their vile operations.”
