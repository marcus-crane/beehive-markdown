Formal, tertiary-level training is being developed for the country’s more than 180 civil defence controllers, Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye said today.

“When I have visited Civil Defence Emergency Management groups around New Zealand they have all raised with me their desire to have formalised training,” Ms Kaye says.

“These controllers play a critical role in helping keep our communities safe by managing our response to emergencies. If a state of local emergency is declared, then it is the controller who takes on the emergency powers set out in the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act.

“So I am pleased that funding has been approved to develop a controllers’ course and I have asked the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) to begin work on this as soon as possible.”

MCDEM will seek tenders from tertiary institutions experienced in providing emergency management courses to develop and deliver the course.

The course will form part of a wider controllers’ development programme that will cover a gap in specialist training for this role and serve as a critical part of their continuing professional development.

“Changes to the way the Tertiary Education Commission funds courses related to civil defence emergency management will also be beneficial to volunteers. For example, they will enable volunteers enrolled in individual courses to have that training funded by the Government without having to enrol in a full qualification,” Ms Kaye says.

“This means more choice for people to match their training to personal circumstances.

“These measures are focused on strengthening our civil defence system and ensuring the people at the front line in an emergency have the necessary skills.”
