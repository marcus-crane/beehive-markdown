Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the NZDF has officially received 40 new Medium-Heavy Operational Vehicles at a handover ceremony in Auckland today, just seven months after they were purchased.

“The new Rheinmetall-MAN military medium and heavy vehicles are a significant step up in capability for the NZDF, replacing the old Unimog and Mercedes trucks. They are designed for modern military operations and offer better mobility, better protection, enhanced technology, and greater capacity.

“By purchasing these trucks off the same production line as the UK, the Government has ensured value for money, and has achieved a fast delivery in record time.

“This project is a good example of smart and efficient procurement. The Government is keen to work closely with our international partners to identify future procurement opportunities which could achieve similar results.

“The NZDF’s continuous drive to deliver back office savings and efficiencies means that reinvestment into frontline capabilities like these new trucks can be made. The new trucks are part of a wider programme of equipment upgrades and investment into Navy, Army and Air Force frontline capabilities.”

A total of 194 trucks are being delivered at a cost of $113 million. This includes armour protection kits, weapons mounts, a range of specialist equipment, spare parts, logistic support arrangements, and training packages.

The NZDF expects to start training personnel in February-March 2014. The trucks will be rolled out to Army and Air Force bases and they will be fully introduced into service by the end of 2015.
