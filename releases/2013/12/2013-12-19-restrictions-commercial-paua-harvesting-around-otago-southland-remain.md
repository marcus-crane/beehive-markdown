Restrictions on commercial paua harvesting in areas around Otago and Southland will remain in place, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

“I’ve taken a precautionary approach and made the decision to retain the closures to commercial fishers. It’s clear these areas are greatly valued by recreational and customary fishers,” says Mr Guy.

The decision comes after Ministry for Primary Industries officials held extensive discussions with local iwi and recreational and commercial fishers.

“Following earlier consultation I decided that customary, recreational and commercial fishers should be given the opportunity to engage and reach agreement on any changes to the closed areas.

“I'm told there was a lot of goodwill and patience at the three cross sector meetings. They all came to the table and were fully engaged.

“Although no consensus was reached, they took the time to put their views and evidence forward. I want to thank everyone who took part in this process.

“One of the great things about living in New Zealand is that it is relatively easy to gather paua. These closed areas are popular with recreational fishers and are easily accessible.”

The paua industry had requested that some of the areas closed to commercial paua fishing in Otago and Southland be reopened as the original reasons for the restrictions are now redundant and are no longer required for food safety reasons.
