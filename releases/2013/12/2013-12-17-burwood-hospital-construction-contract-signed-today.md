Health Minister Tony Ryall was today joined by Prime Minister John Key to announce the main construction contract for Burwood Hospital’s multi-million dollar redevelopment has been signed today and construction will start in the New Year.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee, Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Amy Adams and Christchurch MP Nicky Wagner were also at today’s signing of the construction contract.

Leighs Cockram JV Ltd – a joint venture between Canterbury-based Leighs Construction and Australian company Cockram Corporation – has been awarded the contract. The company was shortlisted because of its local and overseas experience and reputation for delivering high quality, large-scale building projects.

“Redeveloping Burwood Hospital is a major step in Canterbury’s recovery and essential in assisting the region’s health services to recover from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes,” says Mr Ryall.

“We have set aside around $500 million from the Future Investment Fund to rebuild Burwood and Christchurch hospitals. The total cost of the project is expected to be more than $650 million. It is the largest and most complex building project in the history of New Zealand’s public health service.

Mr Ryall congratulated all those working on the project for their commitment in getting to the construction stage.

“Cabinet requested the project be fast tracked and I would like to thank everyone for their hard work to get to this point. The Christchurch City Council, in particular, has worked to very tight deadlines to ensure building can start in the New Year, and we thank them,” says Mr Ryall.

The new state-of–the-art health facility for Canterbury’s older people at Burwood will have three three-storey ward blocks and will accommodate up to 230 patients. It will also have clinical support services such as radiology and physiotherapy; an outpatient clinic that will cater for about 80,000 people each year; and general service spaces such as a kitchen.

Work on the building foundation for the 30,000 square metre project redevelopment has started. Construction of the buildings will start in the New Year, with the first ward blocks planned for completion in 2015.

The contract for the Christchurch Hospital will go out for tender next year.
