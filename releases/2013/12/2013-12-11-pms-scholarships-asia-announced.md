Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced that 89 outstanding New Zealand students have been selected to study at top education institutions in Asia next year as part of the inaugural Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia.

Mr Joyce says the scholarships, which cover study periods from six weeks to two years, will enable undergraduate and postgraduate students to gain a deeper understanding of Asia.

“New Zealand’s economic future is very tied in with our key trading partners in Asia,” Mr Joyce says. “We need more young Kiwis who have had the experience of spending some time studying in Asia, and can help strengthen our people-to-people links with those countries.

 

“The Prime Ministers Scholarships for Asia will allow some of our brightest young talents to experience life in key Asian cities. It will be an invaluable experience for them and for New Zealand.

“Each student will act as an ambassador for New Zealand, helping to promote the quality of our education system. Reciprocal study opportunities are an important aspect of strengthening the New Zealand-Asia education relationship.”

Successful scholarship recipients for this first round include a Bachelor of Business Science student from Auckland University of Technology studying at City University of Hong Kong for a year, and a Bachelor of Design (Hons) student from Massey University who will study for one semester at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

Funding for the Prime Minister's Scholarships for Asia of $9 million over five years was provided in Budget 2013 as part of the Government's Internationally Focused Growth Package. The scholarships are being managed by Education New Zealand, the lead agency for the promotion of international education. Applications for round two of the Prime Minister's Scholarships for Asia will open in January 2014.
