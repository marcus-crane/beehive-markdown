Corrections Minister Anne Tolley and Courts Minister Chester Borrows today welcomed the new audio visual link (AVL) connection linking New Plymouth Court with Whanganui Prison.

The new link is the first in a $27.8 million upgrade programme, which is expanding AVL links from the current four courts and four prisons to a total of 18 courts and 13 prisons by 2015.

Mrs Tolley says around 40,000 remand court appearances are made each year nationwide, and AVL will be used for more and more of those appearances as the rollout continues.

“These links mean that security and efficiency is enhanced,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Prisoners no longer have to leave prison to appear before a judge, meaning the safety risk to the public and staff created by the transporting of offenders is completely removed.”

“We’re putting a lot of effort into modernising the courts so that they provide services in ways that New Zealander’s expect in the 21st century,” Mr Borrows says. “AVL is a big part of that.”

“It also means a prisoner can be booked into a specific time slot rather than waiting in the holding cells for their case to be called, and this also enables the court to better manage its time and reduce delays.”

Mr Borrows says the installation of AVL takes a significant amount of time and effort and can be a logistical challenge.

“The team installed over 3,000 meters of cable in New Plymouth and had to work around the court sitting times, with much of the work being done outside normal business hours,” he says.

“But that sort of effort is worth it to improve the efficiency and safety of our courts.”

The AVL programme is a joint initiative of the Department of Corrections and the Ministry of Justice and is enabled by the Courts (Remote Participation) Act. AVL was first installed in the Auckland District Court in August 2010, followed by installations in Hamilton, Manukau, Christchurch, and at the Mason Clinic in Auckland.
