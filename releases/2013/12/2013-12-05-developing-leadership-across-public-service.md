State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new Government Chief Talent Officer will be appointed to drive a new public service talent and leadership programme.

“Developing our future public service leaders is crucial to maintaining an effective public service that is focused on delivering better public services for New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is important the public service offers an attractive career for young New Zealanders, and they get the career development and progression that makes the best use of their skills.

“The Government is taking a more considered approach to developing talent and leadership, and the creation of a new Chief Talent Officer will help to drive this forward across the public service. This complements the 80 key positions which have been identified as critical to strengthening the public service.”

The Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand’s public service is more effective and efficient, and that innovative ways of working are adopted.

“Results from the Better Public Services programme show the Government is making good progress on our challenging targets. Our public service is well regarded, the latest Kiwis Count survey shows Kiwis are increasingly satisfied with their public services. It is important we continue to deliver the services that New Zealanders expect,” says Dr Coleman.

Dr Coleman addressed over 100 recent graduates who are now working in 25 government agencies at today’s inaugural GradJam in Wellington. The event is an opportunity for recent graduates to network and to engage with public service and private sector leaders.
