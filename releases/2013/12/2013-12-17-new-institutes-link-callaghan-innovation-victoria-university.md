Two new specialist research institutes are being established at Victoria University of Wellington to take up some of the fundamental science work previously conducted by Callaghan Innovation, as part of Callaghan’s move to focus on more near-to-market research for Kiwi firms.

The Ferrier Research Institute will work with other organisations to understand the roles of complex carbohydrates in disease and human development. Working with New Zealand industry partners, the Ferrier Research Institute will develop drugs and related manufacturing technologies for treating cancer, microbial infections, and inflammatory illnesses.

The Robinson Research Institute will work with New Zealand manufacturers to engineer new products based on advances in superconductivity and other electromagnetic technologies.

Around 55 Callaghan Innovation staff will transfer to Victoria with the move although all will continue to be based at Callaghan Innovation’s Gracefield campus in Lower Hutt.

“This is a great move that will provide a win-win result for Victoria University and Callaghan Innovation,” Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce says.

“Victoria will greatly strengthen their capabilities in biomedical science and engineering. They will also gain some of New Zealand’s most renowned research scientists, who will strengthen the university’s research performance and ability to provide top quality research-led degrees for their students.”

“For Callaghan, the co-location of these dedicated new institutes will enable it to focus on near-to-market activities to meet the needs of Kiwi firms around the country, while allowing for continued close collaboration.” 

Callaghan Innovation and Victoria University will continue to work together closely and this development will strengthen the links between the two institutions.

The new research institutes will formally be established on January 6, 2014.
