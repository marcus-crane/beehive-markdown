Cabinet has approved new regulations for mining health and safety, as part of the Government’s response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy.

Labour Minister Simon Bridges says the new regulations will see significant changes to the health and safety regime of New Zealand’s mining industry.

“The regulations have been developed in consultation with independent New Zealand and Australian mining experts, as well as the New Zealand mining industry, and will bring New Zealand’s approach to mining health and safety into line with international best practice.”

“The regulations cover improved mining hazard and risk management, increased training, stronger worker participation systems and new emergency measures.

“These changes represent the creation of a comprehensive framework that will shape better behaviour and outcomes in mining workplaces,” says Mr Bridges.

The Health and Safety in Employment (Mining Operations and Quarrying Operations) Regulations 2013 will replace the Health and Safety in Employment (Mining Administration) Regulation 1996 and the Health and Safety in Employment (Mining-Underground) Regulations 1999.

The regulations will come into force on 16 December 2013, the same day the new stand-alone health and safety regulator, WorkSafe New Zealand, is up and running.

The associated changes to the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992, made through the Pike River Implementation legislation, will also come into force on the same day.
