Environment Minister Amy Adams and Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith have today announced the appointment of eight board members to the Auckland Unitary Plan hearings panel.

The Auckland Unitary Plan will be the first combined resource management plan for Auckland and will replace the regional policy statement, and the regional and district plans that Auckland Council inherited from the eight former councils of the Auckland region.

“It represents the largest planning exercise in the history of New Zealand, and will have significant implications for Auckland and New Zealand’s environmental and economic performance,” the Ministers say.

“The Auckland Unitary Plan hearings panel has an important role to play in shaping the future of Auckland.  The panel will hear submissions and make recommendations to the Auckland Council on the proposed plan.”

The panel members have expertise in a wide range of disciplines including law, economics, resource management planning, local government and Tikanga Māori.

The panel was appointed following consultation with Auckland Council and the Independent Maori Statutory Board. The Ministers thanked those entities for their constructive involvement in the process to select the panel members.

The panel will be chaired by David Kirkpatrick, a resource management barrister who has significant experience in consenting and planning. 

Mr Kirkpatrick has chaired high profile consent applications and has appeared in front of several Boards of Inquiry.

The other panel members are Des Morrison, Janet Crawford, Paula Hunter, John Kirikiri, Stuart Shepherd, Greg Hill and Peter Fuller.
