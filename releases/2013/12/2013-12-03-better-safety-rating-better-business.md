ACC Minister Judith Collins says a new Safety Star Rating Scheme (SSRS) is a good opportunity for ACC to encourage better practices with a tangible measure of progress.

“If you’re a top performing business, you’ll be recognised for it – and your customers will know about it too,” says Ms Collins.

ACC and WorkSafe New Zealand are working with businesses and workers’ representatives to develop a voluntary scheme that rates businesses’ workplace safety to improve long-lasting safety culture.

“ACC and WorkSafe are also looking to improve the connection between a business’ star rating and its brand, productivity and reputation as a respected supplier,” Ms Collins says.

“This is a good opportunity to make safety reputation a key factor in business-to-business transactions. Businesses with a good safety star rating will also be rewarded with levy discounts.

“The Scheme will clarify how a business’ workplace safety practices measure-up and how they can be brought up to standard under the new framework for workplace health and safety.

“It’s expected SSRS will initially be rolled out to the construction, forestry, and high hazard sectors and will eventually allow all firms in target sectors to join the Scheme.

“We want businesses to see that a serious approach to workplace safety is not just a matter of ‘good-will’, it’s a matter of good business,” says Ms Collins.

The SSRS is being developed jointly by ACC, WorkSafe New Zealand and MBIE to complement the Government’s new workplace safety framework. The Government is committed to a 25 per cent reduction in serious workplace injuries and fatalities by 2020. A proof-of-concept for the SSRS is scheduled for mid-2014.
