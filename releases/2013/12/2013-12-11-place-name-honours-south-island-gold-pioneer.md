Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced Headlong Peak, in Mount Aspiring National Park, is to be renamed Mount Tewha.

The decision confirms a recommendation made by the New Zealand Geographic Board. The move will see the name Headlong Peak assigned to its true location, an unnamed feature just north-west of the soon-to-be renamed Mount Tewha.

“Jack Tewha was the first person to discover gold in the Arrow River, which changed the history of the area from pastoral farming to a bustling mining community. Mount Tewha appropriately acknowledges this important history,” Mr Williamson says.

The proposal was submitted by a retired mountaineer who, along with his companions, claimed first ascent and naming rights of the mountain.

“After careful consideration, I have upheld the Geographic Board’s recommendations regarding Mount Tewha and the moving of Headlong Peak to its correct position.

“I’m also announcing today that a dual name is to be assigned to a feature overlooking Milford Track in Fiordland National Park recorded as Castle Mount. The feature was found to have had an existing Māori name, so it’s appropriate it have the dual name Pariroa / Castle Mount,” Mr Williamson says.
