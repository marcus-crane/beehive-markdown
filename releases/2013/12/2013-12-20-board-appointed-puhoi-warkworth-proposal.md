Environment Minister Amy Adams and Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith have today announced the members of an independent Board of Inquiry to consider a proposal for a new section of highway between Pūhoi and Warkworth.

The proposal was directed to a Board of Inquiry last month by Ms Adams and Dr Smith.

The application by the New Zealand Transport Agency relates to the construction, operation and maintenance of the Pūhoi to Warkworth section of the Ara Tūhono-Pūhoi to Wellsford Road of National Significance.

The proposal involves the Minister of Conservation because the proposal includes the coastal marine area, and has requests for coastal permits.

The five members of the Board of Inquiry are Hon John Priestley QC (Chairperson), independent hearings commissioners Alan Withy and David Chandler, environmental planning consultant Michael Parsonson, and resource management expert Bronwyn Hunt.

“The Board of Inquiry process will make sure anyone who wants to can have their say,” the Ministers say.

”The process also ensures there will be a robust decision within nine months after the proposal is publicly notified.”

The Board’s decision will be made independently of the Environmental Protection Authority and the Ministers.

The Board will meet before the end of the year and will issue a set of inquiry procedures which will include a timeline for the inquiry process.
