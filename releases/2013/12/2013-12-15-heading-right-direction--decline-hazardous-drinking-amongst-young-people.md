Associate Health Minister Todd McClay has welcomed the findings from recent health research that hazardous drinking among young people is on the decrease.

The figures, contained in data released by the Ministry of Health from the New Zealand Health Survey 2012/13, showed a reduction in hazardous drinking by young people from 35 per cent in 2006/07 to 25 per cent in 2011/12.

“While 25% per cent is still too high, I am pleased that the government’s policies in this area are having a positive impact, with a reduction of almost one third from five years ago. I expect that we will continue to see improvements around hazardous drinking as this government’s alcohol reform measures continue to take effect”, says Mr McClay.

“Hazardous drinking behaviour is linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including mental health issues. This government is committed to ensuring young people have the best opportunity possible to succeed in life and it is heartening to see this focus achieving positive outcomes”.

“As we enter the festive holiday season I know parents and, as this research shows, a growing number of young people will be concerned about the harm alcohol can do when not consumed responsibly. It would be a wonderful gift for all of us if this summer holiday can be remembered as a time when this downward trend in hazardous drinking not only continues but gets real momentum”, says Mr McClay.
