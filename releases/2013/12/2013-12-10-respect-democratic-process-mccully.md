Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully is calling on all parties to respect the democratic process in Thailand after the government announced an early election.

Thailand’s Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, yesterday dissolved parliament and called for an election following a month of often violent protests.

Mr McCully welcomed the move to ease tensions.

“The New Zealand Government has been concerned by the tensions in recent weeks and the risk of further bloodshed. Elections, expected to take place in February, demonstrate the Yingluck Government’s commitment to a peaceful resolution,” Mr McCully says.

“We commend the restraint shown by the Thai authorities and hope this will carry through to the elections.

“We believe the best way to determine the will of the Thai people is through the ballot box, and we urge all parties to see this as an opportunity to test their support.”

Thailand’s Constitution requires the election to be held 45-60 days from yesterday’s announcement.
