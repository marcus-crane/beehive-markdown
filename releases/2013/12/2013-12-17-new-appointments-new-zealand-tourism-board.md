Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Jacqui Spice, Norm Thompson, and Chris Parkin as members of the New Zealand Tourism Board.

Jacqui Spice is the founder and Director of Touch of Spice Ltd, a New Zealand luxury travel and concierge company.  Ms Spice’s extensive experience in the luxury tourism and hospitality markets will be immensely valuable to the Board as Tourism New Zealand increases its focus on high-value visitors.

Norm Thompson currently holds the role of Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Air New Zealand – a position he will be retiring from on 31 December 2013. Mr Thompson is the Deputy Chair of Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development and Vice Chair of Japan New Zealand Business Council, and was previously the Chairman of the Tourism Industry Association New Zealand.

Chris Parkin has spent more than 20 years in the hospitality industry and has considerable Board experience at both Director and Chair levels. He is currently the Chairman of Wellington Venues Ltd, a trustee of the Hannah Playhouse Trust, and the owner of the Museum Hotel in Wellington. Mr Parkin has previously held the positions of Wellington City Councillor, Director and Chairman of St James Trust, and Director of Te Papa.

“The depth of knowledge and experience of these candidates will make a significant contribution to the New Zealand Tourism Board,” says Mr Key.

These appointments are for three-year terms, with Ms Spice commencing her appointment on 27 January 2014 and Mr Thompson and Mr Parkin commencing their appointments on 11 April 2014.

Two of these positions are to replace Jennie Langley and Henry van Asch, who are departing the Board in April 2014 following completion of their second terms, and the third appointment is for a previously unfilled position on the Board.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms Langley and Mr van Asch for their commitment and service over their two terms with the Board,” says Mr Key.

The New Zealand Tourism Board (known as Tourism New Zealand) is a Crown entity, responsible for ensuring that New Zealand is effectively marketed as a visitor destination in order to maximise long-term benefits to New Zealand.
