Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart today for Bali Indonesia to attend the 9th World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference running from 3-6 December.

At the Conference Mr Groser will give his support to final efforts to achieve a package of new trade measures. “The continuing importance of the World Trade Organisation and its negotiating agenda to New Zealand should not be underestimated,” Mr Groser says.

“Although the Doha Round negotiations are not making headway, the success of a smaller package of trade facilitation, agriculture and development, and Least Developed Country issues can help restore confidence in the Geneva negotiating process. That’s badly needed if we’re to keep alive our hopes of an ultimate Doha Round outcome.

We are close to success on the Bali package and I support all efforts by the Director General and the key players to broker the final deal,” says Mr Groser.

Following Bali, Mr Groser will travel to Singapore to attend a ministerial meeting of the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations.
