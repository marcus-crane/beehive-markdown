Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced national guidelines for *Volunteer Coordination in CDEM* (civil defence emergency management) which provide advice to 16 regional CDEM groups.

“Volunteers provide valuable support to civil defence and are vital links to and within communities,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Canterbury earthquakes showed that CDEM needs to engage more effectively with community volunteers before, during and after an emergency. The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) has developed *Volunteer Coordination in CDEM* to help guide civil defence authorities in addressing this in future.

“This is another step in strengthening our civil defence emergency management.”

The CDEM and volunteering sectors have collaborated to produce the guidelines. Contributors include representatives from key volunteering organisations, including Volunteering New Zealand and the original Student Volunteer Army (now the Volunteer Army Foundation), and regional and local CDEM personnel.

The guidelines set out how CDEM Groups can work before, during, and after emergencies to engage well with volunteers, involve them in meaningful work, and recognise their contributions.

Information about working with CDEM-trained or spontaneous volunteers, individuals and groups is included. Role descriptions, checklists, templates, a registration form, and other documents that can be copied and adapted as required are included.

*Volunteer coordination in CDEM: Director’s Guideline for Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups* is available in the publications section of the MCDEM website [www.civildefence.govt.nz](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz)
