Commerce Minister Craig Foss has today released a discussion paper for public consultation on the Patents Act 2013.

“The paper focusses on regulations that will give effect to a more consistent, high quality patent examination process. The new legislation will strengthen the criteria for granting a patent to ensure genuine innovations, which are novel and useful, are protected,” says Mr Foss.

The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) is seeking feedback on proposed regulations, including:

- Fees payable for various services, requests and processes

<!--THE END-->

- Timeframes and procedures for submitting requests for examinations and re-examinations, third-party assertions and responding to reports issued by the Commissioner

<!--THE END-->

- Mandating online communication with the Commissioner of Patents

<!--THE END-->

- New powers for the Commissioner of Patents to control proceedings under the Act

<!--THE END-->

- New requirements relating to an address for service.

Although some parts of the Act are already in force, the Patents Act 2013 will commence fully on 13 September 2014.

“Aligning our patent laws more closely with international best practice is important for Kiwi businesses. Ingenuity and growth opportunities are thriving. A more robust IP framework gives innovators and exporters greater confidence when seeking IP protection overseas,” says Mr Foss.

“Other significant improvements are also being made to the patents framework in New Zealand. We recently approved a single application process and single examination process for New Zealand and Australian patent applications. There are no other intellectual property (IP) offices in the world that have pursued this kind of joined-up approach to patent applications and examinations,” says Mr Foss.

Submissions close 24 January 2014.
