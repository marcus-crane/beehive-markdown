Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the news of a planned visit to New Zealand by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in April next year.

“I am delighted New Zealand will have the opportunity to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who today confirmed they will visit Australia and New Zealand in April next year,” says Mr Key.

“It’s also anticipated Prince George will accompany his parents but a decision hasn’t been made on that yet and will be made in due course.”

Prince William has visited New Zealand four times in the past, most recently in March 2011 to attend the Christchurch Earthquake Memorial Service and to visit the families of the Pike River miners. This will be the Duchess of Cambridge’s first visit here.

Further details regarding next year’s visit, including dates and an itinerary, will be released by Kensington Palace next year.
