Education Minister Hekia Parata says Christchurch students just shy of achieving NCEA Level 2 will have the opportunity to gain the credits they need to get the qualification through a Ministry of Education-funded summer school.

The Ministry has contracted Hagley Community College to run a summer day school from 20 to 31 January 2014 and a summer evening school from 3 to 14 February 2014.

“Hagley Community College has a great and well established reputation as an education provider that’s willing to go over and above what’s required to get its young people to achieve,” says Ms Parata.

“I’m delighted that as part of this programme, Hagley will extend its summer school so that students from other schools in Christchurch can also take up this wonderful opportunity.”

There will be around 50 places available at the summer school through funding of $25,000.

Places at the summer school will be offered first to the eight Christchurch schools involved in the Ministry’s Achievement 2013-2017 initiative. This initiative sees the Ministry working with 129 secondary schools to identify young people at risk of not achieving NCEA Level 2 and supporting them to gain the qualification. Spaces will then be made available to students in a similar situation at other schools.

The learning programmes offered at the summer school will be finalised once all enrolments have been received and an analysis completed on the credits that students need to gain.  

“The summer school will identify each student’s current learning pathway and existing credits to work out what the best learning programme will be for them,” says Ms Parata.

“The Government’s education plan aims for five out of five students getting the qualifications they need to reach their potential. The 2012 NCEA results released earlier this year showed that 74.3 per cent of school leavers achieved NCEA Level 2 last year compared with 72.4 per cent in 2011. While this is good news, we can, and must, do better. This is a great example of “doing better” in action.”
