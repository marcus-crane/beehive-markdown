Today, Education Minister Hekia Parata hosted the NZSTA National Board Members and Regional Chairs to thank them for the support they have provided to school boards of trustees throughout the year.

“NZSTA has played an important part in supporting boards across the country to deliver on the Government’s relentless focus of raising student achievement,” says Ms Parata.

“Our Government in Budget 2013 invested $14.5 million to support Boards of Trustees. These are parents, grandparents and caregivers in our communities working hard for our local schools.

“The importance of good governance supporting excellent education leadership should not be underestimated.

“I want to reiterate my thanks to all those who stood for election, and all those who make up our school boards for the next 3 years,” says Ms Parata.

The Government also invested $2.4 million in a Connecting Communities initiative to include a parents’ tool kit and raising parent engagement..
