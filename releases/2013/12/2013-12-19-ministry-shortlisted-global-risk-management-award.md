Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye said today that the Ministry of Education’s Infrastructure Service team has been shortlisted for a global risk management award.

The London-based Institute of Risk Management, with members in over 100 countries, has shortlisted the Ministry of Education in the category of Delivering Value through Risk Management.

“I congratulate the Ministry on being short-listed for the Global Risk Awards 2014,” says Ms Parata.

“Short-listing for the Global Risk Awards recognises the Ministry’s role as a strategic asset manager on behalf of the Crown – a role Minister Kaye and I outlined in our release of the eight point plan to transform school property in September.”

Ms Kaye says the new plan will see the Ministry introduce new services to help schools minimise time spent on day-to-day property management and property projects. Key activities include investing in areas of growth and assisting schools with complex property issues.

“The Ministry manages a property portfolio with a replacement value of $21.9 billion. It administers around $500 million each year in capital investments and has overseen construction of 16 schools and numerous major property redevelopments in recent years. The addition of new services will further support school leaders and help maintain their focus on teaching and learning,” says Ms Kaye.

“The Government is confident that its significant level of investment in high quality education infrastructure is in good hands. Today’s announcement of an international short-listing for risk management endorses this view,” Ms Kaye says.

The winners of the Global Risk Awards 2014 will be announced in London on 27 February 2014.
