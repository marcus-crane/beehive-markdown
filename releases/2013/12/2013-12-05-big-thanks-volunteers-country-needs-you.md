Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today, on International Day of the Volunteer, praised the unpaid workforce who keep our nation going.

“This group freely donate their time and energy to keep our communities running. They are the backbone of our sports and social groups, search and rescue organisations, and the arts and cultural sector,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“New Zealanders like to muck-in and help-out. Around a third of adults contribute around 10 hours a month to their communities. That amounts to millions of hours given freely each year,” she says.

“It is an impressive contribution, which makes our communities and ultimately our country a better and safer place to live in.

“For over a million New Zealanders, today I am saying a big thank you! For millions more I encourage you to reflect on the amazing job this group does.

“Our volunteer workforce is just like any other workforce, they need to know that they are respected, valued and that they’re doing a good job.

“Volunteers also make a valuable economic contribution. They make up around 67 per cent of the community and voluntary sector workforce, and are estimated to contribute 2.3 per cent to our GPD,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Government supports volunteering through the Support for Volunteering Fund which distributes $502,000 each year to Volunteering New Zealand and the volunteer centres.

“I would also like to acknowledge Volunteering New Zealand who play a leading role in the volunteer sector and building volunteer capacity and capability within its member organisations,” says Mrs Goodhew.
