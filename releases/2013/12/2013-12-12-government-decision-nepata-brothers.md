Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government will not be paying further compensation to George and Damien Nepata.

“I know today’s decision will be disappointing for George and Damien Nepata,” says Dr Coleman.

“While I have huge sympathy for the brothers who were tragically injured in two separate incidents, it is clear there have been no substantive changes to their case since Cabinet considered the issue ten years ago.

“Their case has been thoroughly examined, with the brothers petitioning Parliament on two occasions. In 2003, the previous Government considered the Select Committee recommendations and decided it would not be appropriate to award ex-gratia payments to the brothers.

“The brothers received the appropriate entitlements under ACC legislation and they received their full legal entitlement to NZDF benefits.

“It is also not possible to distinguish between the situation of the Nepata brothers and numerous other people who have been injured in the service of New Zealand who have received appropriate compensation.”
