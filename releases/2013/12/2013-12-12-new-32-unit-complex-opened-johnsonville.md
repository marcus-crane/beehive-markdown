Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today officially opened 32 new two-bedroom Housing New Zealand homes in Johnsonville, Wellington.

“The opening of this new housing complex is great news for the 32 families just prior to Christmas. This project illustrates the Government’s commitment to providing good quality, warm, dry and safe homes for families with high housing needs,” Dr Smith says.

“Tenants in these new units include applicants from the waiting list and some who were relocated from earthquake-prone state housing complexes in the Wellington region.

“The 32 units meet demand in the Wellington region for two-bedroom homes, and are all fully insulated and double glazed with an outdoor deck area.

“This $10.7 million redevelopment has been one of a number of projects currently underway to help meet housing demand in the Wellington region. Last month I marked the beginning of construction for the Pomare mixed housing redevelopment in Lower Hutt, which will deliver around 150 new homes by the end of 2016.

“Macaulay Street is the latest step in Housing New Zealand’s record $2.9 billion three-year investment to deliver good quality state houses of the right size and in the right place for people with high housing needs.”
