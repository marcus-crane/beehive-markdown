Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced the reappointments of Dr Mark Berry as Chair and Sue Begg as Deputy Chair of the Commerce Commission.

“These reappointments will maintain continuity in the leadership of the Commerce Commission. This is particularly important as the Commission prepares to implement significant reforms in competition, consumer credit and consumer laws, as well as further progress a comprehensive regulatory work programme,” says Mr Foss.

The board of the Commerce Commission consists of six members, including the Chair, Deputy Chair and Telecommunications Commissioner. The board includes an associate member cross-appointed from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
