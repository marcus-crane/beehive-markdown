There is one name that crops up consistently throughout the Rebstock Inquiry, and that is Phil Goff, says State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman.

“It’s unbelievable that Mr Goff has come out and bagged the report. He needs to do some deep reflection,” says Dr Coleman.

“This inquiry is a timely reminder of the responsibility that public servants have to maintain the political neutrality of the public service.

“The report states that ‘the leak of Cabinet Committee papers and other documents about the MFAT change programme to the Opposition were unconscionable acts that undermined the reputation for political neutrality and integrity of the New Zealand State Services and the Government’s trust and confidence in public servants’.

“The facts are that Mr Goff is a central figure in this report, and is implicated in senior public servants compromising their political neutrality.

“What’s even worse is that Person X, the State Services Commission temp who is under ‘strong suspicion’ of leaking the Cabinet papers which ended up in Mr Goff’s hands, formerly worked for the Labour Party’s Research Unit.

“Mr Goff is running his reputation into the ground. Just two days ago he leaked confidential information from the Office of the Auditor-General briefing to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee. As a result he’s now subject to a Privileges Committee complaint. Earlier this year, he broke a coroner’s suppression order, and received a warning from Police.

“Frankly Mr Goff’s actions shows a consistent disrespect for the law, for Parliamentary processes and for political convention.”
