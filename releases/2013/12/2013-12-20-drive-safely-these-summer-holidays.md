Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is urging road users to travel safely over the summer holidays.

“We are on track to record the lowest annual road toll in 60 years, but we’re not there yet. We still have the busiest holiday period of the year to come so I urge everyone to be extra vigilant on the road this Christmas season,” Mr Woodhouse says.

As at 20 December there have been 245 fatalities due to road crashes for the year, this is 52 fewer than at the same time last year.

“The road safety message is being heard by more and more people through the government’s road safety strategy *Safer Journeys,* and by actions taken by road safety partners.

“Police will be working hard to ensure the roads are safer over the summer holidays and enforcing a lower speed threshold for December and January.

“Roads are busier at this time of year so it’s important that we all drive fresh, drive to the conditions, and allow plenty of time to reach our destination safely.”

During the 2012/2013 Christmas holiday period there were 6 fatal crashes and 237 reported injury crashes. Those crashes resulted in 6 deaths, 70 serious injuries and 283 minor injuries.

“This is the lowest recorded number of fatalities over the Christmas holiday period, but I hope this year we can do better.”

The official holiday period begins at 4pm Tuesday 24 December 2013 and ends at 6am on Friday 3 January 2014.

**Do what you can to make our roads safe:**

- plan ahead and allow plenty of time to get there to take the stress out of your trip
- be well rested before your journey, take regular breaks, and share the driving
- check your car — for example, good tyre tread and pressure will make for a safer vehicle and save money on petrol
- drive to the conditions because every road and every journey is different
- don’t drink and drive, don’t take drugs and drive
- don’t break the speed limit and drive to the conditions
- don’t use your cell phone while driving
- expect the unexpected — over the holidays the road environment can be more unpredictable
