Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced that the New Zealand Artificial Limb Board is changing its name.

“The organisation will now be known as the New Zealand Artificial Limb Service,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The name change comes after a review found that many people thought the organisation was only an administrative or governing body.

“This organisation is much more than that, every year over 4,300 New Zealand amputees are offered a range of services including the fitting and maintenance of artificial limbs, and rehabilitation support.

“I believe this name change acknowledges and highlights the incredibly varied and invaluable services offered by the New Zealand Artificial Limb Service,” says Mrs Goodhew.
