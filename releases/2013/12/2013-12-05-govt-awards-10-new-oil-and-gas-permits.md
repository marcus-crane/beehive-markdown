Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today announced the award of ten new oil and gas exploration permits as a result of Block Offer 2013.

The permits include five onshore permits across Taranaki and the East Coast and five offshore permits across the Reinga-Northland, Taranaki, and Great South-Canterbury Basins.

Collectively the permits represent approximately $62 million in committed expenditure on initial exploration which, if successful, could lead to further exploration work worth up to $720 million.

Mr Bridges says the results show New Zealand is firmly on the map as a key destination for investors in oil and gas exploration. 

“Block Offer 2013 attracted three new international companies to explore here, as well as expanded interest from companies already operating in New Zealand.” 

Permits were awarded to:

- Statoil Lambda Netherlands BV (new): One offshore Reinga-Northland permit
- Woodside Energy Holdings (new) and New Zealand Oil & Gas: Two offshore permits, Taranaki and Great South Basin South-Canterbury
- New Zealand Oil & Gas: One offshore Great South Basin South-Canterbury permit
- Octanex NZ: One offshore Taranaki permit
- AWE NZ & Mitsui: One onshore Taranaki permit
- TAG Oil NZ: One onshore Taranaki permit
- Eastern Petroleum & East West Petroleum: One onshore East Coast permit
- Petrochem: One onshore Taranaki permit
- Mont D’Or (new): One onshore East Coast permit

“The award of exploration permits today is another important step toward unlocking New Zealand’s oil and gas potential, both on and offshore,” says Mr Bridges.

“Today’s announcement comes as we kick off one of the country’s largest oil and gas exploration seasons, with 13 wells being drilled offshore and around 30 onshore.  On conservative estimates the industry is expected to spend $600 million to $755 million.

“The Government is committed to developing our oil, gas and mineral resources in a sensible, safe and environmentally responsible way.  Block Offer 2013 is delivering on that,” Mr Bridges says.
