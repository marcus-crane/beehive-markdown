Minister of Science and Innovation Steven Joyce today announced two appointments to the Science Board – the Board responsible for the allocation of funding used predominantly by research organisations for science, technology, research, and related activities.

“Professor Adam Jaffe and Professor Janis Swan have been appointed for a term of three years, bringing the Board’s membership to eight. Their skills and experience will assist the Board to make funding decisions on the National Science Challenges, which will require a long-term and strategic view of the Government’s investment,” Mr Joyce says.

“High-quality research creates economic, social and environmental benefits for New Zealand. Professors Jaffe and Swan are strong additions to the Board. Their wide breadth of experience, knowledge and achievements, and their expertise will be valuable in making key strategic decisions.”

Professor Jaffe has been director at Motu Economic and Public Policy Research since May 2013. He was previously Professor of Economics at Brandeis University in the United States, and his expertise is in evaluating and quantifying the social and economic impacts of research.

 

Professor Swan is Associate Dean of Engineering and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Waikato. She has received several distinctions and awards in recognition of her expertise in the engineering field. Her experience at the Meat Industry Research Association of NZ and her academic research interests have earned her an understanding of the application of scientific research and of the requirements of end users of research.

Current Board members Dr Wendy Nelson and Dr William Rolleston have been reappointed for a further three years.

Dr Nelson is a Principal Scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and Dr Rolleston is a founding shareholder and director for South Pacific Sera, which produces animal blood products and vaccines for the biotechnology sector.

The remaining Board members are Dr John Hay (chair), Professor Charles Royal, Professor Warren Tate and Professor David Williams.
