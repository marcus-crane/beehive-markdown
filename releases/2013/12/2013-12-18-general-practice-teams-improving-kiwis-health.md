Thanks to the hard work and dedication of general practice teams, more New Zealanders are getting checks for diabetes and heart disease, more babies are being immunised, and more people are getting help to quit smoking.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the latest national primary health care target results released today, show general practice teams are focused on improving the health of New Zealanders.

“28 out of 36 Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) have achieved or exceed the new immunisation target of 90 per cent,” says Mr Ryall.

“Over 290,000 smokers seen by their GP over the past 12 months have been offered advice and support to quit.

“And 69 per cent of eligible New Zealanders have had their heart and diabetes risk checked – a two per cent increase this quarter.

“While there is still more work to do to achieve these important preventative health targets, significant progress has been made since this government introduced the national health targets.

“A number of PHOs will need to lift their performance and I have asked DHBs to more actively support poor performing PHOs,” says Mr Ryall.

PHOs are funded by district health boards to provide health care services through general practices to patients who are registered with them.

A copy of the national primary health care target results are available on the Ministry of Health website:
