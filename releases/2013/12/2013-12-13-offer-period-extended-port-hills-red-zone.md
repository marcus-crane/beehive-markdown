Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has announced an extension for consideration of the Crown’s offer for eligible property owners in the Port Hills residential red zone.

Eligible red zone property owners will now have until 31 August 2014, instead of 31 March 2014, to decide whether to accept the Crown’s offer to purchase properties deemed to have an unacceptable level of life risk from rock roll and cliff collapse.

“This extension follows a previous extension from 31 January 2014 to 31 March 2014, in recognition of the delays in announcing the result of a review of zoning in the Port Hills until last week,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We recognised earlier on that these delays – partly as a result of the Quake Outcasts judgment in the High Court – had been very tough on the affected property owners.

“It’s now become clear that we need to give those red zoned property owners – particularly those whose properties have gone red in the review – more time in which to carefully consider the Crown’s offer, get all the advice they need, and to make an informed decision.”

As a result of the review announced last week, the zoning changed for 270 properties – with 237 properties across 96 addresses going from green to red, and 33 properties going from red to green.  This brings the total number of red zone properties in the Port Hills to 714.

Red zoned properties owned by the Crown or the Christchurch City Council are ineligible for the Crown offer.

“The review panel led by Dr Keith Turner considered a large amount of information in reaching its recommendations and the property owners can be confident the final decisions were thorough.

“All of the decisions were based on the safety of those property owners and their families,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) has sent forms to all of the eligible red zone property owners to seek their consent to receive a Crown offer.

“I expect the first of the offer letters to property owners will be sent in the next week.”

At this time offers will not be made to the owners of uninsured properties, vacant land and commercial properties, following the recent Court of Appeal judgment.  The Crown is in the process of reviewing the offer process for these properties to ensure any future offers are made in accordance with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act.

Affected property owners who have any further queries can contact the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority on 0800 RING CERA or at [info@cera.govt.nz](mailto:info@cera.govt.nz).
