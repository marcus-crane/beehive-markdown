A new Conservation Park on Great Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf is being formally notified for nationwide submissions.

“The Department of Conservation has reported to me on this new park proposal put forward by Auckland Central MP Nikki Kaye. This discussion document provides DOC’s analysis on the proposal and is an opportunity for the public to have a say,” Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“This is a significant proposal that would upgrade 12,100 hectares of stewardship land into a Conservation Park. This would make it the largest DOC Park in Auckland and similar in size to the Hunua and Waitakere Rangers Regional Parks managed by the Auckland Council.

“I am supportive of this proposal. It is consistent with the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment’s recommendation that DOC review the status of stewardship land. The proposed park contains the largest area of forest in New Zealand that is free of possums and mustelids like stoats that pose such a high risk to our native birds.

“The success of this proposed new Conservation Park on Great Barrier Island requires that we get the detail right. I encourage the public to read the discussion paper and ensure they have their say on the proposed boundaries, name and approach to the new park’s management.

“Submissions close on Friday 28 February 2014 and hearings will take place in March and April. I will make a decision on the proposal after I receive a final report from the Department.”
