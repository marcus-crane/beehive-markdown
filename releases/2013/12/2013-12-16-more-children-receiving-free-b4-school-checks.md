Record numbers of kiwi kids received a free B4 School Check (B4SC) from July to November this year – over 2700 more children than over the same period last year.

“More children than ever before are now receiving B4SCs to help identify any health or learning difficulties before  they start school,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“We know that pre-school children are at a crucial stage of their development. By getting in early, and identifying how kids are doing before they enter school, we can make sure that they get the help they need to participate to their full ability.

“The B4SC also gives parents a chance to discuss their child’s health and development with a nurse,” says Mr Ryall. 

The checks usually take between 45-60 minutes and cover things like vision and hearing tests. Parents are encouraged to be involved in the process and help fill out questionnaires about their child’s development and behaviour.

“The government has set a target of getting 90 per cent of eligible children checked. DHBs are on track to achieve this target – with three quarters of DHBs already meeting or exceeding the targeted number of checks for the year so far,” says Mr Ryall.
