The managed wind-down of Learning Media has been completed, Finance Minister Bill English and Education Minister Hekia Parata say.

“The Learning Media board has managed the wind down in a way that provided certainty of provision for publications such as the School Journal, as well as ensuring staff were treated fairly,” Mr English says.

Ms Parata says she is, “pleased that a New Zealand owned provider, Lift Education, has taken on the publication of the School Journal and Ready to Read series, and that other providers have picked up the other resources.”

Around $4 million of Government support has been provided to Learning Media since early September to enable an orderly wind-down to occur.

“Government contributions have meant all staff have been paid their entitlements in full,” Ms Parata says.

“The board and the Ministry of Education have worked hard to provide transitions for staff, with many moving to the new suppliers and some also moving to the Ministry.”

As a company in its own right, Learning Media’s debts were not guaranteed by the Government.

“Unfortunately, the company’s financial situation meant that its largest creditors, including its bank, have not been paid in full,” Mr English says.

“Learning Media highlights the risks the Government and taxpayers take in owning commercial assets.”
