An embarrassing middle-aged Dad trying to impress his teenager’s friends by supplying them alcohol features in a new publicity campaign to remind people of new laws about supplying alcohol to under-18 year olds.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the campaign, developed by the Health Promotion Agency (HPA), relates to law changes this month around social supply of alcohol to under-18s.

“From December 18, it will be illegal to supply alcohol to anyone under the age of 18 unless you are their parent or legal guardian or have express consent from their parent or legal guardian,” Ms Collins says. 

“Express consent could include a personal conversation, an email or a text message that you have good reason to believe is genuine. And if alcohol is provided, it must be done responsibly – for example, with food supplied and adequate supervision. The penalty for breaching the law is a fine of up to $2000.

“The express permission and responsible supply rules send a strong message to young people and parents, as well as providing a tool for Police to intervene in unsupervised or poorly supervised parties,” Ms Collins says.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says setting good examples for our children and providing a safe environment for the younger generation is crucial to help drive change in New Zealand’s drinking culture.

“The Government has delivered a wide range of measures to reduce alcohol-related harm. But change can’t be achieved through legislation alone. We’re all responsible for reducing alcohol-related harm.

“A major aim of the advertising is to inform New Zealanders about the new law. However, we also want to ensure parents have information and support to help them manage alcohol-related issues with their teens,” Mr Ryall says.

The *Don’t be a ‘cool’ Dad* publicity campaign debuts on television today and runs until 31 December. In addition to TV advertising, the campaign includes radio, online banners, and information sheets at more than 1,000 off-licences nationwide.
