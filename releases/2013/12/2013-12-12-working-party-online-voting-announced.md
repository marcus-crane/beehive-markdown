Local Government Minister Chris Tremain today announced that the Department of Internal Affairs has appointed a ten-person working party to look at the feasibility of online voting.

“The group includes a range of experts, including people with experience in IT, electoral processes and local government.  They will consider the advantages and difficulties associated with online voting and explore the possibility of using it for the 2016 local body elections.   But this is conditional on there being a significant and successful trial prior to 2016,” says Mr Tremain.

“Many people now are using smart phones and the internet for all manner of transactions – online voting should be one of them.  However we need to understand the risks, benefits and costs before we make any final decision.  Accessibility for all voters is a critical consideration in any move forward.

“The group includes technology consultants, a blogger, local body politicians and public servants to ensure independent strategic advice on all the issues. The Chair, Danny Mollan, will be remunerated for his work on the working party but all the other members are giving their time for free.”

The other working party members are: Darryl Griffin, David Farrar, David Pannett, Jan Ziegler-Peri, Jordan Carter, Lorraine Vincent, Nick Leggett, Paul Matthews and Anne Shaw.
