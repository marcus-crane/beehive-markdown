Revenue Minister Todd McClay announced today that New Zealand Company Assurity Consulting Limited has been awarded a contract worth up to $30 million as part of the Business Transformation process. Assurity will be the preferred testing provider resulting from an open tender by Inland Revenue on the Government electronic Tender Service website.

Assurity Consulting Limited, an IT consulting business with offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch that specialises in software testing, will support Inland Revenue’s existing testing services. Software testing is a quality assurance mechanism that provides an objective and independent review of software used by Inland Revenue to meet specified business requirements.

“This is a substantial contract for Assurity worth up to $30 million. The company was selected based on the total service they offer and their demonstrated capability in response to Inland Revenue’s testing requirements and their ability to provide these services within a specified budget”, says Todd McClay.

“Letting this contract is an important step forward in Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme as it will significantly contribute to the quality, speed, productivity and integrity of the processes that will drive Business Transformation. It is also gratifying that a New Zealand company has the capacity and necessary skills to meet Inland Revenue’s demanding requirements involved in this contract.”

“Transformation is a major change programme that will occur over a number of years and like this contract won by Assurity, there will be many opportunities for New Zealand IT companies to work and support Inland Revenue through the transformation process.” says Mr McClay.
