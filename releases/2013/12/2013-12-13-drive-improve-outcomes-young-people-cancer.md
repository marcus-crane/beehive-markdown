Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the government is investing more funding into an initiative to ensure young people with cancer get the support and care they need.

“The Government has allocated an extra $650,000 over two years to help improve adolescent and young adult cancer services,” says Mr Ryall.

“Young people in the 12 to 24 year age group have unique cancer treatment needs. Evidence shows that when young people receive care that is delivered in a way that’s age appropriate, they do much better.

“Currently our survival rates for young people five years after being diagnosed with cancer are below international comparisons.

“This extra funding will help us to understand why our rates are different and help us to improve cancer services for young people.

“The work will be driven by a clinical network similar to the Child Cancer Network, which has been successful in improving child cancer services.

“The Ministry of Health will be calling for adolescent and young adult cancer experts to join this clinical network in the new year,” says Mr Ryall.
