A playground based on author Margaret Mahy’s work has taken out one of the top prizes in the BNZ Amazing Place playground design competition run by the Christchurch Central Development Unit, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has announced.

“I’m also pleased to announce the playground based on the inspiration of Christchurch school children will also bear Margaret Mahy’s name,” Mr Brownlee says.

Prime Minister John Key personally congratulated the playground competition winners today in Christchurch and says honouring the late author by naming the city’s new playground after her was fitting.

The Margaret Mahy playground will be built in the central city’s East Frame, which is one of the anchor projects in the Christchurch Central Development Unit’s redevelopment of Christchurch.

It was designed by four Year 6 students from Selwyn House School and Mr Brownlee says he is not surprised that it took the judge’s attention.

“I’m really impressed by the amount of work that has gone in to all the entries.

“In particular, this design has given a lot of thought to how children and their families can play together, creating a fun and safe environment so that all children, including those with special needs can make the most of this Amazing Place.”

Over 6000 Canterbury school children took part in the competition and judges had almost 300 individual entries to choose from.

Designers working with the CCDU will now look at ways ideas from the winning entries can be incorporated into the final design for the playground.
