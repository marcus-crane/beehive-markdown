Prime Minister John Key has announced the date for a by-election in Ikaroa-Rāwhiti will be Saturday 29 June 2013.

The by-election follows the death of MP Parekura Horomia.

“I have been advised that, since the vacancy arising from Mr Horomia’s death has now been gazetted, it is appropriate to set a date for the by-election,” says Mr Key.

“The by-election Writ day will be Wednesday 29 May. Candidate nominations must be received by midday on Wednesday 5 June and the last day for the return of the Writ will be Thursday 18 July.”
