Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss welcomes today’s launch of the NZ On Air- funded innovative music website – [audioculture.co.nz](http://audioculture.co.nz)

“AudioCulture is a fantastic new site that documents New Zealand music history, video clips and digital collections. I am delighted that it will connect New Zealanders and music fans around the globe with the stories behind our rich variety of sounds,” says Mr Foss.

AudioCulture is run by the Digital Media Trust, which is also responsible for the NZ On Air- funded NZ On Screen site. NZ On Screen will provide complementary connections to film footage of New Zealand music videos. Minister Foss says the new site will be a great way to promote New Zealand music.

AudioCulture focuses on our popular music history. It follows in the footsteps of The Audience, also funded by NZ On Air, to promote and develop the discovery of unreleased new New Zealand music.

“Digital platforms are increasingly important. It's fantastic to see online sites helping improve accessibility to Kiwi content both here and abroad,” says Mr Foss.
