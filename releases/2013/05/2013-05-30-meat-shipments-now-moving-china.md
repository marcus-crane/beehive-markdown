Containers of New Zealand meat are now moving off the wharves and into the Chinese market, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has confirmed today.

“I’ve spoken to meat companies this morning who have confirmed that the first shipments have been collected from the wharf. It’s positive news that the backlog has now begun clearing.

“AQSIQ are now progressively working their way through the remaining reissued certificates as a priority.

“Ports are being authorised to release these further consignments, so it is now up to importers and agents to begin collecting their shipments.

“Clearing the backlog will take some time, but it’s positive that New Zealand meat is now entering the Chinese market again.

“Senior New Zealand officials are working with Chinese authorities at AQSIQ on options for new meat export certifications. I’m confident that AQSIQ will work constructively with us on progressing this.

“I want to thank the meat industry for their patience and support in working through this delay.”
