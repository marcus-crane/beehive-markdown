The Government has set aside $1.2 million in Budget 2013 for the development of Community Hubs and Marae CBD that will deliver social services to communities, Associate Social Development Minister Tariana Turia says.

“Marae are at the centre of much of our activity as Māori and have the capacity to support our cultural activities and ensure our tikanga is upheld.

“Many marae over the years have been transformed into classrooms for programmes ranging from language and culture, land based studies, tourism and employment training, health services and local activities.

“As well, many of our local community centre, churches and education centres have also been the hub for community functions and activities. We should invest in this cultural capacity.

“This funding will expand on the good work achieved and utilise existing structures to maximise the inherent potential each marae or community group currently holds as the hub for our communities and whānau.

“For example the project will encourage marae-based learning and initiatives to promote whānau literacy, including financial literacy and health literacy which will also boost iwi engagement in student achievement.

“Other initiatives could include enhancing tourism opportunities and employment training and marae-based health clinics as preferred sites of well-being and service delivery to support whānau,” Mrs Turia says.
