Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced that the funding round for grants to be distributed by the 36 Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS) committees opens tomorrow.

“COGS is a community-driven, government-funded scheme that provides grants to non-profit organisations and groups that deliver community-based social services,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“Last year 4369 COGS grants were allocated to community organisations across New Zealand.

“COGS committees have a total of $12.5 million to distribute throughout New Zealand. Approximately 260 volunteer committee members that are elected by local communities assess applications and make decisions based on local funding needs and priorities.”

Local funding priorities were set after consulting communities at public meetings held earlier this year. Applicants can view each committee's local priorities when they apply online at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz). The local priorities will be displayed when responding to questions in the online application.

COGS applications must be submitted by Wednesday 31 July 2013. Applicants are encouraged to apply online, ideally well before the closing date.

Community Advisors in Department of Internal Affairs offices across the country are available to help with applications.

Please phone 0800 824 824 between 8.00am and 5.00pm Monday to Friday, or email to [community.matters@dia.govt.nz](mailto:community.matters@dia.govt.nz)
