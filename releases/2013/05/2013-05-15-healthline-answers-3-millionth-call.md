Health Minister Tony Ryall has congratulated Healthline on its milestone today of taking its three millionth call.

The three millionth caller was a Canterbury woman who received advice on how to manage her symptoms at home from the Healthline nurse. The nurse who took the call was working from her home at Waipu near Whangarei.

“The free 24-hour health advice phone line continues to be extremely popular with New Zealanders,” says Mr Ryall.

“In the past three months Healthline has answered nearly 95,000 calls – 77 per cent of these calls were people ringing to discuss symptoms they or a family member was experiencing, such as a fever and vomiting.

“Often people need advice and reassurance when someone is sick or hurt, and it’s a great relief to be able to pick up the phone any time of the day or night and speak to a health professional.

“The majority of the calls to Healthline are received outside business hours, with weekends and Mondays being the busiest times.

The National led Government is investing an extra $6 million over the next four years to boost telephone advice services so even more New Zealanders can speak with a nurse anytime of the day.

People can phone Healthline on 0800 611 116 from landlines or cellphones at any time of the day or night to receive, free, confidential health advice from experienced registered nurses.
