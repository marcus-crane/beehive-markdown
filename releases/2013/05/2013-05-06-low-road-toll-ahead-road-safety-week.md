Road Safety Week starts today and runs until 12 May, and Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is encouraging all road users to think about safe driving and to take extra care around cyclists and pedestrians.

Road Safety Week NZ is promoted by the road safety charity BRAKE with the support of government agencies, and coincides with United Nations Global Road Safety Week that this year is dedicated to pedestrian safety.

“It’s great to see government agencies working with the community to promote road safety, and Road Safety Week is a good example.”

Mr Woodhouse says Road Safety Week also complements the good work the government is doing through the Safer Journeys Action Plan, which is seeing good results.

“Road Safety Week comes as the 2013 road toll is tracking well against previous years. The toll for the calendar year to 1 May stands at 82, the lowest since records began.

“This is a reduction of about 40 per cent over the last five years, and is less than a third of the number of fatalities (277) we had 25 years ago.

“The over-all trend is very positive, but we cannot afford to be complacent. A low road toll is of cold comfort to those who experience the loss of a loved one.

“I ask drivers to be extra vigilant around schools as students return to classes today to begin the new term. Cyclists and pedestrians should also take extra care, especially after dark.”
