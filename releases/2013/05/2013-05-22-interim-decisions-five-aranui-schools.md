Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced the interim decisions for the five Aranui schools in greater Christchurch affected by the Government’s Education Renewal Plans.

“The Government is absolutely committed to rebuilding Christchurch – that’s why we are investing $1 billion into restoring and renewing the education sector in Canterbury over the next 10 years,” Ms Parata says.

“Greater Christchurch will have one of the most modern schooling networks in the country that will serve communities for many years to come, and help each and every child get a great education.

“We have listened to parents and the community and I thank the Aranui community for their participation in the process, and the work each school put into their submission.’’

The interim decision is that:

- A Year 1-13 Campus should be built on the current Aranui High School site.

<!--THE END-->

- Four schools – Aranui High School, Wainoni Primary, Aranui Primary and Avondale Primary – should close in January 2017.

<!--THE END-->

- Chisnallwood Intermediate should remain open, and continue to operate as normal on its current site, with a review in 2020, once all other changes have bedded in.

“The proposal for a new campus originally included all five schools in the Aranui area.  In reviewing the submissions and undertaking further analysis – with a focus on ensuring an exciting brand new education concept for Aranui children – we can achieve this and maintain a strong intermediate option in Chisnallwood.  

“Two thirds of the children that attend Chisnallwood are from outside the Aranui area.

“My interim decision is that Chisnallwood Intermediate should remain open on its current site and will be reviewed in 2020 after the new campus and other changes in the network are operating,” says Ms Parata.

“The plan is for the new Year 1-13 campus to open in January 2017 which is also when the four schools are proposed to close.”  

The Aranui schools had an extended consultation timeframe until March 7..

“The single site approach means several schools of different levels operating on one site, with the opportunity to share resources. It is a model that operates successfully elsewhere in New Zealand, and provides continuity for students – and an opportunity to provide other services on site as well,’’ says Ms Parata.

Further consultation will now take place with the community on these interim decisions, and on the structure of the single site campus and the community facilities that could also be included such as a library, sports facilities, health and other social services.

“In making these interim decisions, I am mindful families in greater Christchurch have already been through a lot and I hope that today’s announcement will provide some certainty for this stage of the process.’’

The Aranui schools will now have six weeks to provide further feedback on the interim decision until 3 July 2013. 

A final decision is expected in September.
