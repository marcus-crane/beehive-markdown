The Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre in Auckland is to be rebuilt following a $5.5 million Government commitment of operating expenditure over the next four years towards the cost as part of Budget 2013.

Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse says the Mangere centre has played a crucial role in helping refugees adapt to their new life in New Zealand, but many of the ageing buildings are beyond repair and need to be replaced.

“The original facilities at Mangere were built during World War II. They have been left to deteriorate in recent years and something needed to be done,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The current facility accommodates up to 160 individuals. The new facility will be designed to accommodate up to 192 beds, and will include provision to accommodate up to 300 individuals in the event of a mass arrival.

“The decision to rebuild the centre demonstrates the Government’s strong commitment to preparing refugees for New Zealand life and their move into the community,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The government is contracting with the private sector to construct new facilities with the government leasing the buildings back over the long term. The new funding is part of the costs to lease and maintain the new buildings.

Mr Woodhouse says he hopes the arrangement will see new and upgraded buildings worth around $15 million at the refugee centre by the end of 2014. The new facility will be built in stages to enable “business as usual” operations to continue during the construction period.

The Government reaffirmed the six week reception programme for new Quota refugees at Mangere in the whole-of-government Refugee Resettlement Strategy launched last December.

The Strategy is aimed at delivering better outcomes for refugees settling in New Zealand, including increasing the number of refugees in paid employment and increasing their educational achievement.

“We have an enviable reputation internationally for our work in resettling refugees from the world’s trouble spots and I’m very pleased that we are now in a position to rebuild the Mangere facility,” Mr Woodhouse says.
