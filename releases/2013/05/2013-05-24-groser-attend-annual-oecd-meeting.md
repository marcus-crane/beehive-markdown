Trade Minister Tim Groser will represent New Zealand at the OECD’s annual Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) and Forum in Paris from 27 to 30 May. 

“The theme for this year’s meeting is ‘*It’s all about people: Jobs, Equality and Trust’*,” says Mr Groser. 

“The Ministerial Council Meeting provides the opportunity to discuss the big challenges the world faces today such as high unemployment, inequality, and low economic growth in many countries.  Trade is an important mechanism to help achieve sustained and inclusive growth and address some of these pressing issues.

“Increasingly we are seeing different stages of production taking place in different countries.  These global value chains across borders can lift the economic performance of entire regions and provide access to much bigger markets for the niche goods that New Zealand produces.  It also provides new opportunities for trade in high value services, such as IT, that New Zealand can offer.

“Asia is a significant hub for global value chains.  New Zealand is well placed to take advantage of this through our network of free trade agreements and business connections.”

Mr Groser will also attend the World Trade Organisation mini-Ministerial meeting and speak at the G20-OECD Stocktaking Seminar.

“I am looking forward to exchanging ideas with other Ministers and G20 members about steps that we all could take to prevent protectionism from diluting progress already made to open markets,” says Mr Groser.

While in Paris, Mr Groser will also meet with French counterparts to discuss climate change issues, and participate in business meetings to promote trade links between New Zealand and France.

**Background information:**

New Zealand joined the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1973.

The OECD Ministerial Council meeting will include Ministers from the OECD's 34 member countries, and other countries including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. Representatives from the IMF, World Bank and WTO will also attend.

Global value chains refer to different stages of production – from design, manufacture and assembly, to sales and service – taking place in different countries. For example, an iPod designed in the United States, with parts manufactured across Asia is assembled in China and sold in Australia.
