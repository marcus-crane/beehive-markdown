Changes to the thin capitalisation rules will help ensure multinational companies investing in New Zealand pay their fair share of tax, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says.

The changes flow from an issues paper released earlier this year.

“New Zealand welcomes foreign investors, but we expect everyone participating in the New Zealand economy to contribute their share of tax,” Mr Dunne says.

The thin capitalisation rules are designed to address the situation where non-resident investors can artificially load debt into their New Zealand investments to limit their tax exposure, so limiting interest deductions for foreign-owned firms.

However, they currently apply only where one non-resident owns 50 per cent or more of a New Zealand investment. This means that the rules apply to traditional multinational companies, but not to other types of non-resident investors, such as private equity investors.

“If other types of investors have the ability to take excessive interest deductions which reduce their tax liability, then that is not fair. The thin capitalisation rules should apply,” Mr Dunne says.

The Government has therefore decided to extend these rules to where

non-residents are acting together, and together have a controlling interest of a New Zealand investment. This change is expected to generate $20 million over three years from 2014/15.

Another area of concern is around the issue of shareholder debt, which can allow companies operating in New Zealand to have excessive levels of debt without the thin capitalisation rules applying.

“This defeats the intent of the rules, so we have decided shareholder debt should be excluded from the worldwide group safe harbour debt calculations.

“And this also means that groups with high levels of external debt should not be affected by these changes.

“Some technical issues still need to be resolved, including defining the ‘acting together’ test and making sure that extending the application of the rules to trusts does not inadvertently affect benign structures, Mr Dunne says.

“My officials will continue to work with interested parties to ensure the legislation works in practice.”

Legislation for the changes is expected to be introduced later this year, and the changes will apply from the start of the 2015/16 income year.
