The Government has further progressed the Pike River Implementation Plan with the release of a discussion document on a new regulatory regime for the mining sector.

Labour and Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says the discussion document proposes significant changes to health and safety regulation in New Zealand’s mining industry.

“It outlines regulatory proposals for improved mining and hazard and risk management, increased training, stronger worker participation systems and new emergency measures – all issues raised by the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy,” says Mr Bridges.

“These proposals have been developed in consultation with independent New Zealand and Australian mining experts.”

Mr Bridges says the announcement meets the Government’s plan to have all the recommendations of the Royal Commission in place by the end of the year.

“We made a commitment to the families of the victims of Pike River to ensure we implement every recommendation, and we are making good progress.

“I strongly encourage the mining industry and others with an interest in this area to submit on these important proposals. This is our opportunity to bring health and safety in the New Zealand mining sector into line with the highest international standards,” Mr Bridges says.
