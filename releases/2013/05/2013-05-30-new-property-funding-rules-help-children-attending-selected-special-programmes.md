Education Minister Hekia Parata confirmed today that schools with out-of-zone children attending selected special programmes may now be entitled to the Ministry of Education’s roll growth funding.

“There are eligibility conditions that will be applied and not all special programmes will generate funding for additional classrooms,” says Ms Parata.

Places like Auckland and Christchurch, because of growth pressures, have high demand for special programmes. It is important to urgently address the capacity issues in some schools in these areas.

“Demand for special programmes will continue to grow over time, particularly in the ethnically diverse areas of Auckland. Students who are eligible for entry into the special programme who live in the home zone will still be given priority ahead of out-of-zone students.

“The Ministry has generally encouraged the establishment of special programmes, as they meet the needs of our priority groups, Māori, Pasifika and children with special needs. This is good news for communities that are set to grow.”

The operational policy change will give schools with selected special programmes some certainty about roll growth classrooms. The Ministry of Education will negotiate an agreed entitlement roll with each eligible school, to ensure the viability of special programmes that draw from the wider community in areas of in-zone roll growth.

The Ministry of Education will review the policy’s impact on rolls and costs in three years time.

***Notes***

- This policy would, for the most part, enrol children in the nearest special programme that meets their needs. Normal policy rules would need to be applied relating to prioritisation of applications for enrolment.
- No separate enrolment scheme would be drawn up around the school that hosts the special programme. This policy is easier to administer than setting up different enrolment zones.
- Children in the selected property contributing special programmes will continue to be treated as out-of-zone (OOZ) for general purposes, but will contribute to the property entitlement of the school. OOZ enrolments not in one of the selected special programmes would not be counted for property purposes.
- The Ministry will consult with the schools and then set maximum rolls for the selected special programmes. Having agreed maximum rolls will provide certainty for both the schools and the Ministry with respect to costs.
- This policy change is not designed to enable the substantial growth of special programmes as such, but rather to prevent their demise due to in-zone growth taking up the space being used to enable their delivery.
