Trade Minister Tim Groser will travel to Washington tomorrow for the fifth US-NZ Partnership Forum next week.

“The US-NZ Partnership Forum provides the opportunity to further the relationship between New Zealand and the US and to expose New Zealand businesses to US Government contacts,” Mr Groser says.

“My visit is also an opportunity to continue our Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) discussions with the US.”

TPP Leaders, including Prime Minister Key and President Obama, met in the margins of the East Asia Summit in November 2012 and expressed a common interest to seek to conclude negotiations in 2013.

New Zealand’s exports to the US sit at around the $4 billion mark, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations hold the promise of further invigorating this trade relationship.

In addition to the US-NZ Partnership Forum, the New Zealand Embassy in Washington and the Consulate-General in Los Angeles will be staging a “New Zealand Week” showcasing New Zealand cuisine, Maori culture (the RNZAF Kapa Haka Group and band will be performing) and film. “NZ Week” also has an important business component with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise leading a group of New Zealand companies in the public safety and security sectors.
