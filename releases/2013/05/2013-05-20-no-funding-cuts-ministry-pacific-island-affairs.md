There has been no cut to the baseline funding of the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs in the 2013 Budget despite reports suggesting otherwise says Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hekia Parata.

“It has been reported that the Ministry’s funding has been reduced by $861,000 in this year’s Budget,” says Ms Parata.

“This is incorrect. Last year’s Budget included $653,000 of underspends from the previous two years’ budgets that were transferred forward to 2012/2013 due to delays in some projects. In addition it included $208,000 for special one-off projects funded by other agencies.”

Vote Pacific Island Affairs budget remains $8.7 million.

Budget 2013 sees a number of funding boosts for areas that will benefit Pacific people. These include:

- Housing - $100 million over three years to the Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes programme, targeting low-income households for home insulation
- Social Development - $1.5 million for Budgeting Services to help our Pasifika families and $35 million set aside in contingency for extended family members caring for children
- Education - $41.3 million in equity funding to support vulnerable children to participate in early childhood education
- Health - $21 million for rheumatic fever prevention and $35.5 million for diabetes and heart disease

“We are working hard to ensure that Pacific people are given the tools to succeed and that outcomes are improved across the board for all Pacific people,” says Ms Parata.
