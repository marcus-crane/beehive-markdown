Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named Clare Kelly as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Mexico.

“Latin America is becoming an increasingly important partner for New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.

“Mexico is our largest trading partner in the region but there is huge scope to further advance our relationship through trade and economic links.

“Mexico’s membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership brings a new dimension to our partnership and opens up many more possibilities for future collaboration in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Ms Kelly has previously served as a Unit Manager in the Trade Negotiations Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She was also part of New Zealand’s Mission to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva in the mid-2000s.
