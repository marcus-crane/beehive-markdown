More young New Zealanders in need of glasses to correct their vision have received free spectacles through a Government-funded subsidy.

“More than 28,000 children aged 15 years or under had their eyes tested and were given glasses if required last financial year – over 10,000 more than in 2008,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Over three quarters of the children who had their eyes tested required new frames, new lenses or repairs to their current glasses.

“Funding for the Children’s Spectacle Subsidy has nearly tripled under this government – from $2 million in 2007/08 to nearly $6 million last financial year.

“This extra funding has meant the number of children from low income families receiving the subsidy has grown considerably over the last four years.

“The Spectacles Subsidy is up to $287.50 a year and can help with the costs of a vision test and glasses.

“Anyone 15 or under with a vision problem whose parents have a current community services card or a high use health card is eligible for the subsidy.”
