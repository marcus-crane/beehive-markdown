The Government has committed $16 million over the next four years to continue the Ministry’s successful Historic Claims Resolution Process for those abused in care.

“It’s important we listen to those who experienced past abuse as children in state care, that we apologise and do what we can to put things right,” says Mrs Bennett.

To date more than 400 historic claims have been resolved.

“The funding announced today will allow us to continue to help the 760 people with outstanding claims and those who have not yet come forward.”

At the same time a plan is being developed to resolve all historic claims by 2020. The Historic claims process, established in 2006 includes those who first came into state care before 31 December 1992.

“Many of those who’ve had their claim resolved tell us the process made a positive difference to their lives because their experience has been acknowledged and the Government has done what it can to put things right,” says Mrs Bennett.

Often those positive changes will also make a different for their families as well.

In addition, the Confidential Listening and Assistance Service has provided support services to more than 700 people as a part of the historic claims process.

Close to $1.9 million over two years will enable MSD to help fund the Service.

Preventing the abuse and re-abuse of children is a priority for this Government. The White Paper for Vulnerable Children and the Children’s Action Plan provide more than 30 mechanisms and initiatives to better protect children.
