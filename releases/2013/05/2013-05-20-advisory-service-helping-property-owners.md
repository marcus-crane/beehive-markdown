Almost 50 appointments with independent advisors have been made for property owners facing rebuild and repair difficulties through the new Residential Advisory Service, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

Launched last week the Residential Advisory Service is for property owners needing help through issues affecting their home repairs or rebuild, including insurance issues.

“Phone lines opened at 8am on Thursday and by the middle of today the service had received 101 calls,” Mr Brownlee says.

Two emails have been received to the info@advisory.org.nz email address.

“Following those contacts 47 people have had full case assessments and appointments booked with independent advisers.

“A number of callers haven’t required referral to independent advisors and have been helped at the call centre stage.

“Some have been referred to Earthquake Support Coordinators, and CERA’s Earthquake Assistance Centres.

“Other callers are already in disputes resolution processes or mediation with insurers.

“Feedback to Residential Advisory Service call centre staff has been extremely positive so far, which I think is a reflection of this being a well-considered, consulted on and serviced operation,” Mr Brownlee says.
