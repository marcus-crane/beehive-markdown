Associate Minister for Social Development, Tariana Turia announced today an additional $8m over four years for the *E Tū Whānau* programme to help address family violence within Māori whānau, Pasifika, migrant and refugee

“Māori are over-represented in family violence statistics, both as victims and as perpetrators.  To achieve long-term and real change, we need to work with whānau, hapū and iwi to identify and use culturally relevant ways of changing attitudes and behaviours,” says Mrs Turia.

“The increase in funding will expand services to focus on Pasifika, migrant and refugee communities who are also vulnerable and need culturally relevant support and assistance to address issues of violence effectively.”

 “The programme is making an important contribution to violence prevention and intervention in families and communities around New Zealand because it takes a culturally relevant, collaborative and inclusive approach to change what may often be entrenched and inter-generational attitudes and behaviours that have led to violence,” says Mrs Turia.

*E Tū Whānau* also supports the development of culturally relevant practices, resources and professional development for practitioners who work with Māori, Pasifika, migrants and refugees. *E Tū Whānau* emphasises the concept of culturally relevant community action and contributes to the Better Public Services target to Supporting Vulnerable Children. *E Tū Whānau* is a deliverable of the Māori Programme of Action which is part of the Government’s Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families.
