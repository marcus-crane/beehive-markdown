The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū at Tangoio Marae near Napier, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Crown was represented at the signing by Mr Finlayson, Minister of Maori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, and Minister of Local Government and local Member of Parliament Chris Tremain.

“Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū were left virtually landless after Crown initiated military conflict, raupatu and other actions.” Mr Finlayson said. “We cannot fully compensate for those actions. But this settlement will bring benefits to Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū, and the wider community, as it allows it to develop an economic base in its traditional areas.”

The settlement includes financial and commercial redress amount of $23 million, the return of culturally significant properties including part of Opouahi Station and Opouahi Scenic Reserve and the Te Pohue Domain Recreational Reserve. Public access will not change.

“Today’s settlement is an important step towards resolving all historical Treaty grievances in a just and durable manner for the good of iwi and all New Zealanders,” Mr Finlayson said.

The settlement will now be given effect through legislation.

A copy of the deed of settlement is available on the Office of Treaty Settlements website.
