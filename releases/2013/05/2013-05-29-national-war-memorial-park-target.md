Work towards the National War Memorial Park is progressing well and is on target for the opening to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on 25 April 2015, Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee and Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson said today.

“The trench, above which the National War Memorial Park will be developed, is now visible along Buckle Street.

“Moving State Highway 1 underground will create an appropriately peaceful environment, for quiet contemplation and remembrance in the park and the War Memorial precinct.

“This cut-and-cover design, approved by this Government, is what makes the National War Memorial Park design the best option for commemorating our nation’s military history,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mr Finlayson says it avoids the pitfalls of earlier concepts such as a state highway running next to the neighbouring primary school playground, and through the park itself.

“Although the design errors inherited by this government meant the start of construction was delayed, we are now well on track for the opening date of ANZAC Day 2015.”

Necessary contracts have now been signed between the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, which is developing the park, and NZTA, which is carrying out the road works which are integral to the project design.
