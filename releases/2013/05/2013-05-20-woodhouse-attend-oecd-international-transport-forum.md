Associate Minister of Transport Michael Woodhouse departs today to represent New Zealand at the Annual Summit of the OECD’s International Transport Forum, to be held this week in Leipzig, Germany.

“The Summit is attended by Ministers from the Forum’s 54 member countries and is a good opportunity to be part of a global conversation on strategies for transport, as well as engaging in debates with international decision-makers including business leaders and leading academics,” Mr Woodhouse says.

Mr Woodhouse will sit on the panel for a roundtable on ‘Attracting New Sources of Private Finance to Transport Infrastructure’, which will focus on the potential to broaden the range of financial investors in transport infrastructure.

“The Presidency of the International Transport Forum revolves annually among member countries, and New Zealand will hold the Presidency in 2015, so this is a good opportunity to show New Zealand is committed to the Forum.”

Mr Woodhouse will also meet with Transport Ministers from the United Kingdom, China, France and Norway to discuss relevant transport issues and to share transport knowledge and experience.
