The Government is reprioritising $2.9 million of taxpayer funding in 2013/14 to help more New Zealanders interact with government in a digital environment, Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says.

“Eight government departments are contributing a total of $2.9 million to a club funding arrangement to progress this Better Public Services result area.

“The aim of the funding is to increase the efficiencies of agencies working together to allow more New Zealanders to interact with the Government online. Our target is for 70 per cent of New Zealanders’ most common transactions with government to occur online by 2017.”

The Department of Internal Affairs is running this result programme in conjunction with the Digital Service Council, with membership and contributions from the following agencies:

- Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
- Department of Conservation.
- New Zealand Customs Service.
- Inland Revenue.
- Department of Internal Affairs.
- New Zealand Police.
- Ministry of Social Development.
- New Zealand Transport Agency.

“This is a great example of state sector organisations working together to deliver better outcomes with no extra money, and with good collaboration, shared intent, and innovative ideas put into action,” Mr Tremain says. “With the club funding in place, the Digital Service Council will continue to shape the direction of the programme over the 2013/14 year, by sharing skills and expertise across agencies.”
