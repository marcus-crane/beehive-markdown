Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced Budget 2013 will provide an additional $1.2 million for wilding pines control and eradication work at Mid Dome in Southland.

It is estimated 8,000 hectares of land in the Mid Dome area is affected by medium to dense wilding pines infestation (100 to 2,000 trees per ha).

Another 60,000 hectares is affected on a smaller scale (1-100 trees per ha).

“This funding for the 2013/14 year will help protect landscapes and productive land at Mid Dome.

“Wilding pines compete with native flora and fauna for water and sunlight. In some cases its spread can lead to the extinction of native plants, effect indigenous ecosystems and species, pastoral farming, public access, forestry and increases the risk of fire,” Mr Williamson says.

The money for control and eradication work is in addition to the $115,000 a year Land Information New Zealand contributes to the Mid Dome Wilding Trust’s 12 year programme to control wilding trees at Mid Dome.

Mid Dome is a $9 million collaborative programme between Land Information, Environment Southland, Department of Conservation and local farmers.
