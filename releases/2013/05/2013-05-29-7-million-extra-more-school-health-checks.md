The Government is investing $7 million extra over four years to increase the number of children receiving free B4 School health and development checks, says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The government wants more Kiwi kids to have the best start at school and the extra funding will lift coverage from 80 percent to 90 percent of children,” Mr Ryall says.

“This is a significant improvement from a few years ago when only around half of four year old children had received a B4 School Check.”

“These checks make a real difference to children and their families – nurses identify any health or behavioural concerns that could affect a child’s ability to learn at school – and arrange for GPs or other services to provide further help and support if required.

“Some of the additional funding will be used to reach more children from poorer areas – sometimes their families need an extra hand to ensure their children get the free checks,” Mr Ryall says.

Over 191,500 four year olds have received a free health and development check before starting school – nearly 46,000 in the past eleven months.

The B4 School check is the eighth check of Well Child Tamariki Ora services for children.

The Government will now invest over $11 million each year to provide free B4 School Checks for all eligible four year old children.
