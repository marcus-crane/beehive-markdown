Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson has expressed his shock and sorrow at the death of Supreme Court Judge, the Honourable Justice Robert Chambers.

“Justice Chambers had an outstanding career as a servant of the law, ultimately appointed to the nation’s highest court,” Mr Finlayson said. “I was devastated to learn of his untimely death.”

“I served with him for many years on the Rules Committee of the High Court, and he had recently been appointed to the Council for Continuing Legal Education as the Chief Justice’s representative. He made a great contribution, and had only begun what was expected to be a long tenure on the Supreme Court.”

“He was involved in so many other areas outside the judiciary, and lived life to the full. It is not often one comes across the likes of Justice Chambers in the profession.”

“My sincerest condolences go out to his wife Deborah, his family and friends.”

Justice Chambers graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1975, and in 1978 gained a doctorate from the University of Oxford. He commenced practice as a barrister sole in 1981 and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1992. He was appointed a Judge of the High Court in 1999 and a Judge of the Court of Appeal in 2004. He was appointed to the Supreme Court in December 2011.
