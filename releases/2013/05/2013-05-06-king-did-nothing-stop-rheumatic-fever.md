Annette King is the last person who should bluster about National’s investment in rheumatic fever, says Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

“In her six years as Minister of Health she did nothing,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Despite declaring rheumatic fever a priority in 2001, she didn’t spend a dollar on it nor did she do anything else to stop it.

“Under Annette King rheumatic fever rates increased relentlessly.

“For the second Budget in a row we have almost doubled our investment – from $12 million, to $24 million, to $46 million.”
