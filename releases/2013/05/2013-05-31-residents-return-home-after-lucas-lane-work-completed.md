With a significant work programme in the Port Hills area of Lucas Lane completed, residents of the eight affected properties will shortly be moving home.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the area, which was last to be zoned green, was in danger of inundation from an old quarry which had been damaged in the earthquakes.

It was agreed that removing the 40,000 cubic metres of loose fill from the quarry above Lucas Lane would ensure the homes were safe and able to be occupied and no longer at risk of being subject to a landslip.

That required the co-operation of the owner of the land above Lucas Lane, as the earthworks would need to be carried out on his property for several months.

“This project has been unique and very challenging. It required a tight collaboration between the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, the city council, engineering firm Aurecon and the land owner,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I’m pleased to see that with the efforts of the project managers and the contracting firms involved, this work has been completed on time and under budget. The end result is that the city council can lift the section 124 notices those homes were subject to, and the residents can finally feel safe and secure in their homes.”

Mr Brownlee says approximately $1m has been spent on the works by the Crown and the city council.

Residents of Lucas Lane have welcomed the removal of the hazard.

“The work that has been carried out means we can stay in our homes and avoid significant disruption for our families,” the residents said.

“We appreciate the efforts of Minister Brownlee and CERA in carefully considering the future of our lane, the team at Christchurch City Council for responding to residents’ concerns and queries, and Downer for the incredible work that has been done on the site.

“To have the work completed by the end of May, as promised by CERA and the council, gives us all certainty for the future.”
