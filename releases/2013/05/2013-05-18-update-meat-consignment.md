Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye have this morning sought an update from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) about some consignments of New Zealand meat delayed in China.

“MPI has informed us that there are no food safety concerns around the product,” Ms Kaye says.

“We have been advised by MPI that most product is frozen and remains refrigerated. MPI also advises us that chilled product is being given priority clearance.

“MPI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) are working around the clock to provide technical information, documentation and assurance from New Zealand, so Chinese officials can proceed with clearance.

“We were informed about this issue on Tuesday and are taking it very seriously.

“Thousands of export certificates are issued daily and issues like this are part of being a trading nation, with more than 50 percent of our exports being food.

“Everyone is working to resolve this as quickly as possible.”

“MPI is working with the meat industry to ensure they are kept up to date,” Mr Guy says.

“It is important that reporting on this issue is well informed by fact because speculation could be harmful to New Zealand businesses.

“We value our close working relationship with China and remain confident that this issue can be resolved,” Mr Guy says.
