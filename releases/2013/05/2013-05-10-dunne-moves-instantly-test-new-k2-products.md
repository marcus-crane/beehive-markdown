Samples of the new K2 synthetic cannabis products that hit the market today to replace products banned yesterday have already been purchased for testing, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne said today.

“It is a cat-and-mouse game for now and if the industry wants to play it, we will play it too until we get the Psychoactive Substances Bill into law in August to fix this situation,” he said.

Mr Dunne said he had instructed officials this morning to secure samples of the new K2 products for testing immediately they showed up in stores.

“I want the testing done as quickly as possible. No one can have any confidence in the integrity of those behind these products.

“They are out to make a fast buck before the new legislation comes in and they have demonstrated time and again that they have not the slightest interest in the health and well-being of the young New Zealanders who use their products,” he said.

“For that reason, I think we need to look at exactly what it is that they are putting in their new products.”

Mr Dunne said the Psychoactive Substances Bill is currently before the Health Select Committee and will be reported back to Parliament in mid-June and law in time to replace the Temporary Class Drug Notices regime in August.

“We will win this battle with this irresponsible industry,” he said.
