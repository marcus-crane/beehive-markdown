Health Minister Tony Ryall has told district health boards (DHBs) to focus on improving waiting times for diagnostic tests.

Mr Ryall said even though thousands more diagnostic tests, such as MRI and CT scans, are being performed under this Government – people in some parts of the country are waiting too long.

“We want shorter waits for diagnostic tests. These tests help determine if patients require an operation or other treatment.

“Over the past four years this government has significantly increased the number of people having elective surgery and reduced the length of time people wait for a first specialist appointment – our focus is now on reducing wait times for diagnostic tests where there are unacceptable waits.

“We have set a “gold standard” of 95 per cent of patients receiving their diagnostic tests in 6 weeks or less by 2015/16. DHBs have step measures over the next three years to reach the gold standard.

“Currently 75 per cent of patients across the country are receiving their CT scan within 6 weeks and just over half are receiving their MRI scan within 6 weeks.

“Most DHBs are doing well. However, in some areas, such as Dunedin, wait times for non-urgent routine MRI scans can be up to 35 weeks.

“When we introduced a “gold standard" wait time for cancer treatment in 2009 some DHBs had unacceptable waits – however over the past few years we have moved that up so all patients ready for treatment now wait less than four weeks for radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment.”

Urgent and semi-urgent scans are dealt with much sooner. Non-urgent routine MRI scans include scans for general check-ups after surgery or checking if a family member with no symptoms is affected by a hereditary disease.

“This challenge is not new. In 2005 over 500 Canterbury patients were waiting more than a year for an MRI scan. And Southland Hospital’s radiology department limped along for years with only half the radiologists needed to run the service,” says Mr Ryall.

“In Budget 2012, the National Government announced plans to invest $16 million over four years for the faster diagnostic project to improve reporting and access to diagnostic tests and reduce waiting times.

“As part of the project, DHBs are for the first time collecting wait time data for a range of diagnostic tests to identify where there are hold ups in their system and where they can make improvements.

“DHBs in most parts of the country are making improvements as a result of the data. Capital and Coast DHB, for example, have increased the number of MRI scans performed by 25 per cent in the second half of last year by increasing their working hours, working closely with their neighbouring DHBs, and outsourcing some of the scans.

“Last year the Ministry of Health appointed Dr Alan List, a radiologist at Auckland DHB, to lead this work. He is travelling around the country visiting all DHBs to provide them with advice and support,” Mr Ryall says.

“We have achieved shorter waiting times for elective surgery and first specialist appointments and with our focus now moving to waiting times for diagnostic tests, I expect these to also reduce further.”
