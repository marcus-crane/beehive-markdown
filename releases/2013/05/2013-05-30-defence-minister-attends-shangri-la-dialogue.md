Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman is attending the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this weekend.

Dr Coleman will hold a range of meetings with his counterparts from around the world. He will meet US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, and a range of Defence Ministers from Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, the UK, France and Canada.

“New Zealand has a significant stake in the security of the Asia-Pacific region, and we participate actively in regional forums. The Shangri-La Dialogue provides an ideal opportunity to engage with a range of regional partners and to discuss the key security issues facing the Asia-Pacific region,” says Dr Coleman.

The Shangri-La Dialogue is the pre-eminent regional gathering of Defence Ministers, military chiefs, senior officials and non-government experts in the Asia-Pacific region. Around 30 countries will attend this weekend’s Dialogue.
