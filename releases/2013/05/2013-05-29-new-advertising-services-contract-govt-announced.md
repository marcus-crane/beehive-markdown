The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is in the process of finalising contracts with 37 advertising agencies that will make up the All-of-Government advertising services, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The new contracts are part of a public sector-wide Government Procurement Reform Programme aimed at making government buying as efficient as possible and reducing costs. It includes all public sector agencies, councils and up to 2500 schools.

“These advertising services contracts will deliver savings of at least $25 million over the life of the contracts,’’ Mr Joyce says.

“The contracts offer significant opportunity to improve the value for money delivered to government through lower provider fees and removal of individual agency tendering costs.

“All-of-Government contracts let to date are tracking to deliver $330 million over the contract lifetimes. Advertising Services is the 11th All-of-Government contract signed since 2009 which includes external legal services, computers, mobile voice and data, and air travel.

“For providers, the contracts provide a standardised way of engaging with government which will make it more cost-effective for them to do business with government.”
