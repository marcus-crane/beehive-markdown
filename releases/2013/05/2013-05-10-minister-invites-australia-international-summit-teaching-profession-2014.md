Education Minister Hekia Parata profiled New Zealand’s educational achievement at the Australian Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood Education in Sydney today.

“New Zealand has much to be proud of in our education system including year on year improvements in achievement. We also have a number of challenges,” says Ms Parata.

“Given the close relationship with Australia it is very helpful to have these opportunities to share information and thinking and learn from each other.’’

Ms Parata took the opportunity to invite Australia to the fourth International Summit on the Teaching Profession in March 2014, which New Zealand won the right to host last month.

The Standing Council comprises State, Territory, Australian Government and New Zealand Ministers with responsibility for the portfolios of school education, early childhood development and youth affairs.

The Council meets around three times a year. New Zealand has been a member since 1993.
