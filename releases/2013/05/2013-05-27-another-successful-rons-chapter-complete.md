Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has today welcomed the completion – on schedule and on budget – of the first section of Christchurch’s Western Corridor upgrade.

“As of today motorists travelling along State Highway 1 to the west of Christchurch are enjoying better travel times on a safer road – this is good for productivity and good for the environment,” Mr Brownlee says.

Russley Road, from Yaldhurst Road to Avonhead Road, has opened to four lanes of traffic and vehicles can again travel at 80km/h along this section of the Western Corridor.

The Western Corridor is part of Christchurch’s Roads of National Significance programme, one of three corridors – one each to the west, south and north of the city – which are critical in supporting the Christchurch rebuild and the economic growth of Canterbury through the efficient movement of people, freight and services, and by linking the Christchurch Airport, the Lyttelton Port of Christchurch and Central City.

“I’m sure Christchurch motorists are looking forward to the next stage of the Western Corridor being ready in February next year, with the third stage due for completion in the middle of 2014,” Mr Brownlee says.

“When completed in 2018/19, the Western Corridor will provide a four-laned expressway from north of Belfast through to Hornby.”
