Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand is providing a further $6 million to help Samoa recover from Cyclone Evan.

“The Samoan Government is working as quickly as possible to repair and rebuild - New Zealand is committed to supporting that effort,” Mr McCully says.

“This funding will go toward general reconstruction activities, with a focus on rebuilding for resistance to future natural disasters.

“It will assist in the rebuilding of public infrastructure and essential public services, helping businesses and producers get back to full capacity, and minimising the negative impacts of Cyclone Evan on the Samoan economy.”

Today’s announcement brings New Zealand’s total support to Samoa since Cyclone Evan struck in December to $12.6 million.
