Labour Minister Simon Bridges has announced new regulations that will raise the standard for workplace safety in petroleum exploration and extraction.

The Health and Safety in Employment (Petroleum Exploration and Extraction) Regulations 2013 replace the 1999 regulations and come into effect on 30 June.

“The Government is committed to responsibly managing and regulating the development of our oil resources,” says Mr Bridges. “These workplace health and safety regulations are the first major overhaul for the sector’s operations in nearly 15 years and will raise the bar for what is expected of the petroleum sector.”

The regulations strengthen the management of hazards, as well as safeguards associated with well drilling. This includes ensuring well integrity at every stage of an operation by requiring an installation safety case, a well operations notice and a well examination scheme.

Mr Bridges says the regulations bring New Zealand into line with best practice in the United Kingdom and Australia.

“They sit alongside extensive work the Government is doing to improve the management of New Zealand’s petroleum resources. We’ve reformed the Crown Minerals Act to support high health and safety and environmental standards and we are introducing a comprehensive environmental management regime for activities in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone.

“These changes and the regulations are part of our plan to safely and responsibly grow New Zealand’s $4 billion oil, gas and minerals industries,” Mr Bridges says.
