Contrary to Green Party claptrap that more and better roads don’t reduce congestion, Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee today welcomed further evidence they do.

“And what’s more, private and commercial vehicle operating costs are falling along with emissions,” Mr Brownlee says.

He was commenting following the release of NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) evidence that commuters travelling on the new Christchurch Southern Motorway Stage 1 are saving almost 20 minutes travel time a day.

“Quite why the Green Party hates the successful Roads of National Significance Programme beats me,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The first three of these seven roading projects are already saving New Zealanders time, improving their safety, and reducing fuel consumption.

“I repeat, the Roads of National Significance are really good for the environment, but the Green Party wants the public to ignore that.

“According to NZTA, Christchurch commuters are saving up to 18 minutes a day in travel time, despite a 15 per cent increase in traffic volumes on both the motorway and at the city end of Brougham Street.

“And they can expect even better travel time savings when the second stage of the Christchurch Southern Motorway is completed in 2018/19.

“We know from NZTA that Aucklanders are already benefiting from the completed Victoria Park Tunnel project with time travel savings of up to eight minutes a day.

“We know Waikato drivers are enjoying quicker and safer journeys on the Te Rapa section of the Waikato Expressway, saving up to five minutes a day during peak travel times and enjoying the benefits of less congested local roads into Hamilton.

“In fact when NZTA polled drivers on that road almost 90 per cent provided positive feedback about its efficiency and high standard.

“And very soon, thanks to the Government’s commitment to easing congestion, increasing productivity, improving safety and helping the environment, long suffering Wellingtonians will also benefit from the Roads of National Significance.

"Transmission Gully, the Kapiti Expressway and the inner city transport improvements including the Basin Bridge – all opposed by the Green Party – will be built, and I’m confident New Zealanders will appreciate them.

"Furthermore, these projects will all remove freight and other highway traffic from local roads and separate cyclists and pedestrians from highway traffic, enabling easier and safer journeys in and around the capital for people travelling on foot or by bike," Mr Brownlee says.

“And despite that, I bet the Green Party will still oppose them.”
