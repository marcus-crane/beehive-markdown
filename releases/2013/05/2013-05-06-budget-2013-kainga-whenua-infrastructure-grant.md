The Government has announced the Kāinga Whenua infrastructure grant aimed at helping Māori Land Trusts and other collectives to develop housing on ancestral Māori land.

“I am pleased to announce that $12 million over the next four years will be made available to Māori organisations to assist with the infrastructure work required for new greenfields development on their ancestral land,” Associate Housing Minister Tariana Turia says.

“This grant will assist with infrastructure like water reticulation and the development of infrastructure from the main road to the building site for power, roading, curbs and channelling.

“Kāinga Whenua infrastructure grants are another step in advancing housing aspirations for whānau, hapū, iwi and Māori Land Trusts, and will help unlock the economic potential of building on Māori land.”

The new infrastructure fund expands existing loans already available under the Kāinga Whenua scheme which were introduced to support the development of housing on multiply-owned Māori land where the complex ownership structure made it difficult to obtain loans for building.

In December 2012 the scheme was expanded to include Māori Land Trusts, whānau or hapū groups The income cap has been revised from $85,000 to $120,000 for one borrower and up to $160,000 for two or more borrowers, and loans can be used for home improvements, repairs and maintenance.
