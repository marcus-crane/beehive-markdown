Funding of $35 million over four years has been set aside in contingency for extended family members caring for children, recognising the difficult job they do.

More than 12,000 New Zealand children are being cared for by wider family members because of the death of a parent or family breakdown, Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says.

“We know they are doing a tough job, often on limited incomes with children who need extra attention and help, and we’re determined to support that.

“Without these carers, more children would need to be in state care.”

As part of the White Paper on Vulnerable Children, Mrs Bennett signalled additional financial help would be made available for carers receiving the unsupported child benefit and orphan’s benefit.

“This funding will improve the support available to kin carers and grandparents raising grandchildren,” Mrs Bennett says.

A ministerial reference group has been established to provide further advice to the minister.

“We’ve invited Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, a foster care representative, and other experts to tell us how they think these funds could best be utilised,” Mrs Bennett says. “These groups know better than anyone what would make the most difference.”

The Ministerial Reference Group will report back to Mrs Bennett in August.
