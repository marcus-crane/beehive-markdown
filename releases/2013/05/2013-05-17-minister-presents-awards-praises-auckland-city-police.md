Police Minister Anne Tolley has today congratulated Auckland City Police officers for their dedication to tackling and preventing crime.

The Minister was presenting awards and medals to Police staff in recognition of bravery, good conduct and long service, at a ceremony in Auckland Town Hall.

“The performance and results of Auckland City Police in the past year have been outstanding,” says Mrs Tolley.

“There were over 6,500 fewer recorded crimes in the district last year, a drop of over 12 per cent.

“At the same time, there was a huge increase in foot patrols, and it was great to thank officers in person for all their hard work.

“It is always an honour to present awards at Police ceremonies, and today’s recipients thoroughly deserved to be acknowledged for their dedication to duty.

“With the rollout of smartphones and tablets we expect our Police to be even more effective in reducing crime, but today was all about recognising the excellent work of the last year.

“I also want to thank the families of our Police staff who provide such solid support and encouragement, in what is a demanding and often dangerous career.”
