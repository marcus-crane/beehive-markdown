Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of career diplomat Wendy Hinton as Ambassador to Poland.

“New Zealand and Poland have strong historical ties, having fought together in Europe in World War II, and this year we are celebrating our 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations,” Mr McCully says.

“Poland’s expanding economy offers opportunities for New Zealand business, particularly in education services and agri-business.”

Ms Hinton has more than 20 years’ experience working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both overseas and in Wellington. Most recently Ms Hinton was New Zealand’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva.
