Talofa lava. Malo le soifua maua. Malo le lagi e mama.

Education Minister Hekia Parata announced that an online directory, which lists information produced by a range of government agencies in the Samoan language, will go live today.

“I am absolutely delighted that this resource – part of a broader Pacific Languages Compendium – will become available in Samoan Language Week,” says Ms Parata.

“It is intended for people who want to know what government information or services are available in their own Pacific language. This is very exciting and I congratulate the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs for this initiative.

“It makes it clear the support across government for the Samoan (and many other Pacific) languages in New Zealand, detailing specific resources and services available in Samoan from a range of agencies.

“These range from information on Census 2013 to fire safety messages.”

The Samoan Language Directory is one element of a package collating government services and resources available in a total of 14 Pacific languages. Other elements cover educational resources for Pacific language learning, and government initiatives such as action plans or programmes that support Pacific people living in New Zealand.

Ms Parata says publication of the compendium, compiled by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs as part of its work to promote and maintain Pacific languages, was extremely well-timed.

“Samoan Language Week is not only becoming a well-recognised fixture on our calendar each year, it has also provided a model for other Pacific New Zealanders to celebrate their languages and cultures in a similar way. This year there is a bumper crop, with seven Pacific language weeks in the diary.”
