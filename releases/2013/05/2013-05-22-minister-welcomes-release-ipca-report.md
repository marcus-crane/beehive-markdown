Police Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the release of an Independent Police Conduct Authority report into Operation Eight.

“I am pleased that the IPCA has found that the Police decision to take action in 2007 was justified,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The vast majority of fair-minded New Zealanders will back the Police to act when they believe public safety is at risk.

“However, the IPCA also found that some of the Police actions were unlawful, and that more could have been done to lessen the impact on a small community.

“The Police have accepted this and have apologised.

“I have discussed the report with the Commissioner and I have been assured that the Police have learned valuable lessons from these events, and have made significant changes in the almost six years since the operation.

“I will be keeping a close watch to ensure that the Police continue to act on areas for improvement, especially around rebuilding relationships.

“It must be remembered that four people were convicted as a result of the Police actions, and that no one was hurt in any of the operations.

“When people are running around with guns and Molotov cocktails the public would expect the Police to take action, and will back them to do so in the future if required.”
