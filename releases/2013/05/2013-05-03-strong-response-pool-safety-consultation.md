Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says more than 260 submissions have been lodged since a consultation document on the Fencing of Swimming Pools Act was released six weeks ago.

Removing vague and inconsistent rules, improving national consistency and maintaining child safety are aims of the document.

“People have been giving views on how to protect young children from drowning whilst reducing compliance costs for pool owners and councils.

“It’s crucial hearing where to strike the balance. My recommendations to the Cabinet later this year will be informed by the submissions.

“Everyone, no matter what side of the debate they’re on, wants to reduce the number of drownings in home pools and make them a rarity.

“For many, the rules in place have been frustrating, as people have had to try satisfy the absolute letter of the law, as opposed to focusing on the intent of trying to save lives,” Mr Williamson says.

The public can make submissions at [www.dbh.govt.nz/consultingon-pools](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/consultingon-pools) The submission period closes on May 10th.
