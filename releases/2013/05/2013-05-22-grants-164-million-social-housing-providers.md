Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced $16.4 million of grants to support six community housing providers to complete social housing developments in Auckland, Northland, Hamilton, Bay of Plenty, Wellington, and Canterbury.

“These grants are part of the Government’s housing strategy to grow the community social housing sector. They complement the legislation announced in the Budget that enables community social housing providers to receive the same funding as Housing New Zealand to provide tenants with acute housing needs access to income related rents,” Dr Smith said.

The Minister made the announcement while opening Vision West’s Community Housing Development in West Auckland. Vision West has previously received $2.9 million of funding from the Social Housing Fund.

“This funding will support the supply of 100 new social and affordable housing units throughout New Zealand and deliver 239 bedrooms to families in need. The total value of the developments is approximately $34 million. This is the second round of grants from the Government’s $139 million Social Housing Fund.”

The successful providers are: Accessible Properties New Zealand Limited, Airedale Property Trust, Habitat for Humanity, Whangarei Accessible Housing Trust, the Tauranga Community Housing Trust, and one other South Island provider (pending community consultation).

“New Zealand has a small community social housing sector. These initiatives are designed as the first steps to grow the sector. We believe these housing trusts can stretch the public dollar further and provide a better service for tenants. Our long term objective is for 20 per cent of social housing to be provided by community organisations.

“This announcement to grow the community social housing sector is just a small part of the Government’s overall housing strategy. We are spending a record $2.9 billion on Housing New Zealand, including reconfiguring its stock to ensure it is of better quality, in the right place and of the right size. We are spending a further $100 million on home insulation. We also have work on Housing Accords, Special Housing Areas and the Housing Warrant of Fitness to make houses more affordable and of better quality.”
