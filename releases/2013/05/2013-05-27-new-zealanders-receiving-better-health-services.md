“New Zealanders are getting more checks for diabetes and heart disease, more help to quit smoking and more operations faster,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall releasing the latest national health target results.

“DHBs have made substantial progress since the Government streamlined national health targets four years ago to improve health services for patients.

“That continues this quarter with further improvements helping provide New Zealanders with better experiences in health care.

“94 per cent of patients were admitted, discharged, or transferred from emergency departments this quarter within the six hour target – the best result to date.

Unfortunately one patient across the country missed the target for shorter waits for cancer treatment by two days.* Approximately 2700 other patients with cancer started radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment in this period within the gold standard of four weeks.

The more heart and diabetes checks target reached 58.9 per cent this quarter, an improvement of 3.6 per cent compared with the previous quarter.

Around 45,000 people had a heart and diabetes check carried out by their GP team this quarter – this brings the total number of people who have received a 5-yearly check to 741,268.

The hospital target for providing better help for smokers to quit is working well with all DHBs over 90 per cent. 31,799 hospital patients who smoked were offered help to quit. DHB performance for this target is now ranked according to the primary care result – up by 8.4 per cent this quarter.

The elective surgery target is achieved, with 6878 more operations than planned. A total of 116,171 operations were performed – 6 per cent more than planned for the year to date.

The increased immunisation target remained on 89 per cent this quarter. Seventeen DHBs achieved the 85 per cent target. This means 13,698 of the 15,401 eligible children were fully immunised by eight-months of age in this quarter. “This helps ensure children have the best start,” Mr Ryall said.

Results will be published in newspapers tomorrow.

\*The Ministry advises the delay is unlikely to have a negative impact on the patient’s treatment results.
