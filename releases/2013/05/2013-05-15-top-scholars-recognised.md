Wellington College students Thomas Leggat and Nicholas On have been jointly awarded this year’s Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence.

Education Minister Hekia Parata attended an event where Prime Minister John Key presented the award at the Top Scholar Award ceremony at Government House today.

“This Award recognises the top-achieving student in the annual New Zealand Scholarship awards and is the highest academic accolade students can aim for at secondary school,” says Ms Parata.

“Thomas and Nicholas each achieved such outstanding results in last year’s Scholarship exams, choosing between the two was impossible.”

Thomas achieved Outstanding Scholarships in Classical Studies, History, and Media Studies and Scholarships in Economics, English, Geography, and Statistics and Modelling.

Nicholas achieved Outstanding Scholarships in Chemistry, Mathematics with Calculus, Physical Education, and Statistics and Modelling and Scholarships in Biology, and Physics.

“Both students not only reached the pinnacle of academic success in their school careers, but also displayed strong leadership qualities and all-round achievement in areas such as sport and debating.

“Thomas and Nicholas’ achievements across the board show a work ethic and desire to succeed that will hold them both in good stead for future success.”

Thomas is now studying towards a conjoint Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts at the University of Auckland, while Nicholas is studying Health Sciences at the University of Otago.

Earlier at the ceremony 35 Top Subject Scholar Awards and 10 Premier Scholar Awards were presented by the Governor-General, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae and Minister of Education Hekia Parata, respectively.

Winners of Premier Awards and the Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence are recommended to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority by an expert panel of academics.
