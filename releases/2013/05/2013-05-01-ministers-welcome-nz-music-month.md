Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss and Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye are encouraged that New Zealand’s home-grown music scene continues to go from strength to strength, as the 13th NZ Music Month gets underway.

More than 350 events are planned across the country this month to promote and celebrate Kiwi artists.

“Kiwi music is becoming more and more accessible thanks to the emergence of digital platforms and the availability of content online, as well as through traditional broadcast media and live performance. This means Kiwi artists can not only reach an audience at home, but also overseas,” says Mr Foss.

“It is heartening to know that talented young people have the support of a strong New Zealand music industry. New Zealand Music Month is a superb opportunity to celebrate both established and emerging young Kiwi artists,” says Ms Kaye.

“Recently we have seen the likes of Lorde – who has been hailed by US website Buzzfeed as a future star – and Kimbra, who this year won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the Grammy Awards. These artists and other New Zealand musicians show some of the talent and creativity inherent within young Kiwis,” says Ms Kaye.

“It is fantastic we have a whole month dedicated to supporting New Zealand musicians and artists with hundreds of promotional events running throughout May,” says Mr Foss.
