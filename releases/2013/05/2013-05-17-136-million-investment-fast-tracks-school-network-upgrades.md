Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the Government will invest $136 million over the next four years to complete the School Network Upgrade Project (SNUP) by 2016 - two years ahead of schedule.

Of this funding, $50 million is new money and comes from the Future Investment Fund to pay for new public assets.

“This Government is committed to providing modern learning environments that help all of our kids to succeed. This means putting in place the technology that supports their learning in the 21st century,” says Ms Parata.

“And today we are committing to delivering that two years earlier than originally planned.”

“We are also announcing as of June 2013, wireless capacity will be included in the school network upgrade process,” says Ms Kaye. “Many students I talk to want wireless so that they can do schoolwork wherever they are in the school.

“We believe in the value of providing affordable, uncapped, high-speed, quality connections that will create learning opportunities for all students.

“Young New Zealanders need 21st century skills and access to the tools of a modern economy to succeed. By 2016, almost 98 per cent of schools will have ultra-fast broadband connections.

“This multi-year funding to speed up SNUP is vital to ensure schools’ internal networks are upgraded,” says Ms Kaye.

SNUP upgrades the wiring infrastructure and internal data networks of schools.

“It gives schools consistent internal networks that can take full advantage of the Government’s investment,” says Ms Kaye.

“More than 1400 schools are part of the School Network Upgrade Project to date, which is around 60 per cent of all eligible state and state-integrated schools.

“The investment in technology infrastructure is also about making sure that students and teachers around New Zealand can take full advantage of all the benefits of the Government’s $1.35 billion investment in the ultra-fast broadband network.”
