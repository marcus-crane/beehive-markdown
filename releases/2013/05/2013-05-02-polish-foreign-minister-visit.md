Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will meet his counterpart from Poland, Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, tomorrow.

Mr Sikorski’s visit marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Poland.

“New Zealand has a warm relationship with Poland, which is fast becoming an influential member of the European Union,” Mr McCully says.

“This visit will be a chance to discuss increased cooperation with Poland, particularly in the agricultural and education areas. We will also discuss New Zealand’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.”

While in New Zealand, Mr Sikorski will also meet Culture and Heritage Minister Chris Finlayson.
