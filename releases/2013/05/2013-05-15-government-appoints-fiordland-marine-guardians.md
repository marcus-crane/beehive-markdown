Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced the appointment of two new Fiordland Marine Guardians and the reappointment of five existing Guardians.

“I am pleased to announce the appointment of Rebecca McLeod and Jonathan Clow. Their wealth of experience in the environmental science and tourism sectors will be invaluable to the work of the Guardians,” Ms Adams says.

“I would also like to thank Sir Alan Mark and Alan Key who are leaving the Fiordland Marine Guardians after many years of service.

“Sir Alan has provided valuable input on conservation and environmental matters and Mr Key has brought a recreational fishers’ perspective to the Guardians.”

The Guardians play an important role in protecting Fiordland’s unique marine environment. As community representatives, they educate people on local environmental issues and ensure the community is involved in decisions affecting Fiordland's coastal marine environment.

The Fiordland Marine Guardians implement the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Management Act 2005.

The Fiordland Marine Guardians are:

- Stewart Bull
- Jerry Excell
- Ken Grange
- Malcolm Lawson
- Anne McDermott
- Mark Peychers
- Rebecca McLeod
- Jonathan Clow
