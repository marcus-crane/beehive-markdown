Energy and Resources and Labour Minister Simon Bridges leaves for Japan today where he will address the annual Nikkei Forum and meet with business and political leaders.

Mr Bridges has been invited to speak at the Nikkei conference in Tokyo on the theme “Exploring New Partnerships between Asia and the World.”

“Asia is an important and growing export and investment partner for New Zealand and I welcome this opportunity to meet ASEAN leaders and build on our relationships in the region,” he says.

Mr Bridges will hold meetings in Tokyo with Japanese ministers and business leaders, with a focus on bilateral energy and resources co-operation and climate change issues.

The Minister returns to New Zealand via Brisbane where he will attend the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association conference, the premier annual oil and gas event in the Southern Hemisphere.

“This event attracts over 3000 attendees from 30 countries, and is a major platform on which to promote New Zealand as a highly prospective and stable investment destination,” says Mr Bridges.

The Minister will meet his Australian counterpart, Resources and Energy Minister Gary Gray, and hold discussions with oil and gas company executives. He will also host a New Zealand business function.

Mr Bridges returns to New Zealand on 29 May.
