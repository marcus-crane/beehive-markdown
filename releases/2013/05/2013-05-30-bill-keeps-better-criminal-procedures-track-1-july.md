The Criminal Procedure Legislation Bill, passed unanimously by Parliament this evening, will ensure the upcoming criminal procedure reforms can be given their full effect when they come into force on 1 July, says Courts Minister Chester Borrows.

“The reforms contained in the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 represent the most significant reform of criminal procedure in 50 years. They will simplify and streamline court process and speed up the time it takes for cases resolved,” says Mr Borrows.

The Bill makes a range of small fixes, improvements and changes to address issues found while preparing for the criminal procedure reforms to come into force.

“I welcome these amendments so the 2011 Act operates as Parliament intended and so that from 1 July New Zealanders can start benefiting from these changes.

“Changes under the Criminal Procedure Act will result in fewer wasted appearances at which cases are simply not progressed, less delay, and a more transparent and efficient system.”

Over the coming years, the effect of the new laws will be to:

•           Reduce the average time it takes to resolve a court case  by 6-9 weeks

•           Eliminate 31,200 court events per year to progress the same caseload, which is about 10,000 sitting hours, or 13% of the national total

•           Reduce the number of cases that require a jury trial every year by 350-500 cases.

The changes to criminal procedure sit alongside other measures to modernise courts through greater use of technology, improved processes and a focus on the frontline and the people the courts serve.
