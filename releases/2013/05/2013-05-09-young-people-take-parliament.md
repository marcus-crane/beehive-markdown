Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the names of the Youth Members of Parliament and Youth Press Gallery, as well as the topics they’ll be discussing at Youth Parliament 2013.

“Tonight I am hosting a Youth Week function at Parliament to recognise young Wellington school leaders and announce the young people to take part in Youth Parliament,” Ms Kaye said.

Each Member of Parliament has selected a young person aged 16 – 18 to represent them and their community at Youth Parliament to be held at Parliament on 16-17 July 2013.

“Youth MPs have an exciting few months ahead as they get out and talk to other young people in their schools and communities in order to bring their perspectives directly to the heart of our democracy,” Ms Kaye said.

“Youth Parliament 2013 is an opportunity for young New Zealanders to have their say on the big issues and to share their hopes and aspirations with MPs, government officials and the public.”

While at Youth Parliament, the Youth MPs will sit on Select Committees of inquiry, attend caucus meetings, ask oral questions of Cabinet Ministers and engage in legislative and general debate in the House.

“As well as representing their community at Youth Parliament in July, Youth MPs will hold their position from 1 May to 31 December 2013,” Ms Kaye said.

“During this time, they can actively engage with their community to gain an understanding of the ideas and concerns of young people. They can then lobby their MP to ensure they hear those views.

“The point of this is to ensure young people understand Government and learn how they can influence decision-making.”

There will also be a Youth Press Gallery reporting on Youth Parliament 2013. These aspiring political journalists will have the opportunity to work on reporting from 1 May to 31 December 2013. During this time they will provide updates of the Youth MPs’ activities in their communities. The Youth Press Gallery members are selected by the Parliamentary Press Gallery.

Youth Parliament 2013 is a joint initiative of the Minister of Youth Affairs and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and is organised by the Ministry of Youth Development in collaboration with the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Parliamentary Service.
