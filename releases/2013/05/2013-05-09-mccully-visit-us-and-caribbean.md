Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will depart late this week on a two-week trip to the United States and Caribbean.

“The relationship between New Zealand and the US has gone from strength to strength over the last five years,” Mr McCully says.

In Washington, Mr McCully will meet his counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry, and attend the fifth US-NZ Partnership Forum, which brings together public and private sector leaders from both countries for discussions on business, trade and investment, security, and foreign policy issues.

On route to the US, Mr McCully will travel to Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Bahamas where he will address the Caribbean Community Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and promote New Zealand’s bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.

“Being part of the Pacific, we understand the issues facing small states, and I look forward to discussing the opportunities and challenges facing the region,” Mr McCully says.
