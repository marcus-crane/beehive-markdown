Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated the 38 new Police officers from Wing 276 at today’s graduation ceremony in Porirua.

“It is always an honour to attend Police graduation ceremonies, where I am able to personally wish new officers a safe and successful career,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I also took the opportunity to thank all of the families in attendance, as their continued support is extremely important to our officers.

“Today’s graduates are the first intake to receive smartphones and tablets to help them provide more effective and efficient frontline crime prevention, as the rollout of over 6000 mobile devices continues to officers across the country.

“With crime rates at a thirty year low, and recorded crimes falling in each of the last three years the new graduates have a lot to live up to, and I am confident they will deliver excellent service to our communities.”

Another 80 recruits are currently attending the Police College, while a further 440 recruits are planned to go through the training course by the middle of next year, as Police keep pace with anticipated attrition.
