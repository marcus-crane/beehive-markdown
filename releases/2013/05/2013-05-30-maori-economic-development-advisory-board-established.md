The Ministers of Economic Development and Maori Affairs have appointed a five member Advisory Board to assist in the implementation of the recently adopted Māori Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan, He Kai Kei Aku Ringa.

The strategy and action plan, prepared by the independent Maori Economic Development Panel, provides a blue print for Māori economic development through to 2040.

The Advisory Board’s responsibilities are on-going stewardship, monitoring and evaluation of the strategy and how it will be implemented.

The five-member Board will be chaired by Ngahiwi Tomoana, currently the chair of Ngati Kahungnunu Iwi Incorporated.

The other members are:

- Debbie Ngarewa Packer - Chief Executive Officer of Ngati Ruanui
- Pania Tyson-Nathan - Chief Executive Officer of Māori Tourism
- Kingi Smiler, who holds multiple governance roles including Chairing Miraka Ltd, the Wairarapa Moana Incorporation and the Tairawhiti Land Development Trust
- Hilton Collier - a farmer and farm advisor based in Wairoa with strong experience in Māori agribusiness

“The appointment of Ngahiwi Tomoana and Debbie Packer, previous Panel Chair and Panel member respectively, will bring background knowledge and continuity to the Advisory Board. The other Advisory Board members contribute a diversity of experience in business and particularly in businesses in which Māori are well-represented,” Mr Joyce says.

Dr Sharples says “He Kai Kei Aku Ringa sets out six goals to support Maori economic growth including greater educational participation and performance, building a skilled and successful workforce, increasing financial literacy and savings, enabling growth, development of natural resources, and Maori Inc. as a driver of economic growth.”

“In essence it is supporting our Maori economic development on a broad front, and this skilled and experienced group of people are charged with guiding and refining the direction of the Strategy and Action Plan over the next 5 years.”

The board will report directly to the two Ministers on their achievements.
