Labour MP, Phil Goff, has breached a Coroner's suppression order relating to the non-combat death of a soldier in Afghanistan says Defence Minister, Dr Jonathan Coleman.

"Mr Goff has tonight publicly released pages from a Court of Inquiry report into the death of a soldier in Afghanistan that is subject to a Coroner’s Court suppression order. He needs to explain why he's attached these pages to a press release in defiance of the Coroner's explicit instruction,” said Dr Coleman.

"Goff claims I have refused to release the report; what he's forgotten is that to do so is illegal."

"What's more his claim that Crib 19 troops of the NZ PRT in Afghanistan were inadequately trained is not correct. The fact is that all the training could not be completed in New Zealand prior to departure, and the remainder was completed in theatre prior to starting their operational roles."

"Presumably there will be consequences for such a flagrant breech of a suppression ruling,” said Dr Coleman.
