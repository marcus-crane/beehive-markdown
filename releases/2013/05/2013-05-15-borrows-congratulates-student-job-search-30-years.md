Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows today congratulated Student Job Search on 30 years of helping students find work.

He will tonight host university leaders, student union representatives, Student Job Search staff and employers at a Beehive function celebrating the milestone.

“Student Job Search provides an important service connecting students to part-time and holiday work during their studies,” says Mr Borrows.

“This gives the students valuable work experience, as well as income to help students support themselves through their study and reduce their reliance on Government assistance.”

Established in 1983 by student associations, Student Job Search deals with over 20,000 students and employers each week. The Ministry of Social Development supports Student Job Search with $3.3 million per year through StudyLink.

“This modest investment delivers real returns to the economy. This financial year Student Job Search has already made more than 22,000 job placements, with student earnings of over $63 million.”

“I want to thank Student Job Search for the contribution they have made over the last 30 years, and I look forward to continuing to work with them in the future,” says Mr Borrows.
