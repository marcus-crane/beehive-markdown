Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Period 4 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 4, which was paid on the morning of 15 May, paid 84,577 people a total of $162.29 million.

The PwC report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.42 per cent of staff across the country, 36 staff were notified as not paid, 122 were overpaid, and 195 underpaid. Affected staff were from 247 schools or 10.1 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“This was another positive result showing a consistent performance within the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the technical review team. Four of the last five pay rounds have met that mark,” Mr Joyce says.

“At this stage indications show that Pay Period 5 is likely to have a similar low number of issues.”

Mr Joyce says the Backlog Clearance Unit (BCU), with the help of the IRD, has now resolved the outstanding 2012/13 tax issues caused by Novopay for around 3000 school employees.

The BCU is continuing to work closely with schools to clear the backlog of outstanding issues.  Good progress has been made over the last two weeks with around 7,000 issues cleared in total.  However, there are still around 18,000 issues to clear, including around 5900 outstanding pay instructions and 11,800 overpayments.

Work is continuing on the Novopay Remediation Programme with another bug release scheduled for 30 May.

“Progress is continuing on resolving all these issues and I want to acknowledge and thank school staff, administrators and principals for their on-going patience,” Mr Joyce says.
