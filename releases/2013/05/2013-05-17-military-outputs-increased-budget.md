Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman says the New Zealand Defence Force is improving its military capability in this year’s budget as it realises the benefits from the annual savings it has achieved.

“In the year to July 2013 the NZDF will deliver $190 million dollars in savings after achieving $140 million dollars in the year prior,” said Dr Coleman.

“These savings free up resources to improve the Defence Force’s military capability. The Defence Force budget estimates for 2013 sees increases across a range of military outputs, such as Land Combat Forces, Naval Patrol and Support forces, and Fixed Wing Transport forces,” he said.

“These funding increases to the military outputs deliver on the government’s promise in the Defence White Paper to shift resources from the back office to the frontline.”

“There has also been a significant increase to the Defence Capital budget reflecting the military upgrade projects the government has approved, including the ANZAC frigate system upgrade, Seasprite helicopter replacements, and new medium and heavy trucks,” said Dr Coleman.

“This sees the NZDF Capital expenditure budget increase from $318 million to $583 million for the financial year.”

“Budget 2013 confirms the Defence Force reforms have achieved the difficult task of making back office reforms and achieving savings while also delivering projects to enhance the Defence Force’s military effectiveness,” he said.
