The first safety audit providers approved to audit adventure activity operators under a new standard have been announced by Labour Minister Simon Bridges.

“I welcome Outdoors New Zealand, Bureau Veritas and Verification New Zealand as providers recognised by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to carry out safety audits of adventure activity operators,” says Mr Bridges.

The Minister’s announcement follows his release in March of a new safety audit standard which operators must pass before being eligible for registration.

“These three providers have been independently assessed against an international auditing standard and against their ability to apply the new safety standard. They are already active in auditing the safety management systems of adventure activity operators and have the capability to carry out audits objectively,” says Mr Bridges.

“New Zealand is renowned for its adventure tourism and the safety audit standard is one of a number of initiatives introduced over the last three years to strengthen the safety of the industry.

“This includes implementing the Health and Safety in Employment (Adventure Activities) Regulations 2011 which resulted from a review of safety measures in the adventure tourism sector in 2009/2010.”

Mr Bridges says the three providers will soon begin targeted auditing of adventure activity operators as part of the implementation of the Regulations.

From 1 November next year, it will be an offence to provide an adventure activity without being audited. Operators will be re-audited at least every three years.
