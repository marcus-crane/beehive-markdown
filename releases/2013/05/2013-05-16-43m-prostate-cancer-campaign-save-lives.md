Budget 2013 will deliver $4.3 million over four years to raise awareness of prostate cancer and ensure men have better access to quality information and care, Health Minister Tony Ryall says.

“About 3,000 New Zealand men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and more than 600 die from the disease,” he says. “I am advised a new prostate cancer awareness campaign will lead to better survival rates.”

The prostate cancer campaign funding will be used to:

Develop information resources for men and their families.

Create GP support material to help men and their doctors make informed decisions about prostate cancer tests and treatment.

Develop clinical standards to make sure all men have fair and equal access to quality cancer care.

“Advice on prostate cancer tests and management can be confusing and there has been a great deal of conflicting information, which makes it hard for men and their families to make informed decisions,” Mr Ryall says.

“The Health Select Committee also identified that there are currently differences in the quality of care available to men.

“The new funding will help to develop national standards and guidelines for prostate cancer, which will lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and care.”

Prostate cancer is most common in men over 50 years of age.
