Justice Minister Judith Collins has expressed her sadness at the sudden loss of Supreme Court Judge, the Honourable Justice Robert Chambers.

“I am extremely sad to learn of the sudden death of Justice Robert Chambers.

“He was renowned across the profession as one of New Zealand’s greatest legal brains. His sudden death at such a young age is a significant loss to the legal community.

“I instructed Justice Chambers on many occasions when he was a barrister. I served with him on the Auckland District Law Society Council for a number of years and when he became President, I was Vice-President. I will always remember Justice Chambers’ for his humanity, terrific wit and way with words.

“My thoughts are with his wife Deborah, his family and friends, at this very sad time.”
