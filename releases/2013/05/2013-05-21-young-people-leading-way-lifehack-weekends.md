Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is impressed with projects developed by young New Zealanders during a series of Lifehack weekends held around the country in April.

“Around 100 young people took part in the sessions, working in teams alongside mentors from technology companies, universities and the social sector,” Mrs Bennett said.

“A range of innovative projects were pitched, with ten chosen to progress to the development phase, with teams receiving funding and support to progress their ideas.”

“Each idea uses online and digital technology to explore better ways of supporting young people dealing with anxiety, depression, isolation and other mild to moderate mental health issues,” Mrs Bennett said.

The Lifehack initiative is part of the Social Media Innovations Fund, which aims to improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people at risk through the use of technology.

The projects include an app allowing young people to post videos talking about challenging situations in their lives and how they’ve faced them, developed by Dunedin team Upside.

Wellington’s Myquest team also came up with an idea for a website encouraging young people to set goals for themselves, and then input a series of steps to help them reach that goal.

“Each one of these projects is the result of young people thinking big and ‘outside the box’ about what tools work best for them and the issues they face,” Mrs Bennett said.

“The support they’ve received from sponsors like Westpac, Facebook, Vodafone, and Microsoft has been fantastic, and hugely encouraging for the Lifehack initiative’s continued success.

Launched in February this year, the Social Media Innovations Fund provides $2 million over four years, and is one of eight MSD-supported initiatives in the Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health Project.

Other initiatives include Youth One Stop Shops, 12 of which have received $50,000 one-off funding to support them in providing health and social services to young people.

The Government is also increasing the presence of youth workers at low decile secondary schools, with ten further workers taking up roles in Northland, Hawkes Bay, and Wellington secondary schools by Term 3 this year.
