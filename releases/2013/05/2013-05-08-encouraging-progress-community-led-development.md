Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew said today she was encouraged by the way communities have embraced a new approach to community development.

Visiting Whirinaki, one of the five communities taking part in the community-led development initiative, Mrs Goodhew said the community had achieved some great results, both with projects they are undertaking and in building local residents’ sense of pride in their community.

“For example there is a really exciting awa (river) restoration project which aims to protect the community’s water supply, ensure everyone has clean, potable water, prevent water pollution, encourage the return of native plants, eels and other fish life and reduce the flood risk.

“During my visit I saw obvious signs of progress such as cleared river banks, fencing and planting, and heard local people speak with satisfaction about their achievements.

“Another project aims to increase the number of speakers of the local Te Hikutu hapu dialect.  This will help ensure the continuation of key cultural practices and underpin the leadership role of Kaumatua and Kuia in the community.”

Mrs Goodhew also visited Mt Roskill, another of the participating in the initiative. She met with the community leadership group there to discuss their experience of being part of the new approach and their plan to use local neighbourhood events and projects to gain residents’ input into a comprehensive community plan.

“The process they are planning in Mt Roskill goes to the heart of community-led development, where people are able to participate more fully in deciding what happens in their community.

“I am really excited to hear what ideas the community comes up during this process and to then seeing Mt Roskill achieve its community vision.”
