Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne today announced the make-up of the interim expert advisory committee that will help set the safety testing regime for legal highs under the incoming Psychoactive Substances Bill.

The committee – to be chaired by Otago University Associate Professor of Medicine, Richard Robson – will have a key advisory role and has been specifically charged with designing the testing regime under which producers or distributors would have to prove the substances they wish to sell are low risk.

Professor Robson already chairs the Standing Committee on Therapeutic Trials and the Medicines Advisory and Assessment Committee, and is an acknowledged authority in clinical pharmacology, assessment of medicines and clinical trials.

The other members of the committee are:

- Malcolm Tingle, Associate Professor, Department of Pharmacology, Auckland University.  Expert in toxicology and clinical pharmacology.
- Paul Fitzmaurice, Bio-analytical Programmes Manager, ESR. Expert in Forensic toxicology, neurodegenerative disorders and addiction.
- Sanya Ram, Senior Tutor, Pharmacy Law, University of Auckland. Expert in pharmacology and law.
- Bob Kerridge, executive director SPCA. Expert in animal welfare.

“I am very happy with the make-up of the committee. There is a wealth of experience and expertise, across clinical and legal areas, but also real balance with the presence of renowned animal welfare authority, Bob Kerridge.

“I am very confident that this committee will provide robust advice as we move forward with the world-leading Psychoactive Substances Bill,” Mr Dunne said.

The legislation will be in place by August.
