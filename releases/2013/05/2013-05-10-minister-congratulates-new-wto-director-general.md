Trade Minister Tim Groser today congratulated Roberto Carvalho de Azevedo on his appointment by consensus as Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

“As one of the nine candidates nominated for the position of Director General, I was gratified by the fair hearing I received from WTO members. The campaign provided a unique opportunity to talk with members and groupings in the WTO and to hear their views on the Doha process.

“It is now very important that the entire membership unites behind Ambassador Azevedo. I know Ambassador Azevedo personally and am confident that he has the skills and commitment to ensure the WTO is positioned to achieve the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda, including the much needed deeper reform of the rules relating to agricultural trade. As fellow Cairns Group members, Brazil and New Zealand share an interest in promoting a fair and even playing field for all members through the multilateral trading system,” Mr Groser says.

“During my campaign I was struck by the myriad of challenges facing the new Director General. To maintain the relevance of the WTO and reignite the negotiation function will not be easy. New Zealand is committed to doing our utmost to support Ambassador Azevedo in his role as Director General and to provide constructive input into the negotiations as they move forward.

“The first step in that process will be the 9th WTO Ministerial Council in Bali later this year. I hope that meeting will make progress in a number of areas, and can provide us with the impetus to continue our work towards an ambitious and comprehensive package of trade reforms,” says Mr Groser.
