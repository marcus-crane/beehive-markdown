Guidelines for company directors on leading and managing health and safety in their workplaces have been launched by Labour Minister Simon Bridges.

“This is an important milestone in addressing both the recommendations of the Pike River Royal Commission and the Independent Taskforce on Workplace Health & Safety which sought guidance for directors on their responsibilities,” says Mr Bridges.

The guidelines provide directors with advice on how they can influence health and safety performance in their organisations, their roles and responsibilities, diagnostic questions and actions, a checklist and case studies.

“These guidelines are an essential tool for every company director. Directors should be in no doubt that workplace health and safety is a business priority and they must actively lead it,” Mr Bridges says.

“This is an important step towards achieving the urgent step change in health and safety that the Independent Taskforce believes we need. Everyone has a responsibility to make sure that objective is achieved, and soon.

“I want to acknowledge the leadership of the Institute of Directors in helping to develop the guidelines, jointly with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and employer and employee representatives. I thank them for their commitment to promoting this initiative to members,” Mr Bridges says.
