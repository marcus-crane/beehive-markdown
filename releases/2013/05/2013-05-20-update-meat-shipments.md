Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has provided an update on progress being made in resolving the delays in clearance for some meat exports to China.

“Resolving this delay is the number one priority for the Ministry for Primary Industries.

“New Zealand officials have worked around the clock to provide additional technical information to Chinese authorities over the weekend.

“This information will be given to AQSIQ, the Chinese organisation responsible for border clearances. This will enable them to pass it on to port authorities, a process which may take some days.

“New Zealand officials are also talking with their counterparts in China today to see what, if any, further information or support is needed.

“Overall trade to China is still flowing well and this issue appears confined to some shipments of meat.

“Most product is frozen and is being properly stored, while priority for clearance is being given to chilled meat.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries is also keeping in close contact with the meat industry and updating them on a daily basis.

“New Zealand is a trading nation and from time to time these kind of technical delays will occur. This is a temporary issue, but we’re confident it can be resolved,” says Mr Guy.
