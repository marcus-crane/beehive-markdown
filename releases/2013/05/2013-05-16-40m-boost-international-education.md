Budget 2013 invests $40 million over the next four years in marketing and promoting New Zealand’s international education industry, as the country targets doubling the value of international education to $5 billion by 2025.

“This $40 million investment through the Government’s new Education New Zealand Crown agency will continue to strengthen New Zealand education’s presence in key markets such as China, India, South-east Asia, and South America, and will attract more international students to study in New Zealand,” Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

The funding forms part of the $400 million internationally-focused growth package over four years, which is a centrepiece of Budget 2013.

“International education currently contributes more than $2 billion to our economy each year and supports approximately 32,000 jobs,” Mr Joyce says.

“In 2012, nearly 100,000 international students studied in New Zealand and almost 3,000 students were enrolled in New Zealand education institutions offshore.

“Although the income from international education is important, it is the strong people-to-people links that flow from it that brings the greatest benefit to New Zealand. 

“Former international students are often employed overseas for New Zealand companies, and international students are great advocates and ambassadors for New Zealand in their home countries.”

The new funding will be invested in:

- Broadening and intensifying international student recruitment activities in existing and developing markets.
- Offering increased support for New Zealand international education providers and businesses to achieve greater growth.
- Encouraging greater delivery of New Zealand’s education services abroad.
- Increasing the participation of New Zealanders in overseas study by establishing new scholarships and encouraging the take-up of existing scholarships.
- Deepening New Zealand’s engagement with overseas education institutions and governments.

“Our high-quality education sector, together with the lifestyle experience that New Zealand provides for international students, is a combination few other countries can match,” Mr Joyce says.

“This boost in funding will enable our education industry to continue to market New Zealand as an education destination that has world-class institutions, outstanding teaching and research staff, and qualifications that are valued and transferable throughout the world.”
