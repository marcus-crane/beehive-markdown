Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins has today announced the Government’s plan to extend the Office of Ethnic Affairs’ Language Line telephone interpreting service to private sector organisations.

Language Line currently offers immediate access to interpreters speaking 44 languages to help people who speak little or no English communicate with government agencies.

Addressing the Ethnic People In Commerce (EPIC) NZ Conference in Auckland today, Ms Collins said expanding Language Line to the private sector will make it easier for ethnic and migrant communities to do business in New Zealand.

“Over the past decade Language Line has facilitated more than 300,000 transactions between government agencies and its clients,” Ms Collins said.

“Introducing Language Line into major banks, for example, will support migrant business owners and their friends and family to set up a bank account and access the financial services they need to do business here.

“This is fantastic news which will make it easier for new migrants and their families to integrate quickly and successfully into life in New Zealand.”

Ms Collins said the expansion of Language Line also underscores the value this Government places on New Zealand’s migrant and ethnic communities.

“We’re committed to seeing each and every person in this country receive the information, advice and services they need to get ahead and make a better life for themselves and their families,” Ms Collins said.

“New Zealand is a hard-working nation and we know our ethnic businesses have a tremendous contribution to make to our future prosperity.”
