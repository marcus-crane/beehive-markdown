Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse is pouring cold water on claims that ‘upwards of 5000’ parents could be left in New Zealand by absent sponsors, as claimed in a story featured in the NZ Herald and Otago Daily Times today.

“The claim is based on a false assumption that just because nearly 3000 New Zealand resident sponsors are currently overseas, that thousands of their parents have been left behind in New Zealand,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“In fact, nearly two-thirds of parents – more than 3200 – whose child sponsor has left New Zealand have actually left with them.

Immigration figures show that of more than 5000 parents of absent sponsors, fewer than 1850 have remained in New Zealand.

Mr Woodhouse says that parents could have very good reasons for remaining in New Zealand, including holding down a job, having other children and family in New Zealand, or even having found a New Zealand partner.

The sponsor could also only be out of New Zealand temporarily and planning to return to New Zealand shortly, Mr Woodhouse points out.

“The purpose of the parent category visa is to incentivise more skilled migrants and business investors to New Zealand, and we still need more of both.”

“Migrants play a crucial part in New Zealand’s current and future economic success, and it is important that anecdotes and figures used without context don’t diminish this truth in the public’s eye.”
