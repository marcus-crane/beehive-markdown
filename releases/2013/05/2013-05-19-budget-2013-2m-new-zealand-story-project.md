Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced $2 million in new funding to launch the New Zealand Story project – an initiative to help New Zealand companies gain a competitive advantage from the use of the New Zealand brand in international markets.

The funding forms part of the $400 million internationally focused growth package which is a centrepiece of Budget 2013.

The New Zealand Story project was outlined in the Building Export Markets progress report as part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda, and received initial baseline funding of $1 million.

“This project is about broadening New Zealand’s international brand beyond the scenic beauty of the country to include attributes like our innovation and resourcefulness, our Māori heritage, and our welcoming friendly approach,” Mr Joyce says.

“We need a compelling, but authentic story which will differentiate New Zealand from other countries and showcase what we have to offer around the world. It needs to be able to be used by educationalists, food and beverage producers, hi-tech manufacturers and other organisations in their marketing efforts offshore.

“We are a small country so we need all our international players, private sector and public sector, as much as possible to tell a consistent New Zealand story that reinforces each other’s activities for the benefit of New Zealand as a whole.

“The New Zealand story is being developed with extensive input from leaders in the primary sector, manufacturing, wider government, services, export education and Māori, and being tested in six key and emerging markets.

“This new funding will be used to bring the story to life and ensure we use it effectively.

“The funding will include the development of creative tools which New Zealand businesses and the public sector can draw on to tell the New Zealand story, including consistent branding, messaging, audio visual elements, and photos.”
