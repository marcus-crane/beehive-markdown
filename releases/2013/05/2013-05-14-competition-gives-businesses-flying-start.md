Small Business Minister John Banks says SME owners looking to grow their business should enter the ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition run by Business.govt.nz. 

The competition – now in its third consecutive year - seeks out the best business plans from businesses and start-ups across New Zealand with an annual turnover of less than $1 million.  There is $80,000 worth of prizes up for grabs. 

“The ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition run by Business.govt.nz has become a regular fixture in the business calendar, and for good reason,” says Mr Banks.

“Having a detailed, well-researched business plan is a real advantage. It helps sell your enterprise to others, but more importantly it helps you identify the risks and opportunities ahead so you can make the best decisions for your business. 

“We are a nation of small business owners in which 97 per cent of all enterprises employ less than 20 people, so competitions like this and online resources like Business.govt.nz are incredibly valuable.

“They encourage and support Kiwi entrepreneurs to keep delivering the kind of innovative new businesses that keeps New Zealand at the cutting edge.” 

The supreme award winner will receive $58,000 worth of prizes. This includes:

- •$30,000 cash from ANZ for approved growth opportunities
- $10,000 of consulting and development services from The Marketing Bureau
- $5,000 of business education or management training from Stellaris
- $5,000 of advertising/editorial in NZBusiness Magazine
- $5,000 of legal advice from Lane Neave Lawyers
- $3,800 for a virtual office package from Servcorp

The second and third prize winners each receive $5,000 in cash from ANZ. 

The 14 regional winners each receive $1,000 cash from Ernst & Young, MYOB, OpenHost and Servcorp.

Mr Banks says interested SME owners should check out the competition and sample the online tools, calculators and resources at [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz). 

The team at Business.govt.nz and ANZ will also be on hand to answer any questions about business planning or the competition through the ANZ Flying Start Competition group on LinkedIn.
