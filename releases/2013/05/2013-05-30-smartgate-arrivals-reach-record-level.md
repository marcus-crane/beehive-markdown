Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says the number of eligible New Zealand and Australian passport holders using SmartGate on arrival has broken the 70 per cent mark for the first time.

SmartGate is Customs’ automated passenger processing system, which was introduced in 2009. Since its roll out in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch almost six million people have used it.

About 50,000 people every week are processed by the technology when arriving or departing New Zealand.

“It’s great to see so many Kiwis and Aussies embracing SmartGate, which is a simple and efficient way for people to self-process at the border.

“The success of SmartGate is helping deliver on the Government commitment to make it easier and faster for travellers at the border through the use of technology,” Mr Williamson says.

About 56 per cent of eligible SmartGate users are self-processing when departing the country.

“Customs will soon start testing SmartGate Plus, which is a next generation prototype. It’s a one-step system which eliminates the kiosk and the ticket, making the user experience a lot faster.

The prototype will be installed and tested at Air New Zealand’s premiere departure check in at Auckland International Airport next month.
