Popular areas of central Christchurch will reopen to the public today with the latest reductions to the rebuild zone taking effect, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“From 11am the cordon will be reduced to allow a temporary pedestrian corridor through Cathedral Square from the Worcester Street Bridge to the intersection of Gloucester and Colombo Streets.

“It will remain open until demolition work in the Square prevents access.

“Also at 11am today parts of High Street, between Cashel and Lichfield Streets, and between Lichfield and Tuam Streets, will be reopened to pedestrians,” Mr Brownlee says.

“These reductions are possible because of work by CERA, the Christchurch City Council, contractors and property owners to remove hazards, and I want to acknowledge the effort all of them have made to open up more of the CBD to Christchurch residents.

“Immediately after the February 2011 earthquake the central city cordon covered 387 hectares.  By April this year it had reduced to 38 hectares, and today’s reductions reduce it further still.

“The cordon reductions will continue until the rebuild zone cordon is removed completely, most probably in June.

“While the rebuild zone and its New Zealand Army checkpoints will go, fencing will remain in place around many buildings and work sites as construction, demolition and infrastructure work continues, and in some areas it may increase over time depending on the nature of work required,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Crown is continuing its programme of purchasing central city properties for anchor projects listed in the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, and to date has agreements in place for 40 per cent of the designated land.

Of the buildings purchased by the Crown, three are currently being demolished to make was for anchor projects, another demolition is due to start in June, and a further 15 are at various stages of planning for demolition.
