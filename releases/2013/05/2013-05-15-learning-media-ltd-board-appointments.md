Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the appointment of Jenn Bestwick as Chair of Learning Media Ltd, and the reappointment of Taria Tahana as a director.

Ms Bestwick is a Christchurch-based consultant with in-depth knowledge of the education sector, strategy, and business development.

“Ms Bestwick will bring to the role strong governance and leadership experience, as Chair of the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) and a member of Tourism New Zealand and Southern Response Earthquake Services,’’ says Ms Parata.

“Learning Media has significant capability and expertise, with a publishing and production record to be proud of. It has, however, struggled to find its business niche, and I am looking forward to Ms Bestwick providing the leadership to do this.”

Ms Tahana has served on the board since 2010 and brings pertinent understanding of Maori development combined with experience on a range of entities including Te Mangai Paho, the Environmental Protection Agency, Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa, Ngati Pikiao Iwi Trust, and Korowai Aroha.

Ms Parata acknowledged the contribution of outgoing Chair, Sandy Maier, who has served on the board since 2009.

The appointments are until 30 April 2016.

Learning Media Limited (Te Pou Taki Kōrero) is a New Zealand state-owned enterprise. The company has been the publisher of the majority of the Ministry of Education's curriculum resources for many years. A division of the Ministry until 1993, it is the current publisher of the School Journal and Junior Journal magazines and the Ready to Read readers for the Ministry, as well as services for other organisations.
