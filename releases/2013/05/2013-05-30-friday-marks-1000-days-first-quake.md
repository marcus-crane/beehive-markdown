Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says this Friday will be a special one for Cantabrians as it marks a thousand days since the first violent earthquake that triggered so much upheaval for the region’s people.

“To mark the milestone I’d like to thank all those who have helped in whatever capacity, from voluntary to official, in responding to the earthquakes and helping shape the recovery that is so clearly underway,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It’s not easy to comprehend the sheer scale of this event, so I’ve highlighted 100 things big and small that paint a picture of the scope of the Government’s response.

“I could list many more examples of great commitment to Canterbury at a local level and nationally,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Rebuilding Christchurch is one of this Government’s four priorities for this term and a huge amount will be done over the next 1000 days to see that achieved for the benefit of the region’s people.

“But now is a good time to reflect on just how far we’ve come, some tragic losses, and to acknowledge how much energy and passion thousands of people have put into the recovery.”
