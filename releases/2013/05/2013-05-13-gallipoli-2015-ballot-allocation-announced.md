Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse says the vast bulk of New Zealand’s 2000 passes for Anzac Day 2015 at Gallipoli will be available for all New Zealanders.

“The Gallipoli campaign played a significant part in the evolution of our nationhood, and Anzac Day holds a special place in New Zealanders’ hearts.

“The annual commemorations at Gallipoli attract a broad spectrum of New Zealanders and it’s important that we uphold this tradition in 2015.”

As confirmed in February, a total of 10,500 places will be available at the commemorations, with 2000 allocated to New Zealand, 8000 to Australia, and 500 for official representatives from Turkey and other countries.

New Zealand’s 2000 attendance passes will be allocated as follows:

- 75 per cent (750 double passes/1500 places in total) by ballot for all New Zealanders (including descendants and veterans who were unsuccessful in their specific ballot).
- 10 per cent (100 double passes/200 places in total) by ballot for direct descendants of Gallipoli veterans.
- 10 per cent (100 double passes/200 places in total) by ballot for veterans of all conflicts.
- 5 per cent (100 places in total) reserved for special groups such as youth representatives and children of Gallipoli veterans.

“The decision on how to allocate passes was informed by the public consultation we carried out in 2012.”

Applications for the ballot will open on 1 November this year, with results announced in April 2014. Guidance on how to apply will be available on the Gallipoli2015 website closer to the time.

Mr Woodhouse said that while attendance passes would be free, those New Zealanders who were successful in the ballot will need to make their own travel arrangements and meet all their own costs.

The New Zealand Government, in conjunction with the Australian Government, will tender for a company to run the ballot.
