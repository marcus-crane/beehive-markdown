Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of career diplomat John Mataira as Ambassador to Afghanistan.

“New Zealand has made a significant commitment to Afghanistan over the last 10 years, and while our Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) has now left Bamyan, that commitment will continue through our development projects and military personnel based in Kabul,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Mataira, who has been PRT Director since December 2012, will lead engagement with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and liaise with other agencies and diplomatic missions.

Mr Mataira has previously served in Los Angeles, Japan, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.
