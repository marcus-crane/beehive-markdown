The Government will continue supporting Computer Clubhouse, a free after-school learning environment giving young people access to technology, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew says.

The Department of Internal Affairs will receive $1.9 million over 2013/14 to 2015/16, funded from existing contingencies, to support the scheme.

“Computer Clubhouse enables young people to use technology to work on projects and build information and communications technology skills,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“It is an internationally-recognised learning model that provides a safe, creative place where young people work with mentors, explore ideas and build skills through using information and communications technology.

“Support for programmes such as this is an excellent example of community groups, the Government and the private sector working together to improve access to and uptake of digital technology.”

The funding builds on allocations in previous Budgets.
