Budget 2013 provides an additional $134 million in contingency capital funding for new school property, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“This Government is committed to investing in education and will ensure that schools are provided with high-quality infrastructure. Our focus is to ensure that we deliver more modern learning environments that are safe, connected, fit for purpose, and inspiring to both teachers and students,” Ms Kaye says.

“This funding will support growth in the schooling network by providing new schools and kura, and more classrooms on existing sites where required. The need for extra capacity in schools is driven by increases in student numbers through higher birth rates and internal migration, particularly in Auckland, Hamilton and Queenstown.

“With a book value of $10.5 billion, school property is the Government’s second largest property portfolio behind housing, with around $500 million being spent annually as capital reinvestment directly within schools.”

In Budget 2013, the Government sets aside $134 million to deliver more modern learning environments. This money has been put in contingency and will be drawn down as decisions are made later in the year.

The Government is committed to addressing the current range of issues affecting school property across the country, Ms Kaye says.

“To make sure we are getting the best value for taxpayers, we have conducted a review into school property and this year will consider its findings.

“The Government has also committed $1 billion to rebuilding the education sector in greater Christchurch as part of our commitment to not just put back what was there, but focusing on what can be done better,” Ms Kaye says.
