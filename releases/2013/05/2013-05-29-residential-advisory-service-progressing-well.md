Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the number of cases being assessed by the Residential Advisory Service a week after its launch is nearing 100.

“In the first week of operation the service has received 250 contacts, over half of which have been able to be handled at the call centre stage with referral to other agencies or directly to the callers’ bank or insurance company,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We have 91 more complex cases being actively progressed, most of which are insurance related, and I know the insurers and EQC are all intent of getting these issues understood and resolved promptly.”

The Residential Advisory Service was established following thorough community consultation on the best way to support the residents working through complicated issues relating to their rebuilds and repairs.
