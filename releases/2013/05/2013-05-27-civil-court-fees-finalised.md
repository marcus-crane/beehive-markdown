Changes to civil court and tribunal fees will ensure those who benefit from the courts contribute to their costs while protecting access to justice, Courts Minister Chester Borrows says.

The new regime, released today and coming into effect from 1 July 2013, is the result of a first principles review of civil court fees started in 2011.  The review was designed to update civil court and tribunal fees in a way that is principled, simple, reflects the private benefit received by court users, and protects access to justice.

“Access to the courts to resolve civil disputes is an important part of a just and democratic society, but it’s not fair on the taxpayer to ask them to bear the whole cost of resolving private disputes,” says Mr Borrows.

“The changes released today strike a better balance, ensuring access to justice while asking for a reasonable contribution from those who use, and therefore benefit from, civil courts and tribunals.”

Currently civil court and tribunal fees recover around 14 per cent of the running costs.  These changes will raise approximately $4.1 million per year, increasing cost recovery to 17 per cent.

“These changes take into account the helpful feedback the Ministry of Justice received to their consultation paper last year.  This has resulted in some proposals being adjusted to place greater emphasis on the public benefit of some courts, for example the removal of a proposed hearing fee for the Human Rights Review Tribunal,” says Mr Borrows.

The majority of the fees changes take effect from 1 July, except for:

•           Civil enforcement fees in the District Courts, which are likely to take effect later in 2013 as they are dependent on changes to the District Courts Rules coming into effect first.

•           Fee changes which are dependent on amendments to legislation are likely to come into effect in 2014. These include those relating to the Employment Court, Environment Court and four tribunals – Accident Compensation Appeal Authority, Accident Compensation Appeals (District Courts Registry), Real Estate Disciplinary Tribunal and Copyright Tribunal (licensing schemes).
