Health Minister Tony Ryall today inspected construction progress at the new national blood donor and laboratory centre in Christchurch.

Mr Ryall was joined by staff from the New Zealand Blood Service and Ngāi Tahu Property who are working in partnership to build the new centre.

“Construction started this month and already truckloads of dirt have been removed from the site for the new foundation,” says Mr Ryall.

“The new state of the art blood centre will be around 2500m². It will have more donor beds to meet the growing demand for plasma. It will be fitted out with the latest laboratory equipment for testing and manufacturing, and have a specialist warehouse for storing blood products.

“The new centre will help ensure New Zealanders receive the blood treatments they need, even as demand continues to increase. It will also enable New Zealand to remain self-sufficient in the supply of blood and blood products,” says Mr Ryall.

“Many other countries have to import blood products to meet demand. For example Australia currently imports around 40 per cent of their intravenous immunoglobulin products as they don’t receive enough plasma donations.”

The project is currently on schedule and the new centre is expected to open in early 2015.
