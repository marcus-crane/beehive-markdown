Health Minister Tony Ryall has asked consumer advocate David Russell to oversee an independent panel to review the auditing, monitoring and accreditation of residential disability providers.

The Minister’s actions follow the Ministry of Health cancelling the contracting of Parklands, a residential provider from South Auckland.

“I have also asked the panel to review the Ministry’s handling of historical complaints about Parklands back to 2001,” says Mr Ryall.

“We want to provide assurances to the residents of these facilities and their families about the quality of care they are receiving.

“In the last couple of years the Ministry has been far more assertive and proactive in managing performance of disability providers.

“Last month the Ministry appointed two external reviewers, Karen Van Eden and Beverly Grammer to look at how the Ministry can better manage provider performance to ensure it meets the needs of people with disabilities.

Miss Grammer is the president of the Disabled Persons Assembly and a consumer of disability services. Ms Van Eden is a highly experienced management consultant with experience in the health and disability sector.

“The Director General of Health, Dr Kevin Woods, and I have agreed that Miss Grammer and Ms Van Eden will work with Mr Russell as a panel and now report directly to me.

“The panel is expected to report back in three to four months.”
