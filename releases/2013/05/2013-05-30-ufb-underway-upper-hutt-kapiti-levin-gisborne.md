Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today announced that work to build a high-speed fibre broadband network is to start in Upper Hutt, the Kapiti Coast, Levin, and Gisborne.

Ms Adams joined the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) partner, Chorus, at an event in Paraparaumu this morning to mark the start of the project in the four deployment areas.

Work begins today in Upper Hutt, Levin and Gisborne, while the Kapiti Coast gets underway on June 20.

UFB deployment in Levin has started about six months ahead of schedule, while the starting dates for Upper Hutt, the Kapiti Coast and Gisborne are several weeks ahead of plan.

Today’s announcement means that UFB deployment is underway in 28 towns and cities through New Zealand.

“The deployment of UFB is one of the largest and most transformative infrastructure projects ever to be undertaken in New Zealand. We continue to make good progress on a fibre network that will ultimately transform New Zealand’s connectivity,” Ms Adams says.

“Taking fibre direct to businesses, schools, hospitals and households will provide a real opportunity to boost productivity and innovation.

“I am looking forward to seeing how Upper Hutt, the Kapiti Coast, Levin, and Gisborne ensure they maximise the opportunity that this UFB network will provide.”

Over the build period, the UFB network will be in reach of more than 48,000 premises in Upper Hutt, the Kapiti Coast, Levin, and Gisborne.

In addition to the 25 schools in these areas that are already able to access the Government’s UFB network, a further 18 schools will be covered by the network within the next 12 months.

The UFB initiative involves Government investment of $1.35 billion – alongside private sector funding – to roll out fibre to schools, hospitals, and 90 per cent of businesses by 2016, and links to homes and remaining businesses completed by 2019.
