Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain has praised the efforts of the Waka Tapu crew for successfully completing a return voyage to Rapanui (Easter Island).

After spending nearly 200 days at sea, the two waka hourua (traditional double-hulled sailing canoes) arrived back in Auckland today to an enthusiastic welcome from family, friends and supporters. 

“The crew of the two waka travelled 10,000 nautical miles using only celestial navigation to guide them - relying on the stars, moon, sun, ocean currents, bird and marine life, rather than modern technology such as GPS,” says Mr Tremain.

“This is a significant achievement and a true testament to the traditions and skills of tangata whenua.  By retracing the journey that their ancestors took, the crew have helped ensure the retention of indigenous navigational and environmental knowledge for future generations of New Zealanders.”

“I offer my heartiest congratulations to Waka Tapu’s crew and their supporters – they should feel an immense sense of pride in their accomplishment.”

The historic journey was organised by the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute in partnership with Te Taitokerau Tārai Waka, with the objective of teaching and transferring knowledge of Maori and Polynesian culture – particularly traditional sailing methods – to future generations.  The Institute has also established a school where they teach young New Zealanders the construction techniques used in building waka.

Hekenukumai (Hector) Busby built the principal waka, Te Aurere, in the early 1990s and the second waka, Ngahiraka Mai Tawhiti,was completed by 2011.
