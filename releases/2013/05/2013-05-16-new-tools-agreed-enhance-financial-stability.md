Finance Minister Bill English and Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler have signed a memorandum of understanding on measures aimed at further protecting the economy and financial system from boom and bust cycles.

This follows Reserve Bank consultation over recent weeks with the banking and financial sector.

“Excessive credit growth, followed by a bust, was at the core of the global financial crisis,” Mr English says.

“While New Zealand’s banking system avoided the upheaval that engulfed some other countries, the Government has agreed that the Reserve Bank should have extra measures available to reduce New Zealand’s vulnerability to such cycles.”

Banks already have to meet increased capital and liquidity requirements. In addition, the memorandum, signed this week, provides four new measures for the Reserve Bank to apply if necessary.

They would require banks to:

- Hold additional capital on their balance sheets as a buffer during an economy-wide credit boom.
- Hold additional capital against loans in specific sectors if risks emerge in those sectors.
- Adjust their funding ratios to use more stable sources of funding to avoid short-term funding shortages.
- Apply quantitative restrictions on the share of high loan-to-value ratio loans in the housing sector.

“These extra tools, if it becomes necessary for the Reserve Bank to apply them, will help to promote financial stability,” Mr English says.

“They will increase the resilience of the financial system during periods of rapid credit growth or easy liquidity conditions, and help to dampen excessive growth in credit and asset prices.

“While the tools may help to support monetary policy, the official cash rate will remain the primary monetary policy instrument.

“As many countries have seen in recent years, boom and bust cycles in credit and asset prices can pose real risks for homeowners and businesses, and destabilise banking systems.

“They can also pose a significant risk for the Government’s balance sheet. Improving macro-prudential policy is therefore an important step in reducing vulnerability to future risks.” 

At this stage, the extra tools would apply to registered banks, which account for most lending to New Zealand households and businesses.

As set out in the memorandum of understanding, the Reserve Bank would consult the Minister of Finance ahead of making any macro-prudential policy decision.

However, final policy decisions would be made independently by the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr English says.
