Trade Minister Tim Groser will attend the Pacific Alliance Ministerial Meeting and Head of State Summit in Cali, Colombia on 22 and 23 May.

“This is the first meeting New Zealand has attended since being granted observer status to the fast-growing Latin America economic bloc known as the Pacific Alliance, which includes Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru,” says Mr Groser.

“As an observer, New Zealand will be better placed to build on our existing relationships, and to share experiences and learning on integration within the Asia-Pacific region.

“New Zealand values its engagement with these like-minded Latin American countries. Intensifying our relationship with them via the Pacific Alliance provides real opportunities for New Zealand trade.”

The Pacific Alliance was formed in April 2011, with the aim of facilitating regional economic integration in a way that complemented existing bilateral agreements between members.

The current grouping brings together a population of 215 million and combined GDP of more than US$2 trillion. Together Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru account for 35 percent of the GDP of Latin America and the Caribbean, and represent more than half of the region’s trade.

New Zealand already works closely with Mexico, Chile and Peru in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and APEC, and shares with all members the goal of Asia-Pacific economic integration.

“The visit will provide an opportunity to build on the momentum of the Prime Minister’s recent visit to Latin America. Alongside the Alliance there will also be a business summit which will provide a forum to engage with business leaders from the region,” Mr Groser says.
