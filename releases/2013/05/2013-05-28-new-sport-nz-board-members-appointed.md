Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully today appointed former Silver Ferns and Black Ferns manager Jackie Barron to the board of Sport New Zealand.

“Mrs Barron is a seasoned educator and sports administrator with more than a decade of experience at the highest level of netball and women’s rugby,” Mr McCully says.

Mrs Barron managed the Black Ferns during their 2002 Women’s Rugby World Cup victory and has also managed the Silver Ferns, Southern Sting and New Zealand under 21 netball sides.

Crown Forestry Rental Trust Chief Executive and Former Waitangi Tribunal Director Darrin Sykes has also been appointed, stepping in for long-serving board member Rob Fisher who is retiring at the end of July.

“Mr Sykes is an experienced and capable leader who has given almost twenty five years of service to touch rugby as a referee, referee coach and selector,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Sykes has been on the Touch NZ Board of Directors since 1991 and a Trustee for the Regional Sports Trust, Sport Wellington, since 2011.

“My thanks to Mr Fisher who has been an invaluable board member since 2005,” Mr McCully says.
