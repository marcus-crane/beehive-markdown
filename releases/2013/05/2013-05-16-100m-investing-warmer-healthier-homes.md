The Government is investing in a new three-year insulation programme, which will deliver warmer, drier and healthier homes to communities in most need, Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says.

Budget 2013 allocates $100 million of operating funding over three years to the Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes programme, targeting low-income households for home insulation, particularly those families with children and high health needs. It is expected to insulate around 46,000 additional houses.

“Warmer, drier homes provide real benefits to New Zealanders,” Mr Bridges says. “As well as energy efficiency gains, insulating homes reduces health risks such as respiratory illnesses and serious diseases like rheumatic fever.

“Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes will help boost the health and well-being of New Zealanders living in poor housing and is part of the Government’s response to child poverty.”

The Government’s investment will be matched by significant levels of funding from trusts and other third parties. This will see insulation available to those households in most need, at low or no cost.

“The new programme follows the success of the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme, which has seen around 215,000 homes insulated since 2009. When that scheme ends in September, 230,000 households will have benefited.

“Over the past four years, the National-led Government has changed the thinking in relation to home insulation in New Zealand. Now, when buying or renting, many people ask whether the house is insulated,” Mr Bridges says.

Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes will be delivered through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA). Programme details will be announced by EECA in coming weeks.
