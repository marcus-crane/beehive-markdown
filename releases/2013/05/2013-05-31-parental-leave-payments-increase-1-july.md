Parental leave payments will increase from 1 July in line with changes in the average weekly wage, Labour Minister Simon Bridges announced today.

The maximum amount available to eligible employees and the self-employed will increase from $475.16 to $488.17 gross a week.

The minimum parental leave payment for self-employed will also increase, from $135.00 to $137.50 a week gross.

“The increase to parental leave payments matches the 2.7 percent increase in the average weekly wage over the past year,” Mr Bridges says.

Under the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987, parents eligible for the scheme are entitled to up to 14 weeks’ paid leave at a rate calculated on the basis of their average weekly earnings.

The maximum rate is adjusted every year to account for any increase in average weekly earnings.
