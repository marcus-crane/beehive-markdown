New Zealand’s tertiary sector continued to sustain a strong financial performance in 2012 reflecting the increasing size of the Government’s investment, latest figures from the Tertiary Education Commission show.

Indicative financial results show that the publicly-owned tertiary institutions collectively recorded a net surplus (before unusual and non-recurring items) of $157.9 million in 2012, an increase of 43 per cent since 2008.

Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce says the Government invested $2.2 billion in publicly-owned tertiary institutions in the year ending 31 December 2012 – an increase of 13.4 per cent since 2008, despite very tough financial times.

“The increased Government investment and improved revenue performance more generally have resulted in stronger fiscal and education performances across the tertiary sector in the last five years,” Mr Joyce says.

The indicative, unaudited results show that in 2012:

- Total income across the tertiary sector was $4.6 billion, an increase of $104.5 million or 2.3 per cent since 2011 and an increase of $656.4 million or 16.8 per cent since 2008
- ITPs recorded a total income of $1.1 billion, an increase of 3.6 per cent since 2011 and 15.2 per cent since 2008
- Universities recorded a total income of $3.3 billion, an increase of 2.1 per cent since 2011 and 17.4 per cent since 2008
- Government funding of universities has grown 16 per cent since 2008, while funding for ITPs has grown 8.7 per cent and for the Wānanga sector 10.7 per cent
- The sector-wide net surplus before unusual and non-recurring items was $157.9 million, or 3.5 per cent of income.

The effects of the Canterbury earthquakes continue to have an impact on the region’s institutions.  Despite this, the sector remains financially strong.  For example, the university sub-sector overall maintains a net asset base with a carrying value of over $5.9 billion.

“A strong performing tertiary sector plays a vital role in the success of our economy and our society,” Mr Joyce says. 

“The Government is committed to continuing to strengthen both the financial and educational performance of our tertiary sector generally, and in particular, our key publicly-owned tertiary institutions.”
