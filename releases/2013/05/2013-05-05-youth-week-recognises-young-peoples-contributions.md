Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye says everyone should take the time to acknowledge the contributions made by New Zealand’s young people during Youth Week 2013.

Youth Week began yesterday and runs until Sunday 12 May.

“Youth Week is an opportunity to recognise the many young Kiwis making a difference in communities and businesses across the country,” Ms Kaye says.

“It is also a time to think about how we can give more young people opportunities to participate in decision-making and get involved in service in communities at local, regional, national and even international levels.

“Many young people throughout the country tell me that they would like the opportunity to make a greater contribution if someone would give them the chance.

“I am pleased that Youth Week events and activities are organised by young people and youth workers are encouraging young people to get involved, have a say, influence opinions and showcase their creativity and talent.

“Youth Week is the result of thousands of individuals and organisations around New Zealand working together to hold events for young people. It acknowledges the work of youth workers, youth service providers and the many organisations and volunteers that give support throughout the year. There are hundreds of events happening around the country.”

On Thursday this week the Minister will host a function to recognise young Wellington school leaders and announce the Youth MPs selected for Youth Parliament in July.

Youth Week is coordinated by Ara Taiohi, the organisation for people working with young people on behalf of the youth sector, with the support of the Ministry of Youth Development.
