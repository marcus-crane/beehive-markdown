Associate Health Ministers Jo Goodhew and Peter Dunne are welcoming the Health Promotion Agency’s (HPA) new campaign aimed at supporting New Zealanders who want to ‘Ease up on the drink’.

“‘Yeah Nah’ is a uniquely Kiwi expression and enables us to promote messages in an engaging way instead of preaching to Kiwis to drink less,” says Mrs Goodhew, who has delegated responsibility for the HPA.

The latest Ministry of Health survey of New Zealand’s drinking patterns reveals fewer people are drinking and younger people are now drinking more responsibly than five years ago. Minister Dunne has delegated responsibility for alcohol health policy.

“More people are choosing not to drink alcohol and the overall rate of hazardous drinking for the 18- to 24-year-old group has fallen,” says Mr Dunne.

“While this is a step in the right direction, a significant proportion of New Zealanders, ranging from 20 to 25 per cent, still engage in binge drinking resulting in significant costs to individuals, the people around them, the community and the country. That is why this new campaign is so important.”

Hazardous drinking is defined by the Ministry of Health as a drinking pattern that carries a risk of physical or mental harm, or having harmful social effects to the drinker or others.
