Health Minister Tony Ryall says doctors and nurses across the South Island are providing cancer patients with faster, safer cancer treatment thanks to a new software system.

“The new Ministry of Health funded system, called MosaiQ\*, improves the way cancer treatment is delivered and means doctors and nurses can spend more time with patients rather than on paperwork,” says Mr Ryall.

“A patient’s vital signs, diagnosis and treatment are entered into the system and it generates a personalised plan. This system then assists clinicians to monitor the patient’s response to their treatment. It also sends alerts if there are any issues regarding the patient’s treatment.

“For instance, if a laboratory test reveals a patient has a low blood count – which means they shouldn’t have further treatment until their blood count rises – the system sends an alert to reschedule the patient’s treatment. This saves patients from travelling, sometimes for hours, for treatment they can’t have.

“The MosaiQ system includes electronic prescribing to reduce errors, improve medicine safety and reduce medication wastage.

“It also manages appointments, so spaces at treatment clinics are not over-or-under booked. The system even reminds clinicians when it’s time to book diagnostic tests for patients and if special equipment, such as oxygen, is required at their appointments.

“As well as being more efficient, this provides the best possible care for patients. The nurses at Southern District Health Board’s (DHB) oncology and haematology service say the way appointments are scheduled and managed now has led to better experiences for patients.

“This is another example of the type of innovative use of information technology we’re seeing in the health sector and supports the Government priorities for better and faster services for cancer patients,” says Mr Ryall.

The Southern Cancer Network has worked with the South Island DHBs and the National Health IT Board to roll out the system across the South Island’s cancer centres.
