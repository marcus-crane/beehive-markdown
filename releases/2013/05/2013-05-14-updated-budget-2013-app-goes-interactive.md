The Government will launch an update of its Budget app for smartphones and tablets on Thursday with interactive features that allow users to see how much tax they pay and how their tax dollars are spent, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“This is a refresh of the Budget app which was successfully launched last year and is part of the Government’s continuing focus on delivering innovative and better-value public services,” he says.

“The Budget can reach more people when it is digital and accessible.”

The new app features interactive content that allows users to drill down into the Budget spending, and to enter their annual income details to see how much tax they pay and where it is spent on their behalf.

The updated app, called NZ Budget, will include access to the full set of Budget documents including estimates, and will deliver monthly economic updates from Treasury.

“We’ve further reduced the print run for this year’s Budget, which is part of the Government’s continuing strategy to interact with more New Zealanders online,” Mr English says.

The NZ Budget app is available to download free from Apple and Android app stores and further information and links will be available from the Treasury’s website www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/app.

The app will go live with new information when the Budget is delivered at 2pm on Thursday. It includes the Budget speech, press releases, videos, and access to the full set of Budget documents.

Printed copies of key Budget documents will continue to be available from selected bookshops. All documents will also be available at the Treasury’s website when the Budget is delivered in Parliament.
