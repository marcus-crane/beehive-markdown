Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will welcome members of New Zealand’s Chinese communities to Parliament tonight to mark the beginning of the Chinese New Year.

Ms Collins says the function will be a colourful display of Chinese culture and tradition, and will acknowledge the close relationship between New Zealand and the People’s Republic of China.

“Tonight we mark the beginning of the Year of the Snake and recognise the significant contribution our Chinese communities make to New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

“Chinese Kiwis have been industry pioneers and agricultural leaders in our country and continue to strengthen our economy through their entrepreneurial spirit, creativity and innovative ways of thinking.”

Ms Collins says New Zealand’s economic and social priorities are inextricably linked to Asia as we are now more than ever identified as a member of the Asia-Pacific community.

“Last year we celebrated 40 years of diplomatic relations with China and launched the New Zealand Inc China Strategy to strengthen our economic, political and security relationship,” Ms Collins says.

“By continuing engagement with China in 2013 we can grow this mutually beneficial partnership and lay the foundations for enduring prosperity.

“Chinese New Year has always been a wonderful occasion for all New Zealanders to share in Chinese art, culture and tradition and I’m looking forward to celebrating with members of all our ethnic communities tonight.”
