Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman is rejecting claims the NZDF Crib 20 rotation to Bamyan in Afghanistan, which suffered the loss of five lives, was inadequately trained.

The NZ Herald reported today on a critical evaluation report written during CRIB 20’s pre-deployment training.

“The NZDF prides itself on its professional standards. This rotation was assessed by the NZDF as trained to assume full operational duties in Bamyan,” said Dr Coleman.

“The report to which the NZ Herald refers was one of 23 evaluations conducted during pre-deployment training which contributed to a final training report,” he said.

“There was nothing unusual or different about this process, which has been applied on all rotations to help achieve the highest standards.  I have been assured by the NZDF that any gaps identified were addressed before the CRIB took operational responsibility,” said Dr Coleman.

“The Defence Force lost five soldiers during this deployment in two separate insurgent incidents.  The NZDF is still evaluating what took place and the government is waiting to receive the outcome of their inquiries.”

“It is mischievous for Labour to suggest that funding was a factor in pre-deployment training and incorrect for Labour to say funding has compromised troop safety in Afghanistan. NZ efforts in Afghanistan have been well funded.”

“The Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan is well trained and achieves excellent results in a difficult operating environment. The quality of our Defence Force people is internationally recognised.” said Dr Coleman.
