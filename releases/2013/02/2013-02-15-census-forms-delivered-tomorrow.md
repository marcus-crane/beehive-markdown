New Zealand is gearing up for the largest government-run activity this year, the Census on March 5th.

Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says more than 7,000 census collectors will from tomorrow start delivering census forms to every home.

“Included with forms is an internet access code for people to complete them online, which is a secure, quick and easy option.

“The Government has set 10 Better Public Services results, including, *New Zealanders can complete their transactions with the Government easily in a digital environment.* The 2013 Census is an example of how we are doing that by making it easy for people to take part in this important event online.”

Statistics New Zealand expects more than two million census forms will be completed online on Census day.

“If everyone in a household completes forms online then the census collector will receive a text saying they don’t have to return that address to collect them,” Mr Williamson says.

Official census collectors will be wearing a yellow identification badge and carrying a blue census bag.

The 0800 CENSUS helpline is also ready to take calls from the public.
