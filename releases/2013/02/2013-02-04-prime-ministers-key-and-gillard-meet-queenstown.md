Prime Minister John Key will host Australian counterpart Julia Gillard in Queenstown this coming weekend for the annual New Zealand – Australia Prime Ministers’ talks.

“This year marks 30 years since the conclusion of CER, one of the most comprehensive and successful trade agreements in the world.  CER has helped make Australia and New Zealand two of the most integrated economies anywhere,” says Mr Key. 

“With Prime Minister Gillard, I also look forward to discussing the recommendations of our Joint Productivity Commissions’ report into strengthening economic relations between Australia and New Zealand.” 

The Prime Ministers will also discuss cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world, particularly as Australia looks towards assuming presidency of the G20 and a seat on the UN Security Council. Australia and New Zealand’s engagement on defence and security matters, including cooperation on cyber-security, will also be on the agenda.

“I look forward to this annual meeting with Prime Minister Gillard. It provides the opportunity to build on our shared ties and discuss areas where we can engage in a constructive manner.

“It is always a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Gillard to New Zealand. I look forward to making progress on our shared agendas and strengthening the friendship between our respective countries.”
