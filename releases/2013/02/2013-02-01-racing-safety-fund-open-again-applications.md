Applications are now open for the next round of the Racing Safety Development Fund, the Minister of Racing Nathan Guy has announced today.

“The Fund supports important projects around the country that improve racecourse health and safety standards,” says Mr Guy.

“In the past this has included projects like improvements to gates, stables, fences and grandstand repairs.

“There is $572,956 available available in this second round from a total figure of $1 million for 2012/13.

“Improving the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators, and officials is an important priority for the industry. This Fund is there to support these efforts.

“All racing clubs and the racing code bodies are invited to submit applications for funding,” says Mr Guy.

The Minister has written to all racing clubs and the racing code bodies inviting applications to the second round of the 2012/2013 Fund.  Applications must be submitted by 31 March 2013.
