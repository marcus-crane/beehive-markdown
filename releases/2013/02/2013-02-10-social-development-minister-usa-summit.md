Social Development Minister Paula Bennett leaves for Washington DC today where she is the keynote speaker at a home visiting conference next week.

“It’s a real privilege to be asked to talk about the New Zealand experience with home visiting programmes like Family Start,” says Mrs Bennett.

Family Start is New Zealand’s most intensive and expensive home visiting programme designed to help at-risk children and families.

“It’s vital we get this service right for our most vulnerable children.”

“I’ve been determined to ensure the focus of this service is on the protection of children including detecting, preventing and responding to child abuse.”

The *Third National Summit on Quality Home Visiting Programmes* provides an opportunity for delegates to share research, best practice and policy.

“We have some informative experience to share about Family Start and other programmes in New Zealand.”

High caliber presenters at the conference include Joan Lombardi, a leading national and international expert on child development and social policy.

As well as attending and speaking at the conference Minister Bennett will engage with a range of social service providers in Philadelphia and Washington DC.

“As always there are lessons to be learned from other experts and frontline workers about how they deal with difficult social issues and I intend to make the best use of my short time in the US,” says Mrs Bennett.
