Justice Minister Judith Collins has announced New Zealand will support a UK-led initiative to prevent sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations.

“Sexual violence is an abhorrent crime, which too often stands in the way of conflict resolution,” says Ms Collins.

“New Zealand strongly supports initiatives to eliminate sexual violence in situations of armed conflict and post-conflict situations, including in our own region. However this is an issue that must be addressed on an international scale and New Zealand is proud to support UK efforts to do so.”

Ms Collins, who is currently visiting London, met this morning with Senior UK officials leading the initiative. She says New Zealand’s support for the initiative highlights the broad cooperation between the two countries.

“New Zealand continues to support efforts at the United Nations to raise this issue and has called on all states to put in place effective methods to prevent and respond to sexual violence,” Ms Collins says.

“Through our aid development programme New Zealand has actively engaged in Afghanistan and the Pacific, supporting the protection and promotion of women in post-conflict societies.

“There is still much work to be done to ensure that women’s rights are adequately protected, particularly under the most challenging of circumstances.

“The UK is taking a stand against sexual violence at the highest level and New Zealand is pleased to stand alongside one of our most important partners in support of this initiative.”
