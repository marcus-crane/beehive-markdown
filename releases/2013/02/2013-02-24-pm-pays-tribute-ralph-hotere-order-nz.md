Prime Minister John Key today paid tribute to Ralph Hotere, one of New Zealand’s most important artists, who has passed away aged 81. 

“I extend my sympathies and condolences to the family and friends of Mr Hotere, who was one of only a handful of New Zealanders to be granted the country’s highest honour, the Order of New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

“Mr Hotere had a career spanning more than five decades and was a painter, sculptor and collaborative artist.

“His work is represented in major public and private collections both here and overseas.”

Mr Hotere was appointed to the Order of New Zealand in the New Year Honours List, 2012.

“His passing will be deeply mourned by the New Zealand artistic community in particular,” says Mr Key.

“I extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Hotere.”
