Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has condemned today’s reported nuclear test by North Korea, the third since it began testing in 2006.

“North Korea continues to blatantly defy United Nations Security Council resolutions – that is of deep concern and represents a significant threat to peace and security in the region,” Mr McCully says.

“North Korea is in breach of its international obligations and its recent action flies in the face of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, to which New Zealand is strongly committed.

“The international community must send a strong message to North Korea that this path is a dead end. New Zealand stands ready to support timely and significant action by the UNSC in response to this latest test.

“New Zealand continues to urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, and instead to focus its energy on improving the lives of its people and on engaging constructively with the international community,” Mr McCully says.

North Korea’s previous nuclear weapons tests led to UNSC resolutions and sanctions.
