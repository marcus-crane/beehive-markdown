Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced seven appointments to the Archives Council Te Rua Wānanga.

The Council has a statutory role to provide the Minister with independent advice on archives and record keeping issues.

There are four new members who will take up their positions in March 2013:

- Dr Aroha Harris
- Diane Morcom
- Dr Gillian Oliver
- David Reeves

They will join current members Barry Holdaway, George Reedy and Stuart Strachan who have been reappointed for new terms.

“The seven appointees bring a range of experience, skills and perspectives that will ensure the Council has the necessary expertise. I look forward to meeting them all,” said Mr Tremain

“I would like to thank the outgoing members – Richard Nottage, Melwyn Smith, Dame Mary Anne Salmond and Ani Pahuru-Huriwai – for their commitment and service.”
