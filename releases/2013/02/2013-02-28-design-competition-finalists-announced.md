Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has tonight announced the four finalists for the Christchurch urban design competition “Breathe”.

The competition sought innovative medium density housing development designs from any group that included a designer and a property developer. A total of 58 entries from all over the world were received.

“Due to the high calibre of entries the judges decided to name four finalists instead of the planned three,” Mr Williamson says.

Two of the shortlisted concepts are from New Zealand based groups:

- Walker Architecture and Design, and Ceres NZ Development
- Jasmax, Viva Project, Evergreen Realty and Latitude Group Development.

The other two finalists are international entrants:

- From Australia, Ganellen, the University of Technology Sydney and Design King Company Architects
- From Italy, Anselmi Attiani Associated Architects, Cresco Group and Holloway Builders (NZ).

“The four consortiums have each been given $20,000 dollars to develop their concepts. The winning design, which will be announced later this year, will be built across from Latimer Square.”

“This competition will help breathe new life into central Christchurch and show the rest of the country and the world how to make inner cities more desirable places to live,” Mr Williamson says.
