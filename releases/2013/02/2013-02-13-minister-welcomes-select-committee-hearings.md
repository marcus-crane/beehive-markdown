Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the start of the Education and Science Select Committee hearings on the Education Amendment Bill.

The Bill establishes Partnership Schools and clarifies surrender and retention powers for schools. It also supports the provision of early childhood education by enabling the Ministry of Education to assign a National Student Number to children at a much younger age, and clarifies the primary purpose of school Boards of Trustees.

“I would like to thank those individuals and organisations that have taken the time to make submissions. These changes are significant so it’s great that submitters are taking this opportunity to share their views,” says Ms Parata.

The introduction of Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua aims to lift achievement in low decile areas and disadvantaged communities that have been underserved by the education system.

“We already have a number of different types of schools operating in New Zealand, such as state, integrated, single sex, religious, and private schools. Partnership Schools will provide another option for parents giving them more freedom to choose the type of education that best suits their child’s needs.’’

The proposed new powers of surrender and retention are a sensible balance between the needs of schools and the rights of students.

There are currently no specific powers for schools in relation to surrender and retention. The sector asked for guidelines published last year to be strengthened by inclusion in legislation.

“For most schools this won’t mean any change at all to how they manage behaviour and disciplinary processes, nor will it compromise their ability to tackle drug issues. It really confirms current safe practice.’’

School Boards of Trustees play a critical role and their number one priority should be raising student achievement. While many Boards have identified educational matters as their priority, this approach is not consistent across Boards.

“The Bill will make the expectation of Boards clearer. It will ensure student achievement will become the critical consideration when a Board is performing its functions, powers and duties.”

The Bill also allows schools to be more flexible with their time tabling of the school day and will enable the Ministry of Education to assign a National Student Number to children at a much younger age to support the provision of early childhood education.
