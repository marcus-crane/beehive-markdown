Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams today welcomed the news that the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has received the 2013 Spectrum for Mobile Broadband Award at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

“This award demonstrates New Zealand’s ability to set international best practice. Being recognized on the international stage is a tremendous accomplishment and I want to congratulate the dedicated spectrum management team at MBIE for their work,” Ms Adams says.

The GSMA judging panel commented that New Zealand demonstrated the highest achieving strategy in ensuring the transparent and stable long-term ability to meet increasing spectrum demand.

The award also recognised the Government’s support for increased investment in mobile coverage through the Rural Broadband Initiative.

“The growth of mobile broadband is rapidly changing the way we communicate and do business.

“This award reflects the future-focused approach taken in spectrum management, ensuring that New Zealand keeps apace with the world leaders for access to new wireless technologies and innovations.

“The recently announced auction of the 700 MHz band will help confirm our place at the forefront of these developments, ensuring that we have sufficient spectrum available to support these new technologies and services.”

The GSMA is an industry group representing over 800 mobile operators from more than 220 countries, as well as equipment vendors, handset manufacturers, software developers, and internet companies.

Entries for the Spectrum for Mobile Broadband Award were judged on the following criteria:

- Development of regulatory and policy framework that balances government and investor needs
- Demonstrated vision in the management of spectrum resources
- Demonstrated good practice in government transparency and public consultation
- Development and/or implementation of stable long-term spectrum policy
