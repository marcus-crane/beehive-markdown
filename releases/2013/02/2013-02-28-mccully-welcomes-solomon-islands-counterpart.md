Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will meet his counterpart from the Solomon Islands, Foreign Minister Clay Forau, for official talks tomorrow.

“The Solomon Islands is important to New Zealand. We have a major aid and development programme there and have been one of the founding contributors to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI),” Mr McCully says.

“This July marks the 10th anniversary of RAMSI and 10 successful years of contributing to the security and stability of the Solomon Islands. RAMSI is now transitioning from a military operation to a policing mission.

“As RAMSI draws down, our support to the Solomons will increasingly focus on economic growth through the development of critical infrastructure, fisheries, business, education, policing, and law and justice.”

Mr McCully and Mr Forau will discuss the strengthening of economic ties, the Recognised Employer Scheme and how New Zealand can further assist the Solomon Islands recover from the recent tsunami and earthquake that hit the west coast of Santa Cruz Island.
