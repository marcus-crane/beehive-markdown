Associate Professor Hon Luamanuvao Winnie Laban QSO has been appointed a member of the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

She replaces Pele Walker, who is retiring after nearly seven years as an Arts Board member to enable her to focus on other board appointments.

“I am very pleased that Luamanuvao Winnie Laban is available to be an Arts Board member at a time of change for Creative New Zealand,” Mr Finlayson said. “She brings an important Pasifika perspective and also has had a life-long interest and involvement in the arts in New Zealand.”

“I thank Pele Walker for her fine contribution in her seven years of service as an Arts Board member and as the chair of the Pacific Arts Committee.”

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban was appointed Minister of Pacific Island Affairs in 2007. She was a Member of Parliament from 1999 to 2010, when she was appointed Assistant Vice Chancellor (Pasifika) of Victoria University of Wellington.
