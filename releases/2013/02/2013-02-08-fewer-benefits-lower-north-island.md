More than 4800 people went off welfare to take up jobs in Work and Income’s Central region over the last year.

The Central Region covers Kapiti, Horowhenua, Wairarapa, Tararua and the Manawatu.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says the number of people on Unemployment Benefits in the region dropped by 7.8 percent over the year in 2012, down to 3,765.

“The job market has been up and down in the wake of the global recession, but Work and Income staff work hard to identify jobs opportunities with local employers and connect them with people who are ready to work,” she says.

“They’re also looking further afield for job opportunities for some people.”

In August, for example, Downer New Zealand and Work and Income piloted a ‘training and relocation programme’ for the Christchurch rebuild.

People who were willing and able to shift to Canterbury did a pre-employment programme in Palmerston North and were then offered jobs in Canterbury.

The number of young people getting the Unemployment Benefit also dropped, by 13.4 percent to 1,138 over the year in 2012.

Work and Income gets around 1,000 new jobs a week around the country.

In the last year 82,000 New Zealanders went off benefit into work.
