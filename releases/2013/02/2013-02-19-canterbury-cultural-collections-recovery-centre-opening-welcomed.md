Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson has welcomed the opening of the new Air Force Museum extension and the Canterbury Cultural Collections Recovery Centre in Wigram today.

The new Air Force Museum extension was conceived to house aircraft and large objects for conservation but is being used temporarily for the restoration, storage and rehabilitation of heritage and cultural collections affected by the Canterbury earthquakes.  It was opened by His Excellency, the Governor General Lieutenant General Sir Jerry Mateparae in Christchurch today.

“The Canterbury earthquakes had a significant impact on Christchurch’s cultural sector, and put numerous cultural collections at-risk through the possibility of damage or displacement,” Mr Finlayson said.

The government supported the Air Force Museum’s initiative to provide safe and secure premises for the region’s collections, some of which are nationally and internationally important.

Government contributed $2 million to assist with storing and rehabilitating collections, on top of a Christchurch Appeal Trust grant of $1.5 million from the donations contributed from New Zealand and around the world. The remainder of the funding for the total Museum extension had already been raised from philanthropic grants, corporate sponsorship and gaming trusts.

“This was a real partnership for the benefit of the cultural and heritage sectors of the Canterbury region,” Mr Finlayson said.

The centre will enable recovery work such as conservation and cataloguing with the help of expertise from Te Papa National Services in an appropriate climate controlled, secure environment.
