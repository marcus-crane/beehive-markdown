Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has released the report of an independent review into Fire Service Functions and Funding.

The independent Panel led by Hon Paul Swain was set up to review the current provision of fire services, including:

- How to update the mandate of the Fire Service to include the wide range of non-fire activities the Service now undertakes;
- How to ensure that fire services are effectively and efficiently organised;
- Whether the current funding arrangements are stable and equitable.

“The Panel has produced an excellent and wide ranging review. There are a number of good recommendations based on bringing the Fire Service legislation into the 21st century and making the funding system fairer,” says Mr Tremain.

“This report is evolutionary, not revolutionary. At this stage the Government has not committed to or ruled out any recommendations. Before making further decisions it’s important to hear from key stakeholders. Some of the proposals also require a significant amount of further work and analysis.

“All New Zealanders can be proud that we have internationally respected fire services. Both professional fire fighters and volunteers, urban and rural do a fantastic job.

Their roles have expanded to provide a multipurpose emergency and rescue service so it’s important to get the legislation right. I expect to have further decisions outlined by April.

“I would like to thank the Panel members for their hard work which reflects their financial and business skills and depth of experience and knowledge in fire and other emergency services."
