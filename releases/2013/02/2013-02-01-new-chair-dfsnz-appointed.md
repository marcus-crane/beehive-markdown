Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully today named former High Court Judge Warwick Gendall as the next Chair of Drug Free Sport New Zealand.

“Justice Gendall’s legal expertise and experience as a sports administrator will be invaluable to the board of New Zealand’s sports drug agency,” Mr McCully says.

As a barrister, Justice Gendall was involved in a number of sport and drug cases. He also served as Chair of New Zealand Football Council, and has been a FIFA delegate and admissions inspector.

Justice Gendall replaces Michael Heron who was last year appointed Solicitor-General.

“My thanks to outgoing Chair, Mike Heron, who provided strong and effective leadership of the organisation,” Mr McCully says.

Justice Gendall’s term as Chair runs until 31 July 2015.

Former Silver Ferns captain Lesley Rumball has been reappointed to the board.
