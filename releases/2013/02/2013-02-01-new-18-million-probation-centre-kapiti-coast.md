Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has officially opened a new probation centre at Paraparaumu on the Kapiti Coast.

The $1.8 million facility will provide better support for staff and for community offenders trying to steer clear of a return to crime, with a purpose-built Community Work Centre, room for on-site training, and enhanced safety provisions for staff with CCTV and glass interview rooms.

The new probation centre will have 14 staff, who manage 220 offenders in the community, 90 of whom are on community work.

“We have a target of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent every year by 2017, and the new Kapiti Probation Centre will play an important role in achieving that target, as well as leading to 18,500 fewer victims of crime every year,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Probation staff deal with a wide range of offenders. They work extremely hard with these offenders to ensure they comply with their sentences, while giving support to improve their family relationships, get help for alcohol and drug problems, and hold down a job.

“I also want to acknowledge the support provided by local agencies and community groups, who are helping us turn these offenders’ lives around.

“This new probation centre will make a real difference in reducing reoffending, and keeping the public safe.”
