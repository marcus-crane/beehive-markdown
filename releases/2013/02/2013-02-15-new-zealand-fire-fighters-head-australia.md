Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says the deployment today of fire fighters to Australia is a reflection of the strong historic relationship both countries share in helping each other in times of need.

The team of 44 fire fighters being sent to Victoria, is New Zealand’s second largest deployment of rural fire fighters. The team will be base in the Gippsland area for 16 days where they will help fight bush fires that have broken out in the region.

“The benefits of having a reciprocal arrangement are enormous. At the time of the Christchurch earthquake Australia sent a large USAR contingent to assist New Zealand and it’s great to be able to return the favour,” says Mr Tremain.

“The Victorian fire fighters have spent the past two months working hard in extreme heat and having our guys there will give them a well-deserved break.

“The team we are sending are highly skilled, fit and ready to face the challenge ahead of them. I am personally very proud of the commitment shown by our fire fighters and I wish them every success in their efforts.”
