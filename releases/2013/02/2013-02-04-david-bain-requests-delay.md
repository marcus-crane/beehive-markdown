Cabinet has agreed to a formal request from David Bain to delay its consideration of his application for compensation for claimed wrongful conviction and imprisonment, says Justice Minister Judith Collins.

“Mr Bain is not entitled to any compensation as his application falls outside Cabinet guidelines. The process for considering Mr Bain’s application and any decision regarding compensation is entirely at Cabinet’s discretion.

“Cabinet has agreed to put Mr Bain’s application on hold, as he has requested.

“Mr Bain has filed judicial review proceedings which will lead to further delay,” Ms Collins said.

No further comment will be made while this matter is before the courts.
