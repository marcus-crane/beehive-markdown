Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced that the new funding round for the Support for Volunteering Fund is now open.

“The Support for Volunteering Fund provides over $500,000 each year to projects and organisations that promote and support volunteering in New Zealand,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“The funding is divided between Volunteering New Zealand, regional volunteer centres and selected projects in the volunteer sector. The focus for the current funding round is Māori, Pacific and ethnic community projects.

“We are looking to fund projects promoting information sharing, networking and development of resources that support Māori, Pacific and ethnic volunteering.

“We’re also interested in projects responding to specific cultural values and needs or encouraging, recognising and promoting volunteers as community leaders.”

Organisations applying for funds must have legal entity status, appropriate governance and management structures and processes in place and be able to show they have the capability to successfully achieve the project outcomes proposed.

“Projects must promote, support or strengthen volunteering in the community, or build volunteering capacity and capabilities,” Mrs Goodhew said.

Applications to the fund must be submitted by 4.00pm on Wednesday 1 May 2013. Community Advisors in Department of Internal Affairs offices across the country are available to help with applications.
