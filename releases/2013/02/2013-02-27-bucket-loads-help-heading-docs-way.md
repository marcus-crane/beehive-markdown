Minister of Conservation Dr Nick Smith has welcomed the opening of the first buckets of 45,000 litres worth of paint provided by Dulux under a new $1.5 million conservation partnership announced today.

“It’s fantastic to have Dulux on board to help DOC with the challenge of maintaining our 973 backcountry huts. This will enable DOC to accelerate its maintenance programme and ensure the 300,000 New Zealanders and visitors who use these huts each year continue to enjoy quality accommodation,” Dr Smith says.

“Bringing business partners on board allows DOC to do more in tight financial times. The bonus is that Dulux will be throwing its marketing muscle into the cause with a nationwide campaign promoting our backcountry hut network and further to this will also make a contribution towards a biodiversity sponsorship programme in the future.

“This partnership is a vote of confidence in Dulux paints and its woodcare products as no buildings in New Zealand face the range of harsh climatic conditions that DOC’s network of huts do.

“It’s also another great example of the benefits of forming conservation partnerships with passionate businesses and follows hard on the heels of the first rare bird releases on the weekend stemming from DOC’s alliance with Air New Zealand. I will be challenging more businesses to join us in looking after those places and wildlife that make New Zealand special.”
