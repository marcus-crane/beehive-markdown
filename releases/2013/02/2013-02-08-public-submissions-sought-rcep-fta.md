The government is inviting submissions on upcoming negotiations for the 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Free Trade Agreement.

In November 2012, Prime Minister John Key joined other leaders from Australia, the 10 ASEAN states, China, India, Korea and Japan, to launch the RCEP Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations.

“This is a significant development for New Zealand which will help us deepen our links with Asia. Asia is critical for New Zealand’s future as a source of growth, markets, investment and talent. Ultimately these agreements are about creating long-term wealth and employment for New Zealanders,” Mr Groser says.

“This allows New Zealand to be a part of a major trade initiative in the dynamic East Asian region. The countries which have committed to RCEP represent markets of more than 3 billion people, almost US$20 trillion in combined GDP and around 27 per cent of world trade.”

RCEP will cover trade in goods, trade in services, investment, economic and technical cooperation, intellectual property, competition, dispute settlement and other issues.

As New Zealand prepares for the launch of RCEP FTA negotiations it is important that our negotiators know and understand the views and interests of New Zealanders. Investors, exporters and importers of goods and services, non-government organisations and individuals are invited to make submissions.
