Public feedback is being sought as part of a review of the 2007 amendments to enduring powers of attorney provisions, Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

“The Ministry of Social Development has developed an online questionnaire and will be holding regional meetings to receive feedback on the effectiveness of the amendments made in 2007 to the enduring power of attorney provisions in the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act,” says Mrs Goodhew.

An enduring power of attorney is a legal instrument that allows an individual to choose someone they trust to act on their behalf and in their best interest should they lose the capacity to manage their own affairs.

“The 2007 amendments were made to increase protections for people who can no longer manage their personal and property affairs,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“This included strengthening witnessing requirements for those setting up an enduring power of attorney and ensuring that those acting on behalf of someone else are not able to benefit themselves or anyone other than the person they are acting for.

“I am very keen to hear people’s views on how well the changes made in 2007 are working and whether any more improvements are needed.

“I encourage anyone who has feedback to offer to fill out the questionnaire or attend a public meeting to have their say.”

As part of the review process the Ministry of Social Development and a number of advocacy organisations are working to increase awareness of the benefits of having an enduring power of attorney.

“The Ministry has contributed $75,000 to Age Concern’s publicity campaign on this important issue,” says Mrs Goodhew.
