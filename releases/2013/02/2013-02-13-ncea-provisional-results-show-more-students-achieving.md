Education Minister Hekia Parata says provisional NCEA results show more students are achieving, particularly Pasifika students.

The provisional results show that 82.7 per cent of students achieved NCEA Level 2 last year compared to 81.9 per cent in 2011. An increase of 6.7 per cent since 2008.

The results show a marked improvement for Pasifika students with 67.3 per cent achieving NCEA Level 2 last year, up nearly three per cent on 64.4 per cent in 2011.

"This is significant and we celebrate Pasifika students for this. Parents, principals, teachers and the wider community have also played a part in this increase."

Importantly, the provisional results show more students are staying at school longer with 38,484 students achieving NCEA Level 2 last year, compared to 38,058 in 2011.

The number of Pasifika students also increased with 3,065 students achieving NCEA 2 last year compared to 2581 in 2011.

“Our Government has an unrelenting focus on lifting achievement for all students. Evidence shows that having NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification allows better opportunities for further education, employment, health outcomes and an improved quality of life generally.’’

The results also show a small improvement in NCEA Level 1 with 77.6 per cent of students achieving, up from 77.3 per cent in 2011. Pasifika students achieved better results with 60.6 per cent passing last year, up from 58.9 per cent in 2011.

Disappointingly the provisional figures show that Māori students continue to leave school before this critical NCEA Level 2 stage.

“I encourage all parents, whānau, iwi, and schools to work together with us to help increase Māori student participation in NCEA Level 2.

"Our Government is committed to 85 per cent of all 18 year-olds achieving NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification in 2017.

“If we continue as we are we will have around 47,990 18 year olds achieving NCEA Level 2 in 2013. In order to reach our target we need around 1,280 more 18 year olds to achieve NCEA Level 2 this year and we must all work towards that.

"We want all our kids to leave schools with the qualification they need to succeed in a modern society. Learning is earning."
