Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy has announced that experienced director Alison Paterson will oversee the establishment of a new Crown company to invest in irrigation.

The new company, which is to be established by 1 July, will act as a bridging investor for regional water infrastructure development, with $80 million to be set aside in Budget 2013.

“I’m pleased to have people of high quality and balance to work on what is a critical area of New Zealand’s growth,” says Mr Guy.

“Well-designed storage and irrigation infrastructure has the potential to deliver a major boost to our primary industries and support new jobs, which will have a flow-on effect for all New Zealanders. If current proposals are advanced there could be another 420,000 hectares of irrigated land available over time.

“It will also be better for the environment, as these schemes will lead to more efficient water use, and can provide for the replenishment of aquifers and the restoration of stream and river flows.

“Setting up a commercially driven Crown company and partnering with private investors is a unique approach to the challenge of getting regional-level infrastructure built.

“These people offer a balance of commercial and governance expertise, and a practical understanding of large infrastructure projects that will ensure the company gets off on the right footing.

“A number of proposals for regional-level water storage and irrigation schemes are nearing the stage where they will be ready to be presented to investors. The Government’s role is that of an enabler, acting as a bridging and minority investor.”

The Establishment board’s term will be 1 March to 30 June 2013
