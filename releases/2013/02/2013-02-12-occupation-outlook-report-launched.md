Students and parents will be able to make more informed career and study choices following today’s release of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s new Occupation Outlook report.

The report, which provides a snapshot of the current state of 40 of New Zealand’s most common occupations and their likely employment prospects, has been welcomed by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce.

“There has been a shortage of readily available demand-side information on the short-to-medium term outlook for occupations in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Occupation Outlook report addresses those information gaps. It was developed by MBIE in collaboration with Careers New Zealand with information from businesses and industries, and a range of other stakeholders.

“The report will be helpful for young people wanting to make more informed career choices.  Used well, it will lessen the likelihood of people ending up in jobs poorly matched to their skills and qualifications. It will also be a great resource for their parents, employers, training organisations, tertiary institutes and careers advisors.

Of the 40 occupations investigated, those with the greatest job prospects include engineering professionals, ICT business and systems analysts, electricians and nurses.

The report comprises two-page summaries on 40 occupations and includes information on the career path and income prospects of that particular occupation, what skills and qualifications are needed, registration and licensing requirements, and which tertiary institutes and ITOs provide the prerequisite study courses and required training.

This report complements the *Moving on up - What young people earn after their tertiary education report that was released last month and showed that* those studying in in-demand areas earn the most.

**“**The Government is continuing to work to provide better information that will assist students in making informed choices about their study options and careers,” Mr Joyce says.
