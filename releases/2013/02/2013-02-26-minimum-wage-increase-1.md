Labour Minister Simon Bridges today announced the minimum wage is to rise to $13.75.

The current wage rate is $13.50.

The training and new entrants’ minimum wages will increase from $10.80 to $11, which is 80 per cent of the adult minimum wage.

“Setting these wage rates represents a careful balance between protecting low paid workers and ensuring jobs are not lost as the economic recovery gains pace,” says Mr Bridges.

“The Government is firmly focussed on growing the economy and boosting incomes.  Through our Business Growth Agenda we are creating opportunities to help grow more jobs in New Zealand, for New Zealanders.”

The new minimum wage rates will come into effect on 1 April.
