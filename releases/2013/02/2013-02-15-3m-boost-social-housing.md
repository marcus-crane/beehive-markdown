Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced Government grants of $3.11 million have been given to help build 26 new social housing units in Auckland, Nelson and Canterbury.

“These are the first grants from the Government’s new $104 million Social Housing Fund to assist families with acute housing needs,” Dr Smith says.

“It is part of a deliberate strategy to expand the community provision of social housing to complement that provided by Housing New Zealand. These 26 units are targeted at people on low incomes and those with special needs.”

The successful community housing organisations are VisionWest Community Trust in West Auckland, the Nelson Tasman Housing Trust and ComCare Charitable Trust in Canterbury.

These organisations will contribute $3.87 million of their own money, resulting in nearly $7 million in new housing developments.

“The Social Housing Fund is part of a broad programme of reforms to increase the quantity, quality and affordability of homes for New Zealand families.

“It is not a magic bullet, but alongside our initiatives to free up land supply, reduce costs of infrastructure, improve productivity and reduce compliance costs it will help deliver more and better housing.”

The Social Housing Unit, which is responsible for allocating grants from the Social Housing Fund, will open a further funding round later this month.
