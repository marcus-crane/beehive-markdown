Around 85,000 more people with high health needs are now receiving extra support through the Government’s Care Plus programme compared to five years ago.

“This year we are investing $50 million in the Care Plus programme – more than double what was spent in 2007,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The extra funding has allowed more people with long term conditions, such as diabetes or acute mental health needs, to receive extra support, coordinated through their general practice team, to better manage their health.

“People enrolled in Care Plus develop a personalised plan with their GP and nurse which includes their health and wellbeing goals. They have regular follow ups and are supported to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. This can include subsided access to dietary and podiatry services and physical activity programmes.”

Mr Ryall says feedback from GPs, nurses and patients about Care Plus is very positive.

“GPs and nurses tell me many patients with diabetes, who in the past have struggled with their condition, now have better control of their diabetes thanks to the additional support they can provide through the Care Plus programme. As a result of the extra support their patients have a better understanding of their condition, are managing their insulin levels well and have made changes to their lifestyle including eating healthier and exercising more frequently.”

There are now around 190,000 people benefiting from the Care Plus programme.
