Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee today announced the appointment of Russell Watson, Maxine Moana-Tuwhangai and Belinda Vernon to the Maritime New Zealand board, and the appointment of Howard Broad as a Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission.

“The calibre of the appointees’ skills and experience means their respective organisations will be well served over the next few years,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mr Watson and Ms Moana-Tuwhangai begin their terms on 28 February while Ms Vernon begins her term on 1 May.

Russell Watson is based in Auckland and has more than 30 years’ experience in the New Zealand shipping industry, mainly as managing director of NYKCool New Zealand Ltd and its predecessor company.

Maxine Moana-Tuwhangai is based in the Waikato and is of Tainui and Maniapoto descent. Ms Moana-Tuwhangai is a chartered accountant, and has previously held senior finance roles at Tainui Group Holdings and Environment Waikato.

Belinda Vernon is from Auckland and has extensive experience in the shipping industry as an accountant and senior manager; she has also acted as company secretary in a number of her positions.

“I would like to acknowledge the work of outgoing Maritime NZ board members Michael Ludbrook and David Morgan whose terms ended in October last year but agreed to continue on the Board until new appointments could be made, and Kenneth Gilligan whose term expires on 30 April 2013,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I would like to thank David Morgan who served over 10 years on the Maritime NZ Board, part of that time as deputy chair; Ken Gilligan who also served the board for 10 years; and Michael Ludbrook who served seven years.

“These three board members served during a period in which important decisions were made about the future direction of Maritime New Zealand and in which the organisation faced a number of significant challenges.”

Mr Broad begins his term as a Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission on 1 March. Mr Broad has more than 35 years’ experience in the New Zealand Police force, and was Commissioner of the New Zealand Police from 2006 to 2011. Mr Broad is currently the chair of the Turn Your Life Around Trust (a not-for-profit organisation providing youth development services).

“I would also like to welcome Howard Broad and acknowledge the service of Bryan Wyness to the Transport Accident Investigation Commission, who passed away in July 2012.”
