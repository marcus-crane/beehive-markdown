Taranaki cancer patients and their families will have better support thanks to the appointment of a dedicated cancer nurse who will coordinate and streamline patient care.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the specialist nurse, who starts work at Taranaki District Health Board (DHB) today, is one of 40 dedicated cancer nurses who are expected to be working in public hospitals throughout the country by the end of May.

“The Government is investing $4 million a year to ensure every DHB has at least one full time dedicated cancer nurse, as part of its commitment to provide better and faster cancer services,” says Mr Ryall.

“The specialist nurses will act as a single point of contact so patients and their families no longer have to deal with multiple people from different parts of the health service.

“Nursing has warmly welcomed this new role, which will vastly improve the treatment experience for patients by reducing delays, stress and duplication.

“This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. DHBs have all carefully considered how best to tailor the role to achieve the biggest benefit for their patients.”

“In Taranaki, the nurse will coordinate care for patients in the area who are diagnosed with cancer, and work with doctors and other health professionals to ensure patients receive seamless treatment in the fastest possible time.”

A national clinical nurse lead will be appointed later this month to support the cancer nurses and promote service improvements.

The funding of cancer nurse coordinators was announced in Budget 2012 as part of a $33 million funding package aimed at further improving cancer services.
