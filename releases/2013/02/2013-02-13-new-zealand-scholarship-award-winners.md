Education Minister Hekia Parata today congratulated the New Zealand Scholarship Award winners for 2012.

Almost 8000 students participated in New Zealand Scholarship exams last year, with 2344 students achieving a scholarship.

“This year’s award winners should feel very proud of what they have achieved. New Zealand Scholarship achievement is a reflection of the great work done by students, teachers, parents and whānau throughout the school year to ensure educational success”.

“Winners also receive a monetary award and over the next three years these students will receive a total of almost $3.7 million towards their further study”.

“This financial contribution will provide a great boost for these students and will help them to succeed in their tertiary studies and reach new heights of achievement – in turn setting them on a path to success for the rest of their lives”.

Minister Parata also offered congratulations to the students that achieved Premier Awards, Outstanding Scholar Awards and Top Subject Scholarship Awards.

“These winners represent less than 2 per cent of those students who attempted scholarship – they are the best of the best and their achievements are testament to the motivation and skill required to achieve at the very highest level”.

“I am confident that this year’s New Zealand Scholarship Award winners are a group of young people who will continue to build on their success and will contribute to New Zealand’s prosperity in the future”.

A full list of award winners, by name, can be found on the NZQA website:
