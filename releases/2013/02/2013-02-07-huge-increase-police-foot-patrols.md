Police Minister Anne Tolley says that frontline foot patrols have risen by 70 per cent in the past year, as Police increase their focus on crime prevention to make our communities safer.

The total number of Police foot patrols increased by 28,855 in 2012, rising from 40,918 in 2011 to 69,773 last year.

“Police are taking a back to the future approach, by having more officers on the beat to tackle and prevent crime,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Staff are being deployed much more strategically, in areas and at times when Police know there is a greater risk of crime taking place.

“This smarter approach, with the right people in the right places at the right times, means officers are more visible and better able to prevent crime.

“It also sends a clear warning to criminals.

“In the last two fiscal years we have seen crime rates drop by 5.9 per cent and seven per cent respectively.

“That translates as 47,438 fewer crimes and thousands fewer victims of crime.

“The Police are well on course to meet the Better Public Service targets which will see a reduction in the total recorded crime rate by 15 per cent, the recorded violent crime rate by 20 per cent, the youth crime rate by 5 per cent and the reoffending rate by 25 per cent by 2017.

“The huge increase in foot patrols, Neighbourhood Policing Teams, the Prevention First Strategy and the 600 additional frontline officers delivered by the National-led Government are all playing a part and I expect this fantastic work to continue.”
