Health Minister Tony Ryall visited the newly reopened St Martins Pharmacy in Christchurch today where he announced over 45,000 New Zealanders have benefited from new and more accessible medicines in the past six months.

“Since 2009, 83 new medicines have been added to the community pharmaceutical schedule and become government-funded and access to 84 medicines has been widened,” said Mr Ryall

“This number will continue to increase with $10 million being invested in new medicines this financial year.

Over the last three years, an average of 132,000 New Zealanders, many with serious medical conditions including cancer, whooping cough and osteoporosis, benefit from the new and more accessible medicines each year.

“Helping New Zealanders get the medication they need is a priority for this government and we are committed to expanding the medicines available.  

Since 2008, funding for community and cancer medicine has increased by $180 million – the total budget is now over $780 million.
