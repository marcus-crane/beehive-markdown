Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand will assist with the emergency response to yesterday’s earthquake and tsunami in the Solomon Islands.

“New Zealand has made $200,000 available for humanitarian supplies and support to the Solomon Islands Government assessment teams,” Mr McCully says.

“The earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which hit the remote Temotu Province, caused damage to a number of homes, and sadly there are reports that lives have been lost.

“Due to the remoteness of the area it might take some time for the Solomon Islands Government and relief agencies to gain a full picture of the damage,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealand will consider additional assistance in due course.
