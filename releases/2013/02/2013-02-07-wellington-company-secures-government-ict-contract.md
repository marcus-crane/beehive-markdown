Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain announced today that Wellington company, SilverStripe, has secured the contract for a single web platform for government agencies.

“A web platform is the underlying system which allows an agency to create and deliver high quality websites for New Zealanders. Creating a single web platform is part of the Government's better public services initiative and will bring savings to taxpayers,” says Mr Tremain.

“Having one common platform will enable government departments to share and reuse website features. This will improve consistency, efficiency and lower costs.

“This common capability shows potential savings of $50,000 per web project procurement. On its own it’s not a big amount but when spread over the whole of government we’re looking at estimated savings of over $500,000 per year.

“It’s great news that an integral part of the Government Common Web services initiative has gone to a New Zealand company. Another New Zealand company, Revera, will manage technical infrastructure, using the Government’s Infrastructure as a Service.”
