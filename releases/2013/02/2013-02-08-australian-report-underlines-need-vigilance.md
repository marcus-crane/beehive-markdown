Sport Minister Murray McCully says the Australian Crime Commission report on Organised Crime and Drugs in Sport needs to be taken seriously on this side of the Tasman.

“I have asked Sport New Zealand, High Performance Sport NZ and Drug Free Sport NZ to report back to me on the implications of the Australian Crime Commission report released yesterday,” Mr McCully says.

“I have asked them to consult with the New Zealand Olympic Committee and any other relevant bodies in compiling their report.

“While the Australian report does not make any accusations about New Zealand athletes, it would be unwise for New Zealand to ignore its findings given the strong level of engagement between sporting teams from our two countries.”
