Police and Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Christchurch Central Police station.

Built at a cost of $22 million, the new facility replaces the previous station, which had to be vacated due to earthquake risks.

It will accommodate up to 500 Police staff, who will be sharing the building with 40 Corrections staff.

“I’m delighted that the Police, who have been working in makeshift conditions, now have new, modern and professional surroundings,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They work incredibly hard and have made a big difference to the lives of Cantabrians. Our Police deserve to have such a great facility, and I want to thank them for their efforts since the earthquake.

“It’s also good to see a greater collaboration with Corrections, which will have staff in the same building.

“This represents a new and closer way of working, which makes sense given the shared goals of safer communities, less crime, less reoffending and fewer victims of crime.

“Construction only got under way on the new station in May last year, so the teams involved in the design and build deserve praise for making this happen in such a short space of time.

“The future is really exciting for Police and Corrections in Christchurch. We have the right building and the right people, and I wish them every success.”
