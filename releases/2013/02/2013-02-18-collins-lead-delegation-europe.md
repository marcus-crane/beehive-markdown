Justice and Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins leaves tomorrow for Geneva, London and Vienna to meet with political counterparts and United Nations officials.

In Geneva, Ms Collins will present the Government’s latest report on New Zealand’s progress in tackling racial discrimination and inequality to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

“As an active member of the Convention, I look forward to discussing with the committee how New Zealand is actively addressing challenges around racial discrimination and ethnic inequalities,” Ms Collins says.

“Like all countries, we are not immune to such issues, but New Zealand values diversity and prides itself on being an inclusive society.”

Ms Collins will also attend meetings with justice sector officials and political counterparts in London and Vienna, including the Austrian Minister for Justice and the UK Secretary of State for Justice to discuss contemporary justice issues.

Ms Collins will discuss what New Zealand is doing to address corruption and anti-money laundering, and the sexual abuse of children online, including our founding membership of the Global Alliance set up to combat this serious issue, in which both the UK and Austria are participating.

“Many of these issues are global, so a global approach is needed to make sure offenders are effectively prosecuted and that victims receive the support they need,” Ms Collins says.

During her trip to Vienna, Ms Collins will meet with the Executive Secretary for the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to discuss key aspects of the Government’s strategy to strengthen mechanisms for fighting organised crime.

“New Zealand has an on-going commitment to a number of UNODC’s programmes for tackling organised crime in the Asia Pacific region relating to terrorism threats, drug trafficking and trans-national organised crime,” Ms Collins says.

In London, Ms Collins will present awards to members of the Metropolitan Police Service who helped with the Canterbury Earthquake response in 2011. The 10 recipients will be recognised at a ceremony at New Zealand House hosted by the Acting High Commissioner.

“These awards recognise the incredible spirit, actions and outstanding contribution of those who worked in Christchurch during the 2011 state of emergency,” Ms Collins says.
