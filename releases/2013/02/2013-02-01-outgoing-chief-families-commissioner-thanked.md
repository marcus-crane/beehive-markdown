Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has acknowledged Carl Davidson’s contribution to families as Chief Families Commissioner.

Carl Davidson steps down from the position he has held since August 2010 to focus on his own family and work in Christchurch.

Mrs Bennett says Carl Davidson has done an outstanding job as Chief Families Commissioner, bringing a level of professionalism to the organisation and elevating its role publicly.

“I thank him for his valuable contribution and wish him well in the future.”

In the interim, current Families Commissioner Belinda Milnes will be stepping into the role of Chief Families Commissioner and Chair of the Board, until a permanent replacement is appointed.

Over four years a minimum of $14.2 million of the $32.48 million funding the Families Commission receives is being reprioritised to set up a new Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit (SuPERU).

“This new unit will provide the independent monitoring, evaluation and research this country needs,” says Mrs Bennett.

“It will also audit social sector programmes and initiatives, a job which is now largely undertaken by government departments,” she says.
