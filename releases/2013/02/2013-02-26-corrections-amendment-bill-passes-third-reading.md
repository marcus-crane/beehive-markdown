Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says a Bill which improves prison safety and security has passed its third reading in Parliament.

The Corrections Amendment Bill improves drug testing and searching procedures in prisons, and makes it an offence to “waterload”, or drink a lot of liquid, to attempt to dilute a drug test.

The Bill also strengthens contraband regulations, to make tobacco and smoking items illegal on prison grounds.

“This legislation reinforces the smoking ban in prisons, which has been a great success in delivering a healthier work environment for staff, and for prisoners,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It also simplifies the procedures around the strip searching of prisoners, which is essential for recovering weapons and contraband.

“Our Corrections staff are completely focused on delivering a 25 per reduction in reoffending each year by 2017.

“We are now enabling them to do that with much clearer procedures in a safer and healthier workplace.”
