Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse today launched [www.nzstudywork.com](http://www.nzstudywork.com), an exciting new website designed to provide advice and support for international students in New Zealand.

“The new website provides international students with a ‘one-stop shop’ where they can get information about their employment rights and responsibilities, health and safety in the workplace, work conditions attached to student visas and settlement resources,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“The export education sector contributes over $2 billion a year to the New Zealand economy and the government has set an ambitious target to double that contribution by 2025.”

“To meet this target, and to ensure that New Zealand remains an attractive destination for international students, we need to constantly be looking to improve on the support and service we offer those students.”

“The government has already implemented a number of practical measures to encourage students to come to New Zealand. Recent changes to health screening will cut costs and red tape for students, and work rights have been extended to English language students who attend quality education providers in Canterbury.”

“These sorts of initiatives – combined with recent improvements in processing times for student visas – will make a huge difference in growing our export education industry,” says Mr Woodhouse.
