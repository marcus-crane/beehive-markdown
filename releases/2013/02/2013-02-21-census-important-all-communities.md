Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says extensive efforts are being made to reach ethnic communities ahead of the upcoming census on March 5th.

Census data is used extensively in central and local Government planning, including to help determine funding for district health boards.

“Statistics New Zealand has a team of 19 community liaison advisers working to promote the importance of census within Asian, Māori, Pacific Island and other ethnic communities, which have traditionally been undercounted.

“We need to ensure we reach people that don’t necessarily have English as a first language and that they know the census is for everyone, whether they are a citizen, a resident or just here on holiday,” Mr Williamson says.

The 2013 Census Community Liaison Team has connected with more than 1,000 key people in ethnic communities, who are able to endorse and promote census through a wide range of networks.

“Having people who know these communities and who are able to speak the language has certainly opened doors,” Mr Williamson says.

Census fact sheets are available in 27 languages and the 0800 CENSUS helpline has operators who can provide help in seven languages.
