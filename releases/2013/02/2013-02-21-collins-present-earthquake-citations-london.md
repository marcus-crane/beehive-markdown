During her visit to London next week, Judith Collins will present New Zealand Police citations to members of the United Kingdom’s Metropolitan Police Service who helped with the Canterbury Earthquake response in 2011.

“The 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Citation is a unique award that recognises the unwavering spirit, actions and outstanding contribution of those who worked on the ground in Christchurch during the 2011 state of emergency,” Ms Collins says.

“On behalf of the New Zealand Government, I will acknowledge and thank the distinguished recipients for their extraordinary efforts during a time of great risk and uncertainty.

“Experts in Disaster Victim Identification (DVI), the members of the Metropolitan Police worked closely with New Zealand Police and DVI specialists on the harrowing task of identifying earthquake victims.

“I personally visited the DVI teams at the mortuary and saw them working in an incredibly humane and professional manner.”

The awards ceremony will be hosted by New Zealand’s Acting High Commissioner at New Zealand House, London on Monday 25 February at 3pm UK time.
