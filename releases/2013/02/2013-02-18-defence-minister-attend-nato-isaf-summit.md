Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman is attending the NATO-ISAF summit in Brussels this week to outline New Zealand’s on going commitments in Afghanistan.

“It is a useful opportunity to set out New Zealand’s small but valuable contribution to the international operation in Afghanistan after the departure of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in April,” said Dr Coleman.

The Defence Minister is scheduled to meet the Afghanistan Defence Minister, meet the new ISAF Commander, General Joe Dunford, and hold a series of other bilateral meetings.

Dr Coleman is also visiting Paris to meet the French Defence Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, their Chief of Defence Force, and other French military contacts.

He will also visit London for a range of Defence and State Services engagements.

Dr Coleman will return via New York where he will be holding meetings with United Nations heads of missions in support of New Zealand’s Security Council campaign. 

Dr Coleman leaves this evening.
