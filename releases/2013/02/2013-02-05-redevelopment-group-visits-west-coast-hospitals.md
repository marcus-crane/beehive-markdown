Fast tracking the rebuild of Grey Base Hospital in Greymouth is now underway with the inaugural meeting of the West Coast Hospital Redevelopment Group at the hospital last week says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The Group brings the West Coast DHB, Ministry of Health and Treasury together in a collaborative approach that saves time and money,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The members also contribute in-depth understanding and experience of the unique challenges of providing health services in remote and rural settings.

“West Coast DHB Chair Dr Paul McCormack tells me he is pleased for the opportunity to work with the expert team which is aiming for a result for the West Coast people and the DHB this year.

Last week the Group toured the Grey and Buller hospital sites and received a briefing on the work done previously on the future of the West Coast Health System.

The partnership group will be working hard to complete the reports required by the end of April 2013 for the Government and Capital Investment Committee to consider and make their decisions.
