Minister of Statistics Maurice Williamson says Statistics New Zealand is on track with the delivery of millions of internet access codes and paper forms for the March 5th Census.

More than 7,000 census collectors have been walking, driving and even boating to reach every home in New Zealand to deliver forms.

“Collectors will be delivering right up to census day, so there is no need to worry if you don’t have your forms yet.”

“The results of the 2013 Census will have a tangible impact on people, as data collected is used to allocate billions of dollars of funding in areas such as health and transport. That’s why it’s compulsory for every person who is in New Zealand on census day to take part,” Mr Williamson says.

It’s expected more than two million census forms will be completed online on March 5th.

“I encourage everyone to use the online option, as it’s secure, quick and easy.”
