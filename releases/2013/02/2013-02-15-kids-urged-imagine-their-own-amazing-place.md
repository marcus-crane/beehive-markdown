Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the children of Christchurch have a unique opportunity to help develop part of the new central city through the Amazing Place playground competition.

Competition packs have been distributed to every Canterbury school and early childhood centre, and schools have already begun registering to take part in the project, which has the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) as its principal sponsor.

There are separate competitions for different age groups.

Younger children are invited to design a playground they would consider the most ‘Amazing Place,’ while older children have been invited to work in a team to come up with a project for the new city centre.

Mr Brownlee says the young people of Canterbury are being given a blank canvas and asked to tap into their imagination.

“This is a fantastic way for the next generation to take ownership of a piece of Christchurch’s multi-billion dollar redevelopment,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The children of greater Christchurch have been through an awful lot, and been exceptionally brave and resilient over the past two years.

“Having endured so much they deserve a real stake in the new Christchurch – an amazing place they can call their own.”

Winning designs in the playground competition will be submitted to the concept designers as the project gets underway.

Winners will be announced in the third term of the school year and will be competing not only to have their concepts become reality but also prizes courtesy of the BNZ.

“I want to acknowledge and thank the BNZ for stepping up and helping make this important project happen,” Mr Brownlee says.
