Prior to her appointment to the Bench, Judge Wainwright was a partner in Buddle Findlay. She was appointed as a Māori Land Court Judge in 2000 and served on the Waitangi Tribunal for ten years, including six years as the Deputy Chairperson. Since 2010, Judge Wainwright has sat on the District Court Bench in Wellington.
