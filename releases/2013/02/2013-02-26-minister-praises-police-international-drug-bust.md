Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated Police and OFCANZ for their involvement in an international operation which has kept $7 million of methamphetamine out of the country and off New Zealand’s streets.

Two shipments totalling 6.6 kg of methamphetamine were seized in Canada before they could be transported here, and as part of the operation a number of arrests have been made by New Zealand Police.

In addition, there have been raids on cannabis growing houses in Auckland which recovered over 600 cannabis plants.

“The Police, and all of the agencies involved, deserve praise for their hard work and dedication in targeting and taking action against this drug syndicate,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Methamphetamine is a horrendous drug, and this bust has the potential to stop many lives being destroyed.

“The vigilance of our two countries has made our streets safer - there is no place in our communities for drugs.

“Criminals should be warned that the Police, with the help of international co-operation, are intent on smashing the supply and distribution of drugs.

“A jail cell will be the only reward for anyone stupid enough to get involved.”
