Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says a Bill which will enable prisons to operate more effectively has passed its second reading.

The Bill proposes improvements to drug testing and searching procedures, which will lead to enhanced safety and security.

It will also make it an offence for a prisoner to “waterload” prior to a drug test.

“We are using this Bill to make tobacco and smoking items illegal on prison grounds, which will strengthen current regulations,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This will be addressed in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) which I will introduce at the Committee Stage.

“The Smoke Free Environments Act will also be amended by the SOP to ensure that legislation fits with the smoking ban in prisons, to protect the health of prison officers and prisoners.

“There is no way we are backing away from the smoking ban in prisons. It has been highly successful, and these changes to the Bill clearly show our commitment to a policy which has delivered a better, healthier and safer workplace for staff, and for prisoners.”
