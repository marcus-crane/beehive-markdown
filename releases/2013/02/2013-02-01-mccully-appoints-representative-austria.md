Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named career diplomat Deborah Geels as New Zealand’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office in Vienna and Ambassador to Austria.

“The focus of the Permanent Mission is advancing New Zealand’s nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation interests, particularly in relation to the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Geels has previously served in Beijing, Geneva and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s consular and north Asia divisions.

As Ambassador to Austria, she will also be accredited to Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia.
