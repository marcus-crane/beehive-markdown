State Services Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman is urging government agencies to self-nominate for the 2013 Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ) Gen-i Public Sector Excellence Awards.

“Public servants are rising to the challenge of delivering better public services. We need to recognise innovative organisations and projects that are delivering meaningful results for Kiwis. These awards celebrate outstanding performances and achievements in the public sector,” Dr Coleman said.

Last year, *Resolving Historic Claims of Child Abuse and Neglect* initiative won the Prime Minister's Supreme Award. The program, which was a joint initiative between the Ministry of Social Development, the Department of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Education, resolved more than 1000 cases of historic abuse within a decade, saving the taxpayer millions of dollars and achieving swift results for those affected.

“There are more success stories in the public sector that need to be told and replicated. These awards provide a unique opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve,” Dr Coleman said.

The Awards showcase the contribution the wider public sector makes to meeting the needs of New Zealanders. They recognise and promote excellence in terms of vision, innovation and results, and encourage continuous improvement.

Nominations are open until 1 March 2013 for organisations in the wider public sector, including: central government departments (public service departments and others), local government organisations (excluding council-controlled organisations), crown entities (including district health boards, crown research institutes and other crown entity companies, but excluding crown entity subsidiaries, and school boards of trustees), tertiary education institutions in the state sector (universities, polytechnics, wananga), Offices of Parliament, state-owned enterprises, and Public Finance Act Fourth Schedule Organisations.

More information about the awards is available at [www.ipanz.org.nz/excellenceawards](http://www.ipanz.org.nz/excellenceawards). The website contains guidelines, terms and conditions and details of how the nominations will be judged. It also provides all the documents needed to prepare and submit a nomination.
