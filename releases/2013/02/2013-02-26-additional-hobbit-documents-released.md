The Government has today released further Hobbit documents under the Official Information Act as recommended by the Ombudsman.

Further information contained in 18 documents form part of the correspondence relating to the filming of the Hobbit movies in New Zealand.

The Government originally sought to keep some of the information confidential in order to protect information that was provided in confidence and was commercially sensitive.

However, with the passage of time, the Government has agreed with the Ombudsman that the additional items now be released. The Ombudsman has recommended that some information continues to be withheld to maintain legal professional privilege.
