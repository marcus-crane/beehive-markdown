Visitor numbers for the Centenary Anzac Day Commemorative Services at Gallipoli on 25 April 2015 will be set at 10,500 people, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse has confirmed.

“The Turkish Government recently reviewed the Anzac Commemorative Site and has formally advised that the maximum capacity is 10,500 people,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“Demand for places at the 2015 Gallipoli commemorations is expected to significantly exceed the site capacity. That is why both Australia and New Zealand has agreed to ballot attendance passes.”

Of the 10,500 attendance passes, Australia will receive 8000, New Zealand 2000, with the remaining 500 reserved for those from Turkey and for VIPs representing New Zealand, Australia and other countries involved in the conflict.

“This allocation ratio is based on the relative number of casualties suffered by New Zealand and Australia during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915.”

Late last year both governments conducted extensive public consultation regarding balloting options for attendance at the 2015 commemorations.

“We will soon be in a position to make final decisions regarding balloting arrangements, and expect to announce further details in the coming weeks.

“New Zealand places great value on the enduring cooperation and support provided by Turkish authorities to the annual Anzac commemorations, and I thank them for that support,” says Mr Woodhouse.
