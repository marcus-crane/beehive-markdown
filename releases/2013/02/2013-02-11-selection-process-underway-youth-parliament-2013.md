The Minister of Youth Affairs, Hon Nikki Kaye, has opened the selection process for Youth Parliament 2013 and is inviting young people aged 16-18 to contact their local MP and apply to represent their community.

“As the Minister of Youth Affairs I am excited to be part of Youth Parliament 2013 and see young New Zealanders represent their communities on key issues. As well as receiving an inside look into the workings of Parliament, the people selected will participate in the government decision-making process. I want to acknowledge the work of Hon. Jo Goodhew for her involvement in the preparation of Youth Parliament 2013,” said Minister Kaye.

Held every parliamentary term, Youth Parliament will take place on 16 and 17 July and gives 121 young people the opportunity to debate legislation, sit on select committees and ask oral questions of cabinet ministers.

As well as representing their community at Youth Parliament in July, Youth MPs will hold their position from 1 May to 31 December 2013. During this time, it is expected they will actively engage with their community to gain an understanding of the ideas and concerns of youth in the area.

Young aspiring political journalists, aged 16-24, also have the opportunity to replicate the important role of the media in government. Ten Youth Press Gallery members are to be selected by the Parliamentary Press Gallery to report on the events of Youth Parliament 2013.

More information on becoming a Youth MP or Youth Press Gallery member, is available on the Youth Parliament website [www.youthparliament.govt.nz](http://www.youthparliament.govt.nz)
