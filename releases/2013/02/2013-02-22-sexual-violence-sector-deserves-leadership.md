Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has taken Ministerial leadership of the sexual violence sector which currently sits across several portfolios.

It’s an important step reflecting the importance of the work sexual violence service providers do and the difficulties they face.

“The sector has struggled and I think a big part of the problem is that they don’t have a single Minister to look to for leadership, so I’m prepared to take on that responsibility,” says Mrs Bennett

“I can’t perform miracles overnight and I know the sector understand that, but I am prepared to fight for what’s right.”

Currently organisations providing services to victims of sexual abuse have contracts with Justice, Health, Police, ACC, Social Development.

“It needs one Minister to pull all of this together for the sector.”

“We’re still operating under tight fiscal conditions, but I am keen to look at ways to help the sector meet the needs of sexual abuse victims.”
