Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Minister Dr Hon Pita Sharples have met with representatives of the Kōhanga Reo National Trust Board tonight to discuss the allegations made against them.

“While we were encouraged by the actions that the Trust has taken so far, which they have advised us of tonight, we have informed the Trust that the Ministry of Education will be commissioning an independent, specialist audit firm to review the controls the Trust has in place to assure itself that public funding is being used appropriately.

The audit will be done with the full cooperation of the Trust. We have agreed a draft Terms of Reference will be drawn up and that a final report will be sent to both parties independently for their assessment.

The audit will cover the financial management of all public funding.

We have agreed that this audit will be undertaken as a matter of urgency.
