Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has today announced a new programme for overseas farmers to spend time in New Zealand on an agri-tech study tour.

“Four places a year will be available for farmers to spend up to three weeks here, looking at improved agricultural productivity and reducing on-farm methane emissions,” says Mr Guy.

“This programme will be fully funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries and will help promote New Zealand’s agribusiness expertise overseas.

“My recent trip to South America has reinforced to me just how well respected New Zealand is overseas for the success of our agricultural sector.

“By collaborating and coordinating with others around the world we can improve our farming practices, enhance productivity and work to reduce our livestock emissions.”

Mr Guy made the announcement while speaking to a group of 170 Colombian farmers who are on a study tour to New Zealand.

“I’m delighted that Colombian farmers took up my invitation when I visited Bogota in March. The size of the delegation highlights the importance of working together and building closer links to this important part of the world.”

MPI will work with Federated Farmers and other farmer organisations to organise events like field trips and farm visits. The Board of the World Farmers Organisation has welcomed the initiative, which was presented to it by Federated Farmers President and WFO Board Member, Bruce Wills.

“This builds on the work of the Global Research Alliance (GRA) which New Zealand helped to establish in 2009. This is a science based initiative aimed at increasing international cooperation to help reduce emissions and enhance productivity.

“The GRA has now grown to include 40 countries, and this study tour will help support its goals by developing partnerships with farmers and farmer organisations,” says Mr Guy.
