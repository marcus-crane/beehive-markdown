Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson tonight announced a partnership involving a Christchurch building company and Italian architects and engineers has won the Breathe – New Urban Village design competition. 

The winner, a consortium consisting of Riccarton-based Holloway Builders in partnership with architects Anselmi Attiani Architettura and engineers Cresco, was named at an event at Christchurch’s Cardboard Cathedral.

“With a combination of stylish apartments and town houses with private backyards, this development represents smart inner city living as well as fulfilling the kiwi desire to have a place to put your barbecue.

“The judges, who include Grand Designs television host Kevin McCloud, say the winning entry is well-designed, structurally innovative and affordable,” Maurice Williamson says.

The medium density development consisting of 72 homes is set to be built across from Latimer Square, and is one of the 17 anchor projects in the Christchurch rebuild.  The Government will now work with the developers.

“The development will also provide high end retail and restaurant space, as well as outdoor public spaces that are perfect for the sort of festival events Christchurch excels at. 

“The winner is an excellent demonstration of how to build medium density housing and an example to be followed elsewhere,” Mr Williamson says.
