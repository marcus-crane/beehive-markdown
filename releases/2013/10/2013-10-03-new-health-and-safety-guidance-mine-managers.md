Specialist guidance for mine, quarry and tunnel managers to help them build a strong health and safety culture was released today by the Minister of Labour, Hon Simon Bridges.

“The guidance responds to one of the recommendations of the Pike River Royal Commission. In addition, the Independent Taskforce on Workplace Health and Safety noted that leadership is vital to creating a workplace culture in which health and safety comes first,” Mr Bridges says.

‘People Come First’ is a tool for managers in leading the charge to lift health and safety attitudes and performance in their businesses, and has been developed in consultation with industry experts.

“There must be a sustained commitment towards a safer mining industry and this guidance contains advice managers should be using every day,” Mr Bridges says.

“Commitment to health and safety from leaders will have a positive effect on the organisation, but it has to be words and action every day to create the strong culture that will protect their people and their businesses.”

Good Governance Practices Guideline for Managing Health and Safety Risks for company directors, developed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Institute of Directors, was also released recently.

“These two pieces of guidance together give company leaders the tools they need to ensure healthy and safe work is ‘what we do around here’,” Mr Bridges says.
