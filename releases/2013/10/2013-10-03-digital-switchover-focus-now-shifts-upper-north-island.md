Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss says Auckland and Upper North Island residents need to check they are ready for ‘going digital’.

After the Lower North Island’s successful switchover last weekend**,** the Upper North Island will be the final region to make the switch to digital television on 1 December 2013.

“More than 60,000 homes in the Upper North Island are still not ready and will be left without a television signal unless those people make the necessary changes.  Auckland and Upper North Island residents need to look at their options if they still want to watch television after the 1 December deadline,” Mr Foss says.

For those who are eligible there is a Targeted Assistance Package to help with the costs of the switchover.

Upper North Island digital update:

- 92 per cent of Upper North Island households with a TV have already made the switch to digital television.
- Nationally, more than 27,000 applications under the Targeted Assistance Package have been accepted.
- Messages will soon be broadcast on analogue transmissions for TV ONE, TV 2, TV 3 and Prime. These crawlers will advise viewers that the analogue service is ending.

“South Island and Lower North Island residents have already made the successful switch to digital television, but as New Zealand’s biggest city gears up to make the switch it is important to make sure you’re ready,” Mr Foss says.
