Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced two appointments to the Tertiary Education Commission board.

Business New Zealand Chief Executive Phil O’Reilly and businesswoman Vanessa Stoddart have been appointed as members of the Tertiary Education Commission.

“Mr O’Reilly and Ms Stoddart bring substantial leadership, governance and business experience to their roles on the Tertiary Education Commission board," Mr Joyce says. 

“Mr O’Reilly also brings strong links to the wider business community through his involvement in Business New Zealand.  These linkages will be invaluable as we continue our drive to ensure the relevance of tertiary education to industry skill needs.

“I would like to thank departing board member, Robin Hapi for his contribution to the Tertiary Education Commission board, which has benefited significantly from his experience and expertise.”
