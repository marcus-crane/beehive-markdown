New laws aimed at resolving trans-Tasman legal disputes more effectively were launched by Australian Attorney-General George Brandis and New Zealand’s Justice Minister Judith Collins in Sydney this evening.

“Trans-Tasman proceedings arrangements between New Zealand and Australia introduce a range of measures to make a trans-Tasman court case more like a case between people in the same country,” Ms Collins said.

“These arrangements reflect an unparalleled level of co-operation between two countries regarding cross-border legal disputes,” Senator Brandis said.

"Both governments have worked closely together to ensure the new regime delivers the maximum benefit for individuals and businesses on both sides of the Tasman.”

It will be easier for people in either country involved in a dispute to:

- start court proceedings against a person in the other country
- require people in the other country to give evidence
- register and enforce a civil court judgment in the other country

People involved in a case in the other country will be able to ask:

- for the case to be heard before a court in their country
- to appear before the court in the other country via video or audio link
- to suspend enforcement of a civil court judgment from the other country

The Agreement will also allow regulatory bodies to seek trans-Tasman enforcement of civil financial penalties and certain criminal fines for regulatory breaches.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER) between Australia and New Zealand.

“Australia and New Zealand have a strong, enduring friendship. Together, we have achieved deep economic and social integration,” Senator Brandis said.

“We have one of the most open economic and trade relationships in the world and last year total trade between countries was NZ$25.5 billion. As a result it’s become increasingly easy for people, goods and services to move between Australia and New Zealand,”  Ms Collins said,

”This ease of movement creates a greater risk of cross-border legal disputes that have historically been difficult to resolve. The new arrangement is designed to make resolving trans-Tasman disputes simpler and more efficient.”

The arrangements also support the CER and Single Economic Market (SEM) initiative, enabling businesses to operate across the Tasman in a seamless regulatory environment

“These laws will give businesses and individuals greater confidence when entering the trans-Tasman marketplace,” Senator Brandis said.
