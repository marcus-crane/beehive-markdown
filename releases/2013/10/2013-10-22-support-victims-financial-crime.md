The Minister responsible for the Serious Fraud Office, Anne Tolley, says victims of financial crime will be better supported, following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the SFO and Victim Support.

The MoU will see the two agencies working together to promote and deliver victim support services, and to keep victims informed about their cases.

SFO and Victim Support will also hold joint training sessions to help share information and best practice.

“Financial crime can have a devastating impact on its victims, often for the rest of their lives,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The emotional and financial consequences on these victims can be extremely traumatic, and they deserve support.

“That is why I asked the SFO to establish a close working relationship with Victim Support, to ensure that everything possible is being done to support victims of financial crime, and to keep them informed about their individual cases.

“Victims need to know that someone will be available to provide help and advice, and they also need to have confidence that those who commit financial crime are being held to account.

“The SFO has also published two guides to help victims understand the processes involved in investigations and prosecutions, and how this may affect them.”

The guides are available at [http://www.sfo.govt.nz/user\_guides](http://www.sfo.govt.nz/user_guides)

The new support service for victims of financial crime will be piloted in Auckland in early 2014, before being introduced across the country.
