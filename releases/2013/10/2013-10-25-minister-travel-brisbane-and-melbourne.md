Police Minister Anne Tolley is to travel to Brisbane and Melbourne from 28 - 31 October for meetings with Australian Police.

The Minister will visit the Queensland and Victoria Police training academies, and meet with State Police Ministers.

“I’ll have discussions on child protection and tackling gangs,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The main reason for the trip is to look at their different training methods for new Police recruits.

“Here in New Zealand we haven’t reviewed our training for a number of years, and I think it is time to ensure it is fit for purpose, and that it meets the needs of our new officers.

“It makes sense to see how other jurisdictions are adapting and changing their training, and to see if we can adopt any improvements which will allow Police to provide an even better service to the public.”
