Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has today congratulated the winners of the Women of Influence Awards, held for the first time last night.

“These awards are about identifying bold, energetic women who are helping to shape the spirit and future of New Zealand,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The awards recognise 50 influential women across five categories – management and business, local and regional, entrepreneur, community service and social enterprise, and innovation and science.

“I was honoured to present the Supreme Award to Therese Walsh.”

Mrs Walsh, winner of the Board and Management category, is head of the New Zealand operations for the next Cricket World Cup.

Prior to this appointment, Mrs Walsh was the chief operating officer for the highly successful 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign.

“Mrs Walsh has given much to her industry, as well as the country as a whole. She is best described as the ''Wonder Woman'' of mega-sport events.

“I also commend Mrs Walsh for helping raise the profile of women in key leadership and senior management positions.

“Mrs Walsh has clearly excelled in her field, and is a deserving winner of the Woman of Influence 2013 award.” says Mrs Goodhew.
