The Government is investing $530,000 through the Major Events Development Fund to support the 2014 and 2015 Art Deco Weekends in Hawke’s Bay, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The Hawke’s Bay annual event is held on the third weekend in February to mark the anniversary of the 1931 Napier Earthquake, and attracts up to 30,000 attendees.  Associated events before and after the main event extend the festival duration to eight days.

“Art Deco Weekend is unique to the region and New Zealand and provides an opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves in 1930s culture, music, history and heritage,” Mr Joyce says. 

The organisers of the 2014 event will use the investment to take a step up and develop international marketing initiatives that will raise its international scale and profile. The 2015 investment will be used to build on the 2014 initiatives, ensuring the event continues to grow its profile on the international stage and increase its international visitor numbers.

“Government invests in events that have the ability to showcase New Zealand internationally as a desirable visitor and major events destination,” Mr Joyce says

“The two-year investment from the Government of more than half a million dollars in Hawke’s Bay will be matched by funding from local and regional councils in that region.”

The event has previously attracted up to 3,000 international visitors. This number is expected to grow by more than 50 per cent in 2014 as a result of the new marketing initiatives that will target key trade markets such as Australia, North America, China and the United Kingdom.
