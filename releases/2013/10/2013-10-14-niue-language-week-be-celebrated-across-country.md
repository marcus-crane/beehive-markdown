Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata says Niue Language Week is a great opportunity for all New Zealanders to celebrate the unique culture and language of one of our most vibrant Pacific communities.

“Niue Language Week runs from October 13-19 with the theme, Leveki mo e fakaaoga e Vagahau Niue – Treasure and use the Niue Language, providing a strong focus for events around the country,” says Ms Parata.

“Although the home island population may be small, Niueans in New Zealand are our fourth-largest Pacific group, contributing to our diverse Pacific population.

In 2006, 25 percent of the Niuean population in New Zealand were able to hold an everyday conversation in vagahau Niue.

“Pacific communities are committed to ensuring the revitalisation and retention of their heritage language and language weeks are a crucial tool in assisting with that goal.

“Pacific language weeks also highlight the important fact that speaking a second language enhances educational success. Put simply, speaking two languages builds bigger brains.

Niuean Language Week is organised largely by the Vagahau Niue Trust and Matakau Pulefakamotu Niue Okalana, with support from the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs.

“I encourage you to an experience a Niue language week event where you will discover Niue music, language, culture and contribute to the preserving of Niue language and culture in New Zealand,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Parata says supporting Pacific languages and cultures was one of her priorities as Pacific Island Affairs Minister and it is deeply relevant to her Education portfolio.

Niue Language Week is the sixth Pacific Language Week to be held this year.
