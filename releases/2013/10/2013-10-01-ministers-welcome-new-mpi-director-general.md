Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye are welcoming Martyn Dunne CNZM as the new Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).

“Mr Dunne has an outstanding record of service in the military, the public service and as a diplomat,” says Mr Guy.

“His appointment signals a fresh start for MPI. I look forward to working with him on important issues like biosecurity and doubling our exports by 2025.”

Mr Dunne is currently New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Australia, and is a previous Chief Executive of the New Zealand Customs Service. He also has a distinguished record of 27 years’ service in the military, where he attained the rank of Major General and was the commander of New Zealand forces in East Timor.

"Martyn Dunne's experience in trade access will be valuable as MPI strengthens its capability in areas such as food safety and market assurance to take advantage of opportunities in new and emerging markets," says Ms Kaye.

“His previous experience with customs in dealing with border security will be very important, as will his experience on trade issues and leadership skills,” says Mr Guy.

“This is a very important role, given that the primary industries remain the backbone of New Zealand’s economy. They make up over 70% of our exports and generate around $32 billion in earnings a year.”

Mr Dunne has been appointed for a term of three years beginning on 18 November 2013.

“We want to thank Acting Director-General Scott Gallacher who has done an outstanding job over the last few months,” the Ministers’ say.
