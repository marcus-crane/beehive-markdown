Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $60,000 funding to deliver mentoring opportunities for up to 50 for young people with disabilities.

“I am allocating a total of $60,000 over the next three years to the YES Disability Resource Centre,” Ms Kaye says.

“This is to assist the Carabiner youth mentoring programme which matches young people with disabilities, aged 17 to 24, with a volunteer mentor.

“From my travels around the country as Youth Affairs Minister, I have seen the positive influence that supportive mentoring relationships have on the lives of young people.

“I know that some of the aspirations of the young people currently on the Carabiner programme include becoming an oncologist/cancer researcher, a Spanish language translator, and an engineer.

“This is an organisation focused on improving opportunities for young people and it is important that we have programmes which inspire, support and assist our young people.

“In talking to young people with disabilities, I have been moved by some of the challenges that they have told me about in terms of bullying, but also in terms of having access to people with leadership positions in the community that understand their journey.”

Carabiner is a goal orientated mentoring programme, linking potential with success.  Its programmes give young people with disabilities the support, guidance and confidence they need to achieve their goals and to create a sense of belonging and increased independence.

The Carabiner youth mentoring programme was founded and has grown through the inspiration of Cam Calkoen, a YES Disability Resource Centre Ambassador. Since it began in 2009 the Carabiner programme has graduated over 50 mentorships.
