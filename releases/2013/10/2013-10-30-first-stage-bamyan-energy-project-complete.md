Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the completion of the first stage of the Renewable Energy Project in Bamyan, Afghanistan.

An opening ceremony attended by Afghan Economic Minister Mohammad Hadi Arghandewal and other Afghan dignitaries was held on 26 October.

“With funding from New Zealand the first stage of a 1 megawatt solar array has now been completed. Once fully operational it will be the largest solar array in Afghanistan and will provide access to a reliable source of power for 2500 homes, businesses and government buildings,” Mr McCully says.

“This will improve the lives of thousands and create new opportunities for economic development in Bamyan province.

“Importantly, the project has also built up the local energy utility so that it can manage and maintain the array and electricity network. This is critical to the on-going sustainability of the initiative. New Zealand will continue to provide support to the utility company for a year after the project is completed.

“When we withdrew our Provincial Reconstruction Team in April this year, we made it clear that this would not signal the end of our support for Afghanistan.”

New Zealand has provided $18.6 million toward the project, which is being delivered by two New Zealand companies - NetCon Ltd and Sustainable Energy Services International.

The project is expected to be completed before the end of the year.
