Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has officially opened a new mountain bike track in Taupo, which was built with the help of offenders serving community sentences.

Over the past three years, 150 offenders have contributed 1,120 working hours to complete the new 2.5 kilometre Beagle Boys Mountain Bike Track.

Bike Taupo has been a sponsor for offenders sentenced to Community Work since 2010, supporting them gain skills and work experience in water management, scrub clearing and planting, small construction and building, and weed control. Offenders have also contributed track design ideas.

“I want to thank Bike Taupo for being such an important partner to Corrections,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They’ve provided opportunities for offenders to gain skills and experience, while also making a great contribution to the local community.

“We don’t want offenders to commit more crimes. Skills training and work experience are important in securing employment, and we know that if offenders have a job they are less likely to create more victims by offending again.

“Our Community Work staff have also put a lot of effort into making this new track a reality, and I want to say well done and thank you to them as well.

“It was a real pleasure to open the new bike track, and I hope that local, national and international riders will enjoy it.”
