235,000 homes have been insulated under the Government’s *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* programme, well above the original target set.

“When the Government launched the programme in 2009 to help make Kiwi homes warmer, drier and healthier, we had a target of 188,500 insulated by 2013,” says Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges.

“The programme has seen 235,000 homes insulated, directly improving the living conditions of many thousands of New Zealanders.  This is a resounding success.”

Mr Bridges says a strong insulation industry has been built as a result of the programme, and the benefits of better home insulation are now well known.

“*Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* is now drawing to its planned completion following the launch recently of the targeted *Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes* programme announced in this year’s Budget.

“This new programme offers free ceiling and underfloor insulation for low-income households, particularly families with children and high health needs.  It’s expected to insulate around 46,000 additional houses over the next three years,” says Mr Bridges.

“Many organisations, including third party funders, insulation service providers and local authorities, have worked together to help make these programmes a success and I thank them all for their contribution.”

*Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes* is being rolled out across the country by the Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority, with projects already announced in regions from Northland to Southland.
