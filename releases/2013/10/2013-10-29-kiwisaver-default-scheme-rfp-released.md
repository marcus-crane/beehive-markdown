A Request for Proposal (RFP) for the provision of KiwiSaver default schemes has been released, Commerce Minister Craig Foss announced today.

The default provider schemes began in 2007 and provide a conservative investment product to build confidence in KiwiSaver while members decide which fund best suits their individual needs. The current default providers’ appointments expire at the end of June 2014. The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment has today released a RFP for default providers for the next seven years.

“Default providers currently manage about $3.4 billion on behalf of about 465,000 New Zealand savers who are in the default fund they were allocated,” says Mr Foss.

“The RFP criteria are similar to the original RFP in 2006 with one new requirement that focuses on helping savers make informed investment decisions.

“As part of this RFP, providers must offer investor education to members of default schemes to encourage them to actively choose a KiwiSaver investment product according to their individual circumstances and needs.

“This may mean actively choosing a conservative KiwiSaver product, which is what the default product is, or choosing another option such as a balanced, growth or life stages investment product,” says Mr Foss.

The additional member education criterion builds on the Government’s work to improve New Zealanders’ financial literacy and create informed savers and investors.

“All KiwiSaver providers are now required to publish quarterly disclosure statements online and in an standardised format. Making KiwiSaver reporting more accessible is part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda, which includes a comprehensive range of actions to build high-performing capital markets to support business growth,” says Mr Foss.

The RFP closes on 13 December 2013. For more information visit [www.gets.govt.nz](http://www.gets.govt.nz)
