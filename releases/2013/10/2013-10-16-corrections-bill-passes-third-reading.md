Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says a Bill which improves the effectiveness of community sentences and orders has passed its third reading in Parliament.

The Administration of Community Sentences and Orders Bill amends the Bail Act 2000, Parole Act 2002 and Sentencing Act 2002, and clarifies aspects of home detention, community-based sentences and electronic monitoring.

“We are tightening legislation and closing some existing loopholes to improve public safety,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Those offenders on community-based sentences and home detention will now have to complete their full sentences, which some have managed to avoid up until now.

“A home detention sentence will continue to run unless bail is granted, replacing the current system where the sentence is suspended if an offender lodges an appeal.

“Offenders who abscond from community-based sentences will also now be held to account, as Corrections will be able to apply for a suspension of the sentence until the offender is located.

“In addition, the Bill will allow Probation Officers, without reference to the Court, to direct that up to 20 per cent of a community work sentence be spent in training on basic work and living skills, if the Officer believes it will reduce the offender’s risk of re-offending.

“These amendments, along with other administrative changes, are ensuring that the legislation is effective and efficient, and is delivering the service and safer communities that New Zealanders expect and deserve.

“I acknowledge the cross-party support for this Bill.”
