A bill to better support current and future veterans has passed its first reading unanimously in Parliament this evening.

“The Veterans’ Support Bill enables the Government to better meet the needs of both older veterans who require assistance to remain in their own homes and veterans of modern-day deployments,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The Government recognises the significant sacrifice and contribution our veterans have made for our country. Replacing the outdated War Pensions Act 1954 with this modern bill demonstrates our commitment to those who have given service.”

The Veteran’ Support Bill follows a Law Commission report that provided the most comprehensive review of veterans’ entitlements in 60 years.

“The Government has adopted 132 of the 170 recommendations reported by the Law Commission as part of a $60 million package of changes of which this Bill forms the material part.

“I have received positive feedback from a number of veterans on the changes, and have confidence the Veterans’ Support bill will better meet their needs and provide the support they require going forward.”

The Bill contains many of the same provisions as the current Act. The service eligibility criteria remain the same and all veterans currently covered under the 1954 Act will have coverage under the new legislation.
