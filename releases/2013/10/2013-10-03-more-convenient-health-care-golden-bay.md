Health Minister Tony Ryall today visited the recently opened Golden Bay Integrated Family Health Centre, in Takaka.

“Under one roof, patients can see their GP, consult their midwife, be attended to by a nurse, arrange an operation when the surgical bus visits and talk with public health staff. And I understand ambulance services may be next to join,” says Mr Ryall.

“Bringing health services closer to people’s homes is a priority for this Government. Having a range of high quality health providers co-located together is convenient for patients.

“A real strength of this centre is the inclusion of continuing care and the transfer of aged residential care, previously provided by the Joan Whiting Trust Rest Home. This will keep rest home beds in Golden Bay and provide seamless health care for patients as they age and their needs change.

“A centre such as this is also good for the health professionals. They'll be working side by side – caring for the same patients and working together when a second opinion is required.

“I was mightily impressed by the way the community has made this happen with the great support of the Golden Bay Community Health Trust, Nelson Bays Primary Health, Nelson Marlborough District Health Board and the Ministry of Health,” says Mr Ryall.
