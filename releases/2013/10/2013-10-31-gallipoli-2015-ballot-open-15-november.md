The ballot for Anzac Day 2015 passes at Gallipoli will open on 15 November 2013 and close on 31 January 2014, says Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“The Gallipoli campaign is an important part of New Zealand’s history, and demand for the Anzac centenary commemorations in Turkey is expected to exceed the safe capacity for the site,” Mr Woodhouse says.

New Zealand has been granted 2000 attendance passes, and Australia 8000, that will be allocated by a ballot running simultaneously on both sides of the Tasman.

Mr Woodhouse says the ballot was due to open on 1 November, but has been delayed by two weeks at the request of the Australian Government to provide more time for the new administration.

“While attendance passes will be free of charge, those who are successful will need to make all their own travel arrangements and meet their own costs.”
