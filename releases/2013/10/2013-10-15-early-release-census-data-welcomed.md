Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson today welcomed the early release of regional population information from the 2013 Census.

Statistics New Zealand has released detailed population information about regional council, territorial authority, area unit and Auckland local board counts.

“The release of this information comes two months ahead of schedule and provides insights into the population, which will help to inform decision making.

“Census information also helps create a picture of our communities and provides an important snapshot of us as a country, including where we live, who we are, what we do for work and so on,” Maurice Williamson says.

Since census night in March, 5.6 million individual and dwelling forms have been collected and it has taken 195,130 hours to process them.

Data from the 2013 Census will continue to be released over the next 18 months. On December 3rd, more detailed information on age, sex, location and ethnicity breakdowns at a national level will be published.
