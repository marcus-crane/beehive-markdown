An agreement between CYF and Tainui marks a new understanding and connection between the two says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

The Memorandum of Understanding was signed in Waikato today.

“This is the third agreement to be signed with iwi and is a significant step forward,” says Mrs Bennett.

“A new working relationship will focus on protecting children, using iwi networks to proactively support whānau in need.”

“Too many Māori children are hurt and abused; by openly acknowledging this and working together with iwi we can support these children and their families earlier, and then this MoU will really mean something.”

Child Youth and Family had a staff member seconded to Waikato Tainui for the last twelve months to help pave the way for the new relationship.

Tainui and Child, Youth and Family will work together to put the interests of vulnerable children first.

There are close to 5,000 children in the care of CYF, 441 of those children are affiliated to Waikato Tainui.

Child, Youth and Family has now signed Memorandums of Understanding with Tainui, Ngapuhi and Ngati Porou.
