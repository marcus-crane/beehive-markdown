Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman today met with senior Chinese military chief General Zhao Keshi, member of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Logistics Department.

“It is great to welcome General Zhao to New Zealand. He is the most senior Chinese official to visit this year across government, and the most senior People’s Liberation Army visitor since 2010,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand engages with a wide range of defence partners in the Asia-Pacific region.

“General Zhao’s visit complements the excellent relationship New Zealand has with China across a range of areas.

“New Zealand’s defence engagement with the PLA has been nurtured in recent years, along with our broader bilateral relationship. The NZDF is keen to continue to build its engagement with the PLA.”

A PLA Navy Task Force recently visited Auckland, reciprocating HMNZS Te Mana’s port visits to Shanghai and Hong Kong earlier this year. In August, the NZDF hosted Australian, US and Chinese military personnel for the first time for Exercise Phoenix Spirit, a humanitarian and disaster relief activity.
