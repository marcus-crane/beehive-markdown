Revenue Minister Todd McClay today announced that from 1 April next year, low-income working families who are eligible for the minimum family tax credit will receive an increase.

“The minimum family tax credit currently ensures that families who work the minimum number of hours and who are not receiving a benefit will have an after-tax income of $22,724 a year. This will rise to $22,776 a year from 1 April 2014,” says Mr McClay.

The minimum family tax credit provides a guaranteed minimum family income to families who are in work and ensures they are no worse off moving off a benefit and into paid employment.

The increase, which reflects small inflation rises, was approved by Order in Council on 21 October 2013.
