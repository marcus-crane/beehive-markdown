Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today released the Draft Tertiary Education Strategy (2014-2019) that seeks to improve the way tertiary education supports achievement, industry, innovation, and economic growth.

The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment are consulting with the education and business sectors on the draft strategy, which will set the direction of tertiary education for the next five years.

The draft strategy contains six strategic priorities: delivering skills for industry; 

getting at-risk young people into a career; boosting achievement of Māori and Pasifika; improving adult literacy and numeracy; growing international linkages; and strengthening research-based institutions.

“Tertiary education is a passport to success. Developing strong links with employers will help ensure students have the skills they need to succeed. This in turn will increase employment, boost incomes and help grow the New Zealand economy,” Mr Joyce says.

“We are seeing increased competition from around the world both for skilled graduates and leading academics, in particular from developing nations. For New Zealand to remain internationally competitive, our tertiary institutions need to ensure their relevance in the modern workplace, expand their research links and connections with industry, attract more international students, and invest more in disciplines where they have a competitive advantage.”

The Draft Tertiary Education Strategy 2014-2019 consultation closes on 15 November and is available at [www.minedu.govt.nz/tesconsultation](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/tesconsultation)
