In the past three months, 5000 New Zealanders with long term health conditions, such as diabetes or arthritis, have signed up for regular advice and medication checks with their local pharmacy.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says this brings the total number of people registered for the new Long Term Conditions (LTC) service to over 133,000.

“Pharmacists are experts in the area of medication management. This new service provides extra support for patients and encourages and rewards pharmacists for using their expertise.

“Research shows, the more medicines a person takes, the more likely it is they will get doses or timing muddled. This service is targeted at helping patients with multiple complex health conditions that have difficulty managing their numerous medicines.

“As I travel around the country, pharmacists tell me they are talking more with their local GPs and are more involved in patient care.

“They suggest alternate medication to prevent side effects, synchronise repeat prescriptions to prevent unnecessary trips to the pharmacy and provide patient education on how to take their medicines correctly,” says Mr Ryall.

The LTC service was introduced in July last year as part of the new Community Pharmacy Services Agreement.

The new service aims to reward pharmacists for use of their clinical expertise, instead of solely paying for each prescription filled.
