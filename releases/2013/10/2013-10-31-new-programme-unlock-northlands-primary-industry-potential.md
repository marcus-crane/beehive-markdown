Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has launched a new programme to help unlock the potential for primary industry growth in Northland today.

“This is the start of a wider programme by the Ministry for Primary Industries to work in partnership with regions to help them further develop industries like agriculture, horticulture, forestry, and aquaculture.

“We chose to start with Northland because it has significant potential, with a good climate and a vast tracts of land suitable for further development,” says Mr Guy.

MPI is already working with two Māori-owned farms in Northland. One involves the conversion of 270 hectares of Māori land to a dairy farm. The other involves providing technical support for a 2480 hectare dairy and beef farm to increase productivity, with the support of key partners including Landcorp, Dairy NZ and Te Tumu Paeroa.

“Other opportunities in Northland include the development of a new finfish industry, and increasing on-farm productivity,” says Mr Guy.

“By growing the primary sector the aim is to create local jobs, lift incomes, and increase the value of exports.

“A good example of this is the Northland Hub which is a collaboration between educational institutions and Māori agribusinesses. They are working together to train and attract school leavers into the primary industries."

The next step in this programme will involve formalising the Government’s partnership with the Northland Economic Advisory Group and holding a primary sector hui with partners including Iwi, Northland businesses, Training and research institutes, Northland District Councils, the Regional Council, Industry Organisations and other government agencies.

"I look forward to following the progress of these important projects and building on the momentum that today's launch has created.

“Unlocking the potential of New Zealand’s regions is an important part of building a more productive and competitive national economy. It will be very important in achieving our goal of doubling primary sector exports by 2025,” says Mr Guy.
