Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the reports on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Periods 13, 14 and 15 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 13, which was paid on the morning of 18 September, paid 90,390 people a total of $177.35 million.

The report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.15 per cent of staff across the country, 11 staff were notified as not paid, 66 were overpaid, and 58 underpaid. Affected staff were from 108 schools or 4.44 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 14, which was paid on the morning of 2 October, paid 90,687 people a total of $176.10 million.

Complaints and notifications, in regards to that pay period, were received regarding 0.18 per cent of staff across the country, 11 staff were notified as not paid, 21 were overpaid, and 128 underpaid. Affected staff were from 133 schools or 5.42 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 15, which was paid on the morning of 16 October, paid 84,263 people a total of $157.26 million.

Complaints and notifications, in regards to that pay period, were received regarding 0.21 per cent of staff across the country, nine staff were notified as not paid, 90 were overpaid, and 77 underpaid. Affected staff were from 118 schools or 4.81 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“Pay Period 15 was the 15th of the last 16 pay rounds below the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review team,” Mr Joyce says.

“However, there were two significant one-off issues created by bugs in the Novopay system in Pay Period 14.

“The first affected the pay of 102 staff who were either underpaid or overpaid their termination pay at the end of term three. It was caused primarily by a new error that arose in one of the many software updates that have been made as the Ministry and its suppliers have been remediating the system.  The affected staff have been contacted, underpayments have been corrected, and arrangements are being made to recover the overpayments.

“The second issue was an incorrect start date for term four that appeared on 76,000 payslips. This error has been previously noted in the media and has not impacted on anyone’s pay.

“The errors are of course unacceptable and the Ministry of Education has apologised to those whose pay has been affected or those who have been concerned about the accuracy of dates on their payslip. Work is underway by the Ministry and Talent2 to fix the defects to ensure they don’t happen again.

“These issues are a reminder that while good progress has been made in stabilising the fortnightly pay run, many challenges are still being worked on to achieve a system that delivers to expectations.”
