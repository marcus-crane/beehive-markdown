The Associate Minister of Social Development, Tariana Turia, launched the Nga Vaka o Kaiga Tapu: Pasefika Proud Family Violence Research Plan at an event in Auckland this week.     

 “The Pasefika Proud Family Violence Research Plan is unique, as it is the first research agenda of its kind to carry cultural significance across the Pacific for the Pasefika peoples of Niue, Cook Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Samoa, Tokelau and Tonga living in Aotearoa New Zealand today,” said Minister Turia. 

The research plan was commissioned by the Ministry of Social Development and the work was led by the Pacific Advisory Group (PAG) to the Taskforce Against Violence Within Families, which advises government on the issues relating to addressing family violence in Pacific communities. 

The evening also hosted the inaugural Pasefika Proud Community Awards to celebrate and recognise Pacific peoples taking leadership, action and innovation in the Pacific family violence field.

“These Awards recognise the commitment and dedication by Pacific individuals and groups who believe in eliminating violence from our homes and our communities. The Awards are also part of PAG's basket of tools in its work to make our homes violence free,” says PAG Chairman, Fa'amatuainu Tino Pereira.

The event marked the beginning of regional fono being held around the country, starting with the Pasefika Proud Auckland Fono at the Waipuna Hotel. The purpose of the fono is for the PAG to feed back to Pacific communities on what activities have occurred and what activities are being done to address violence in Pacific families and communities. The Fono will also provide an opportunity for the Pacific community to feed back on family violence issues they feel are important to them.
