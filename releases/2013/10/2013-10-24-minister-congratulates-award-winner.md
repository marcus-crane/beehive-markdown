Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated Emeline Afeaki-Mafile’o who won the Community Service/Social Enterprise section at the inaugural Women of Influence Awards.

The awards, which were held in Auckland last night, recognise and reward women who are having an impact well beyond their formal roles, using their passion and influence to improve the world for others.

Emeline Afeaki-Mafile’o has been recognised for her work in mentoring young Pasifika students through her not for profit company – Affirming Works. 

“It is fantastic to see Mrs Afeaki-Mafile’o, a successful and driven Pacific Island woman, being recognised for her hard work in raising achievement for young Pasifika people and bettering the community. She is an active part of that village it takes to raise a young person, and I want to add my thanks,” Ms Parata says.

“The Pasifika community in New Zealand is vibrant and youthful. By supporting these students to realise their personal potential and encouraging them to become actively involved in their local communities, Mrs Afeaki-Mafile’o is helping develop young people who will be able to make the fullest contribution to New Zealand that they can.”

To date Affirming Works has provided mentoring for over 5000 youth and children as well as providing training and employment opportunities for over 100 youth workers.
