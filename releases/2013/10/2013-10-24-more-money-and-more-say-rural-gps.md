Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced an extra $9 million to support rural general practices over the next four years.

"This new investment is on top of the $13 million a year already earmarked for rural general practice support. The objective is to help general practices better retain clinical staff and services,” says Mrs Goodhew. 

“This additional funding will take effect from 1 July 2014 when a new way of allocating rural funding will be rolled out.

“These changes follow a thorough review of the current Rural Ranking Score by the Ministry of Health, District Health Boards (DHBs) and the New Zealand Rural General Practice Network.

“This review resulted in the *Case for Change* paper which was released in December 2012 and identified a number of issues with the current funding approach. In particular there was a consensus that the long standing rules were too bureaucratic. 

“The new approach will involve local alliances of DHBs, Primary Health Organisations and practices working together to agree on the services and the appropriate funding arrangements.

“This government is committed to supporting primary care services in rural communities. This new approach will mean there is greater decision making at the grass roots level, and more flexibility as community needs change.

“DHBs already spend over $13 million a year supporting rural general practice - this extra top up will help continue the work they are doing.

“There are more than 200 rural general practices in New Zealand, providing an important health role in their communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Rural funding is in addition to general practice capitation funding.
