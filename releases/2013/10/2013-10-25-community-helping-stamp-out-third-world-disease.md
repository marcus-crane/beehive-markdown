Health Minister Tony Ryall gathered with local schools and health professionals this morning at Ruapotaka Marae in Glen Innes for the official launch of the Auckland sore throat drop-in clinics.

“As part of the government’s $45 million campaign to stamp out rheumatic fever, eight sore throat drop-in clinics have recently opened across the Auckland region,” says Mr Ryall.

“At least 60 more nurse-led drop-in clinics will open in greater Auckland and Porirua over the next few months.

“It’s difficult to tell the difference between a strep sore throat that needs treatment and a sore throat that will get better on its own. We’re taking out the guesswork by making it quick, easy and free for at-risk children to get all sore throats checked.

“By the end of the year, over 28,000 children in around 70 schools in the greater Auckland region will be able to get their sore throat checked at school.

“These community sore throat drop-in clinics will mean children who don’t attend schools with throat swabbing services or children who get a sore throat outside of school term can receive a free sore throat check.

“Rheumatic Fever is a preventable illness that develops from a strep sore throat. If we treat this sore throat quickly with antibiotics, we can stop our children and young people from developing rheumatic fever,” says Mr Ryall.

In Budget 2013 the National-led Government invested an additional $21.3 million to fight rheumatic fever, including $11.25 million over four years for sore throat drop-in clinics.
