Midland general practitioners (GPs) and hospital doctors have a new diagnostic tool at their fingertips, the Map of Medicine.

“The Map of Medicine has pathways for hundreds of health conditions. The web-based software works like an online flowchart, guiding health professionals as to what the best treatment options are for patients,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Mr Ryall, joined by local MPs Tim Macindoe and David Bennett, visited Waikato Hospital today and spoke to staff about the Map of Medicine which has recently been rolled out in the Midland region.

“It’s great to hear that many Midland GPs and representatives from every health profession have been involved – this is a great example of clinical integration.

“Midland health professionals are all sitting around one table working together to develop the pathways and get the best possible results for their community.

“The pathways are based on international best practice and adapted for local communities to ensure patients receive the best care,” says Mr Ryall.

Bay of Plenty, Lakes, Tairawhiti, Taranaki and Waikato District Health Boards (DHBs) are part of the Midland region grouping of DHBs that are using Map of Medicine. MidCentral DHB also introduced the tool in 2012 where it is working very successfully.
