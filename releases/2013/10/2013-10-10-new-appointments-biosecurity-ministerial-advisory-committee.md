Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced five new appointments to the Biosecurity Ministerial Advisory Committee today.

The Committee plays an important role in providing the Minister with independent advice on the performance of New Zealand’s biosecurity system as a whole, and on specific biosecurity issues where necessary.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority, and hugely important to New Zealand as a trading nation,” says Mr Guy.

“A world class biosecurity system protects New Zealand from unwanted pests and diseases. This is essential for working towards our goal of doubling the value of our primary sector exports to $64 billion by 2025.

“The new appointees bring a range of skills, experience and networks, and create a wealth of expertise on the Committee.”

The new members are:

- Rob Phillips (Chief Executive, Environment Southland)
- Peter Ombler (Chairman of Kiwifruit Vine Health)
- Professor Philip Hulme (Professor of Plant Biosecurity, Lincoln University)
- Catherine Taylor (Consultant with specialty experience in the aviation and maritime sectors)
- Dr Jacqueline Beggs (Associate Professor of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland).

The role of the committee is to provide the Minister with advice on future trends, risks and issues that may impact on the performance of the biosecurity system, and to identify opportunities for improvement.

The five appointees join four reappointments to the Committee: Graeme Marshall, Terry Donaldson, David Douglas and Dr Caroline Saunders*.*

Graeme Marshall has been appointed as the Chair for a three year term.
