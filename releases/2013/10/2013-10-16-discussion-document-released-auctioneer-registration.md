Consumer Affairs Minister Craig Foss has released a discussion paper on proposed details of the new auctioneer registration regime as part of the Consumer Law Reform Bill.

“The Bill will introduce the most significant reforms to New Zealand’s consumer laws in more than 20 years. As part of these reforms, the Bill provides for an easier and more cost-effective auctioneer registration regime to strengthen consumer confidence,” says Mr Foss.

The discussion document looks at the level of fees and information to be required from auctioneers as part of registration.

“We are consolidating and improving our trading laws to better protect consumers and to create a more innovative and competitive business environment and this new regime is part of that work,” says Mr Foss.
