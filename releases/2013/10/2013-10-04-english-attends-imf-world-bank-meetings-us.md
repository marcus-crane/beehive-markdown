Finance Minister Bill English leaves on Monday for the United States, where he will attend the annual meetings of International Monetary Fund and World Bank governors in Washington DC.

He will also meet senior representatives of credit ratings agencies and the New York Stock Exchange in New York and speak with investment and business leaders in Boston.

“The meetings will provide another opportunity to assess latest global economic developments and their likely impact on New Zealand,” Mr English says.

“Compared to many developed economies, New Zealand is well placed with a growing economy and government books that will be back in surplus next year. But there is no room for complacency and we need to continue improving our competitiveness and financial stability.

“Ongoing global challenges will have an impact on New Zealand, and I expect that to continue for some time. So I’m keen to hear first-hand from the policy makers and business people dealing directly with these deep-seated issues.”

In New York, Mr English will speak at an investor function, meet senior executives of ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, and visit the New York Stock Exchange. In Boston, he will speak at the Harvard Kennedy Business School and hold a series of meetings with business and investment leaders, as well as the Boston Federal Reserve.

Mr English will conclude his visit by attending the IMF and World Bank governors’ annual meetings in Washington, where he will meet a number of other finance ministers, including Australia’s new Treasurer Joe Hockey. He will also visit the Federal Reserve.

Mr English leaves New Zealand on 7 October and returns on 15 October.
