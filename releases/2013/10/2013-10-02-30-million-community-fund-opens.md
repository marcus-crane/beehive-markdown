Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board Chris Tremain today announced the opening of the $30 million dollar Lottery Grants Board Significant Projects Fund.

“This is a great opportunity for New Zealand communities and I am really excited about the benefits this funding will bring about. Thirty million dollars is a large amount of money and it will enable large and important community projects to be completed, creating a legacy for future generations,” says Mr Tremain.

“From today, New Zealanders with community projects worth $3 million or more will be able to receive early feedback on whether their project would meet the funding criteria for the Lottery Significant Projects Fund.  Applicants who fill out an ‘expression of interest form’ will also receive support to complete a full application.”

The Significant Projects Fund has previously supported a number of iconic projects across New Zealand:

- Auckland Zoo Charitable Trust received a grant of $2,694,000 to develop Te Wao Nui; a unique set of habitats allowing visitors to explore the animals, plants and culture of New Zealand
- The Carter Observatory Trust in Wellington received a grant of $698,412 towards a major refurbishment project to provide an improved educational facility.
- The Methven Heritage Association received $1,901,594 in 2010 towards the redevelopment of Mount Hutt Memorial Hall to create an interactive exhibition of snow-sports history and culture, and an agricultural education centre named ‘New Zealand’s Alpine and Agriculture Encounter’
- Ngai Tahu Māori Rock Art Charitable Trust near Timaru received $594,852 towards the Māori Rock Art Centre.
- A grant of $6 million was awarded to enable the construction of the Q Theatre in Auckland.

Expressions of interest are now being accepted for the Significant Projects Fund. This form is available on [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).

Applications close on 4 December 2013.  It is anticipated that funding decisions will be made in February 2014.
