Associate Minister of Health Tariana Turia announced the opening of eight sore throat drop-in clinics in Auckland this week as part of the Government’s $45 million campaign to reduce rates of rheumatic fever.

“These drop-in clinics offer easy, free sore throats checks for children who don’t attend schools with throat swabbing services or when it’s out of school term,” says Mrs Turia.

“Rheumatic Fever is a preventable illness that develops from a strep sore throat. If we treat this sore throat quickly with antibiotics, we can stop our children and young people from developing rheumatic fever.”

In Budget 2013 the Maori Party negotiated as part of the relationship accord with the National-led Government to invest an additional $21.3 million to fight rheumatic fever, including $11.25 million over four years for sore throat drop-in clinics.

The eight drop-in clinics are based in general practices and other community settings in Manurewa, Otara, Mangere, Mt Wellington and Glen Innes. At least 60 more drop-in clinics will open in greater Auckland and Porirua over the next few months.
