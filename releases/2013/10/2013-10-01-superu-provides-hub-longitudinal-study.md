The Families Commission’s new Social Policy and Evaluation Research Unit (SuPERU) will manage the Growing Up in New Zealand study from today.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomed the transfer of the longitudinal study from the Ministry of Social Development to SuPERU.

“This is a pleasing development and means the study will now benefit from the academic rigour of the SuPERU and its focus on delivering greater transparency and value for money.”

The study led by the University of Auckland, follows a group of children as they grow up, charting and analysing influences on their development.

“It’s important data collected in this study is readily available so community organisations and government agencies can apply it to policy and practice.”

The Government recently committed $6.4 million to the study, in Budget 2013.

Around 7,000 children born in Auckland and the Waikato in 2009 and 2010, and their families are participating in the study.

The study aims to provide New Zealand-specific information about dynamic and static factors which influence children’s development.

More than $26 million in Government funds have been committed since the study began.

“There are necessarily high expectations this investment will deliver results, with robust information that can be used to inform policy,” says Mrs Bennett.
