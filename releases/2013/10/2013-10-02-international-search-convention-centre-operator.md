Following initial engagement with five shortlisted consortia for the master planning and development of Christchurch’s Convention Centre Precinct, an operator will now be sought for the facility.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says this is a significant step forward in a project that will have huge benefits for tourism in Canterbury and the South Island.

“We know that the conference visitor spends more than the leisure visitor, and many conference visitors will return to a city with friends or family members on holiday, so this is a very important market for the region.

“We will be spreading the net wide to ensure we find an operator that has the right skills and experience to take maximum advantage of the significant opportunities this new Convention Centre Precinct will provide,” Mr Brownlee says.

A document will be released on the GETS (Government Electronic Tenders Service) website inviting Expressions of Interest (EOI) for Operator Services for the new Convention Centre early this month.

“The selected operator will give advice to the Christchurch Central Development Unit (CCDU) and work alongside the Preferred Consortia in the master planning and development of the new Convention Centre Precinct, and may carry through to operate the centre,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Government committed to funding the $284 million Convention Centre in the recent cost sharing agreement with the Christchurch City Council, and further funding options will be explored as we progress with the master planning.

“This is a large and complex project, but we remain on track to have the doors open in early 2017,” Mr Brownlee says.

A Detailed Business Case is being completed for the new precinct.
