Work towards the National War Memorial Park is progressing well and is on target to be open in time to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on 25 April 2015, Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee and Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson said today on a visit to the construction site in Wellington’s Buckle Street.

The underpass and National War Memorial Park is the Government’s cornerstone project to acknowledge the Centenary of the First World War (the WW100 programme). 

Mr Brownlee and Mr Finlayson inspected the trench which has been fully dug in order to underground the stretch of State highway 1 along Buckle Street, allowing a park space for contemplation and commemoration in front of the National War Memorial.

The Ministers were briefed by the Memorial Park Alliance, which is developing the underpass, which includes the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) and Downer Construction.  The Ministry for Culture and Heritage has responsibility for developing the park itself.

The Government’s focus for centenary commemorations will in large part be domestic, with many commemorations taking place at the National War Memorial Park.

The National War Memorial Park will strengthen the existing National War Memorial as the principle place for New Zealanders’ commemoration of service and sacrifice in time of war, and provide a place to mark the enduring relationships forged between New Zealand and other nations during that time. 

The underpass will fully integrate with the proposed Basin Reserve Transport Improvements and also with the existing road layout.

Moving State highway 1 underground will create an appropriately peaceful environment, for quiet contemplation and remembrance in the park and the War Memorial precinct.  It will also improve the environment for the neighbouring community.
