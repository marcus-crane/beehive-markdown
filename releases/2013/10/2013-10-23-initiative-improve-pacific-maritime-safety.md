Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says a new methodology to help decision makers prioritise areas for hydrographic survey will make inroads toward improving maritime safety in the South-West Pacific.

Land Information New Zealand has developed a hydrography risk assessment methodology that will highlight areas of comparative risk.

It was applied in a Vanuatu pilot in 2012. It highlighted areas of concern where expertise and assistance is needed to ensure compliance with international conventions, and to build in-country capability and capacity.

“Maritime safety is a major concern in the South-West Pacific, with many official charts failing to meet the contemporary safety or operational needs of shipping in the area,” Mr Williamson says.

This problem has been exacerbated by an increase in the number of large cruise vessels visiting the region and navigating in poorly charted areas.

“This methodology developed by LINZ will allow government officials, with the support of regional charting authorities, to prioritise areas for hydrographic survey, and determine the nature and scope of chart improvements.

“The methodology is supported and endorsed by international technical and regulatory organisations and donor funders,” Mr Williamson says.

Further risk assessments are planned for the region, including the Cook Islands and Tonga.

***This initiative has received funding support from the New Zealand Aid Programme as part of the Pacific Maritime Safety Programme.***
