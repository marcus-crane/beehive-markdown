Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the first 21 schools in New Zealand to sign agreements with Network for Learning (N4L) to connect to its managed network.

“The first three to be connected by December and take advantage of Government funding for a managed network package are West Auckland’s Massey Primary School, South Canterbury’s Waimate High School and Wanaka’s Mt Aspiring College,” Ms Kaye says.

“There are 18 other schools to be connected by the end of the year.

“N4L will connect schools together via a secure data network, offering higher levels of service, quality and support than ever before to improve learning outcomes.

“I know that many schools are looking forward to being connected as soon as possible to benefit from the Crown offer of free broadband. Network for Learning advises me that the rollout needs to be progressive, balanced and timed to each school’s needs.

“N4L selects the time to connect schools in consultation with Telecom and N4L has told me that through the registration process they are ensuring that the initial schools to be connected are diverse in terms of type, location and size.

“As I get around the country visiting schools I meet many teachers, students and parents who are eager to be connected.

“This Government has committed $211 million, over the next eight years, to deliver a funded package of fast, high-quality connections with uncapped data to schools. This is critical to ensuring young people can achieve their full potential in an increasingly digital world.

“By the end of 2014, 700 schools will be connected to the managed network, and 2016 will see all schools invited to connect.

“There has been an overwhelming response to the managed network with more than 1700 schools registering interest since it was announced in August this year.

“Network for Learning is committed to connecting schools across the country, whether they are an urban school such as Massey Primary, or a rural school such as Waimate High.

“Combined with the investment in fibre connections to schools and the School Network Upgrade Programme (SNUP), the Government’s commitment to fund schools into the managed network represents a total investment of more than $700 million in digital infrastructure.

“By 2016 schools, teachers and students right across New Zealand will be taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by digital technology,” Ms Kaye says.

The other schools to be connected by the end of 2013 are: Bream Bay College Ruakaka; Māngere Central School Auckland; Hukanui School Hamilton; Morrinsville College; Rotorua Intermediate; Selwyn School Rotorua; Stratford Primary School; Frimley School Hastings; St Peter’s College Palmerston North; Cannons Creek School Porirua; Heretaunga College Upper Hutt; Churton Park School Wellington; Springlands School Blenheim; Grovetown School Marlborough; Oamaru Intermediate; Omokoroa School; Bayfield High School Dunedin; and Otatara School.
