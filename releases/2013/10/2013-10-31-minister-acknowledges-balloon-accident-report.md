Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has expressed his deep sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives in the January 2012 Carterton hot air balloon accident, following the release today of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission’s report into the incident.

“I acknowledge the Transport Accident Investigation Commission’s recommendations are important, and I’ve asked the Ministry of Transport to give them careful consideration,” Mr Brownlee says.

“There should be zero tolerance of operator impairment, where members of the public are being transported by land, sea, rail or air.

“I will await advice from the Ministry of Transport on whether legislative change is required to address the Commission’s recommendations, and I would expect to report any proposals to Cabinet in early 2014.”
