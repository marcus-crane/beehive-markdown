Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Antarctica for the first time on Monday.

“As the minister responsible for New Zealand’s Antarctic affairs, I look forward to seeing our operations in Scott Base first hand,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand plays a leadership role on Antarctic issues, backstopped by a world-class science programme. Our position as an Antarctic gateway means New Zealand has direct environmental, economic, security and political interests associated with the continent.”

Mr McCully will also visit neighbouring United States base McMurdo Station.

New Zealand and the United States have shared logistics for Antarctic operations in Christchurch and on Ross Island since 1958.
