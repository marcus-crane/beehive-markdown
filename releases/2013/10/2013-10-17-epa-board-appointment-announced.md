Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced the appointment of a new member to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Board.

“I am pleased to announce the appointment of Dr Nicola Crauford to the EPA Board.  She will bring considerable expertise to the collective skills of the Board,” Ms Adams says.

Dr Crauford has a wealth of experience in governance and decision-making for large organisations.  Her early career in the oil and gas industry will greatly assist the Board with the EPA’s new functions under the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012.

Dr Crauford is Deputy Chief Executive of the Institution of Professional Engineers and has previously held senior positions with the Institute of Directors (Chief Executive Officer), and Transpower (General Manager Strategic Services). 

“Dr Crauford’s appointment fills a gap on the Board, following the decision of Graham Pinnell to not seek reappointment.  The appointment is for a term of three years.

"I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Mr Pinnell for his role with the Board. As a founding member of the EPA Board, he played a leading role in creating such a well-functioning organisation.

“The EPA has gained significantly from his experience and I am grateful for his valuable contribution.”

The current EPA Board is:

Kerry Prendergast (Chair), Dr Kevin Thompson (Deputy Chair), Anake Goodall, Tim Lusk, Taria Tahana, Gillian Wratt, Andrew von Dadelszen and Nicola Crauford.
