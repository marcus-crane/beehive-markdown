Environment Minister and Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Amy Adams has today congratulated Environment Canterbury commissioners for adopting a programme that will help ensure the recovery of Canterbury’s natural environment.

Ms Adams has recently been given responsibility in relation to the Natural Environment Recovery Programme by Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

“The measures in this programme will help ensure the recovery and enhancement of Canterbury’s natural environment such as the land, waterways, native flora and fauna.

“The Natural Environment Recovery Programme looks at different options to address issues that have emerged because of the Canterbury earthquakes.

“Environment Canterbury has worked widely with the community to develop the programme, which focuses on 17 projects ranging from reducing flood risk, stormwater management, wetland restoration, weed and pest control, to managing earthquake waste and contaminated sites.”

Ms Adams says while the Natural Environment Recovery Programme is not a regulatory document, it brings together existing statutory plans and connects with other recovery programmes. It also has a role in monitoring and measuring progress in the recovery of the natural environment.

“I would like to thank Environment Canterbury, its partner organisations, and the groups and individuals who have thought long and hard about what is really important to our community. We can look forward to new opportunities for Canterbury’s natural environment to flourish.”
