Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today released the Youth Crime Action Plan, which aims to reduce offending by children and young people over the next ten years.

“New Zealand’s youth justice system is one of the best in the world, but we can’t rest on our laurels,” says Mr Borrows.

“This plan brings together the gains we’ve made in youth justice recently, through initiatives like our Fresh Start reforms, Policing Excellence and the Children’s Action Plan, and looks at the gaps, challenges and opportunities that remain.

The Youth Crime Action Plan will be an important part in achieving the Government’s Better Public Service target of a 25 per cent reduction in serious youth crime.  This target was increased from the five per cent interim target earlier this year due to strong progress already being made by the sector.

“Our 25 per cent target is a very ambitious one.  YCAP identifies the opportunities we must seize, and the challenges we must address, to reach it.

“For example, the number of young people appearing before the youth court is down 19 per cent from June 2011 to June 2013.  YCAP recognises that spending less time responding to youth crime gives us the opportunity to spend more time preventing youth crime.

“It also reflects the fact that young Māori are still over-represented in the justice system, and we need to redouble our efforts to address this.  Key to this is the way we engage with iwi, hapū, and other Māori groups looking to help their rangatahi who are getting into trouble.”

The plan identifies three overarching strategies that will shape how youth crime is tackled over the next decade.

- Partnering with Communities: this seeks to improve the way government agencies engage with and support communities to prevent offending and reoffending.
- Reducing Escalation: this aims to ensure children and young people are dealt with at the lowest appropriate level of the youth justice system.
- Early and Sustainable Exits: this seeks to provide young people who offend with the best type of intervention at the right time.

The plan includes 30 practical actions that government agencies will put in place over the next two years. It also promises improved support for those who work with young people, through better leadership, coordination and information.

As part of the Partnering with Communities strategy, Mr Borrows announced a $400,000 ‘innovation fund’ to fund community based youth justice initiatives.

“Partnering with Communities has to mean a genuine partnership with communities.  The innovation fund will allow us to back small local projects that might not fall neatly into one Government silo or another, but which experience tells us can sometimes yield huge gains for a particular community,” says Mr Borrows.

“The plan does not contain a solitary ‘silver bullet’.  Instead, it embraces the hard work of improving the way we work at every stage, making the small changes that will help make the big difference in the lives of our most troubled young people.”
