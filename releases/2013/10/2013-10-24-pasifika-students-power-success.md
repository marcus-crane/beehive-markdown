Over 1600 Pasifika students, parents and family members have signed up to a new programme to boost the number of Pasifika students achieving NCEA. 

Education and Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Hekia Parata, who visited a session in Porirua last night, says *Pasifika Power Up for NCEA,* is connecting Pacific parents, families and communities with their children’s learning.

“There are eight Power Stations established in churches, community centres and schools - positive places for students and their families to learn how best to plan, prepare and study for NCEA,” Ms Parata says. 

The programme has started with an eight week study course specifically for young people sitting NCEA this year, together with their parents and families. The vision is that by the end of the course, everyone in the family will feel much more confident and able to support their young people as NCEA exams begin.

“The exciting bonus I saw last night, was younger brothers and sisters coming along – from toddlers to early teens – and engaging in their own learning activities, while Mum and Dad and grandparents were being guided on how to put together a whole family education plan”, Ms Parata says.

“The 2012 NCEA Level 2 achievement results for Pasifika students are moving in the right direction with more than an 8 per cent increase over three years (64.8 per cent of Pasifika achieving NCEA Level 2 compared to 56.5 per cent in 2009). However, there is plenty of room for improvement.

“The Pacific population is young and fast growing. These students have an important role to play in the future prosperity of New Zealand. We need to act now to make sure they have the skills and qualifications they need to contribute.

“NCEA is an important step in providing greater choices and opportunities for students. That is why the Government is committed to reaching the Better Public Services goal of 85 per cent of 18-year olds achieving NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification by 2017.”

*Pasifika Power Up for NCEA* is a joint initiative between the Ministries of Education and Pacific Island Affairs. It is part of the implementation of the Government’s Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017.
