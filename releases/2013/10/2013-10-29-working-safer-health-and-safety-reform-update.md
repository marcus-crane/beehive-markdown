Labour Minister Simon Bridges has today given an update on the implementation of *Working Safer,* the Government’s health and safety reform package.

The reform package announced in August 2013 will be reflected in the Health and Safety Reform Bill which is expected to be introduced to Parliament by the end of the year.

A draft of provisions released today covers the duties of workplace participants and provisions relating to worker participation systems that will be in the Bill.

“All the policy decisions are made – the draft gives an early indication of what the core obligations under the new law are likely to look like to implement those decisions,” says Mr Bridges.

“It will also provide an initial opportunity for key stakeholders to comment on the drafting of the provisions before the select committee process begins. The select committee will also invite and consider submissions from the public on the Bill.”

Submissions to the exposure draft close on 15 November 2013.

As part of the *Working Safer* work plan the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) will also be developing two tranches of regulations.

“The first tranche will be developed in time to accompany the new Health and Safety at Work Act when it comes into force in 2015. Tranche two will then follow within two years,” says Mr Bridges.

Tranche one will develop new regulations for *general risk and workplace management; worker representation and participation; major hazard facilities; and hazardous substances* while also updating existing regulations for *Asbestos.*

Tranche two will focus on *hazardous work; plant and structures; geothermal operations; quarries;* and any residual issues in relation to the management of hazardous substances in the workplace.

The Health and Safety Reform Bill will amend the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 and the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and replace the Health and Safety in Employment Act with a new law called the Health and Safety at Work Act.
