Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $28,500 funding to help send 12 young environmental leaders to the Auckland Islands on a Young Blake Expedition programme.

“I am allocating this grant to the Sir Peter Blake Trust to enable these young leaders to go on the expedition to the beautiful and remote sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands in February 2014,” Ms Kaye says.

“The participants will help draft a feasibility study for the establishment of a research station.

“The group of 12 young people, aged 16 to 18 years, will join leading scientists, conservationists and researchers from the New Zealand Antarctic Research Institute, Department of Conservation and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric on board HMNZS WELLINGTON.

“The Sir Peter Blake Trust is an organisation focused on inspiring, training and promoting leadership qualities, honoring Sir Peter's leadership, love for the environment, and dedication to young people.

“This money will help the Young Blake Expedition programme to provide life-changing experiences for New Zealand's next generation of leaders. Through the programme, young people will be challenged, grow in confidence and have the opportunity to contribute back to their communities.

“This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for young Kiwis to carry on Sir Peter Blake’s environmental legacy,” Ms Kaye says.

The Ministry of Youth Development funds different types of programmes. These include projects initiated and led by young people, projects in partnership with local councils and programmes and services delivered by community-based organisations.
