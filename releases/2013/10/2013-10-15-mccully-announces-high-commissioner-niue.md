Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of Superintendent Ross Ardern as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Niue.

“Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974 and we have a strong shared history,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand and Niue are working together to develop the island’s tourism potential and to build economic sustainability. This year Niue is on track to see a 32 per cent increase in tourist numbers.

“Mr Ardern will work with Niue authorities to help support the island’s increasingly vibrant economy and to address the challenges that come with growth.”

Mr Ardern has extensive experience in the Pacific, including roles as the New Zealand Police Liaison Officer for the South Pacific in Samoa and Chief of Police in Niue.
