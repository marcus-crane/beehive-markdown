Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson and Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia today announced a review has begun into building access for disabled people.

The review will look into how New Zealand Standard 4121, which outlines how people with disabilities can access buildings, aligns with the Building Code and how the Code more generally represents the needs of disabled people.

“This work has come out of recent announcements on earthquake-prone building policy, particularly around upgrading buildings with regard to access for disabled people.” Mr Williamson says.

“We must value the contribution and participation of all citizens and ensure that our buildings are accessible for everyone, including those who live with disability. It is not acceptable that disabled people are excluded from working and living in buildings because the access is inadequate, unsafe or not suitable,” Mrs Turia says.

“The impact on a disabled person and their family is quite significant when their choices in life are limited because of lack of access. We should do all that we can to ensure they have the same choices as abled bodied people,” Mrs Turia says.

New Zealand Standard 4121 was last updated 12 years ago. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is leading the review and will look at the current regulatory situation as well as consulting extensively with groups that represent the interests of disabled people, Building Consent Authorities, and building designers.
