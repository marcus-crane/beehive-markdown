West Coast cancer patients who travel to Christchurch for surgery and treatment have welcomed the support of a local cancer nurse coordinator who is streamlining their appointments and care.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says West Coast District Health Board cancer nurse coordinator Andrea Reilly is making a real difference to patients and their families in the West Coast community.

“Andrea is the link that has been missing for West Coast patients struggling to understand complex medical jargon and juggle appointments on both sides of the Southern Alps,” says Mr Ryall.

For Greymouth resident Margaret Steers, diagnosed with breast cancer on her 60th birthday in June, Andrea’s support was critical to her ability to cope with the devastating news, and the turmoil that followed.

Mrs Steers says, “I had a family history of breast cancer and needed a double mastectomy. It was just wonderful to have the backing of Andrea and know that she was with me all the way. She could answer all my questions and was always there to help me, even if I just needed someone to talk to.

“My cancer surgery came at a time when I was also waiting for a knee replacement, so Andrea made sure I didn’t lose my place on the waiting list – and I have since had that surgery too. Now I feel just wonderful.”

In Budget 2012, the Government allocated $4 million a year to ensure every district health board has at least one dedicated nurse to coordinate care and support for individual patients throughout the course of their cancer treatment.

Andrea Reilly is one of 57 cancer nurse coordinators working in full time and part time positions in district health boards throughout the country.
