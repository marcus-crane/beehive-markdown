Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman and Police Minister Anne Tolley welcome the introduction of new meritorious service medals to recognise outstanding service by personnel in the NZ Defence Force and NZ Police.

“We have some great people in the Defence Force, and it is important to recognise and reward outstanding service,” says Dr Coleman.

“The New Zealand Defence Meritorious Service Medal can be awarded in circumstances where personnel demonstrate exceptional performance, commitment or innovation. The medal is open to all Defence Force personnel regardless of rank, length of service or whether they are military or civilian.”

The New Zealand Police Meritorious Service Medal can be awarded by the Police Commissioner to any Police employee. It will not necessarily be awarded for acts of bravery which are recognised within existing awards. There is also provision for posthumous awards to be made.

“Our Police staff show courage, dedication and professionalism every single day, and it is fitting that all employees are eligible for this new medal,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Criteria includes high performance, innovation and inspiration, dedication to serving communities and applying sound professional judgement in difficult circumstances.”

The NZ Defence Meritorious Service Medal replaces the NZ Meritorious Service Medal which was only available to Regular Force non-commissioned officers and warrant officers who completed 21 years’ service. There was also a limit on the number of awards available.

“The old meritorious service medal carried a number of restrictions which have been lifted under the guidelines for the new medal. The NZ Defence Meritorious Service Medal also fills a gap which has existed for some time in the range of honours and awards available to the Defence Force,” says Dr Coleman.
