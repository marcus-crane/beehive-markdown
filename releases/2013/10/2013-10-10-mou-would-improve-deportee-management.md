Justice Minister Judith Collins says a Memorandum of Understanding between New Zealand and Australia would improve the process through which New Zealand Police access Australian deportation and conviction information.

Ms Collins discussed the development of an MOU with new Minister of Justice for Australia, Hon Michael Keenan, today as part of a meeting of the Standing Council on Law and Justice (SCLJ) in Sydney.

“In light of the ‘Bayliss’ case I asked my officials for advice around improving the management of New Zealanders who are charged and convicted in Australia and deported back to New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

“There is currently an ad hoc process for New Zealand Police to access deportation and conviction information from Australian authorities. This is partly due to deportation and conviction information being held by different Australian agencies.

“Currently Australian Immigration authorities notify New Zealand Police when a New Zealander is deported because their visa is revoked on the basis that they do not pass the character test. A person may fail the character test on a number of grounds, including where a person has a conviction resulting in a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more. Criminal history information is held by an agency called Crimtrac for all Australian states. New Zealand Police can request records from Crimtrac through Interpol.

“The Bayliss case raised several issues of concern to me. In particular, the supervision of New Zealanders who are deported after serving a prison sentence in another jurisdiction.

“Earlier this year the Government passed the Privacy Amendment Act. This law change allows information to be disclosed to an individual where there is a serious threat to the life or health of that person or another person. Previously a threat had to be both serious and imminent.

“I have also asked my officials to analyse the adequacy of existing or proposed supervision or monitoring orders for offenders who return to New Zealand.

“I have requested advice on the number of offenders deported to New Zealand, and their impact on the community. Ministry of Justice officials are working with Police and other agencies to gather this information.

“It’s critical that New Zealand authorities have timely access to deportation and conviction information to properly manage offenders who are deported back to New Zealand.”

Ms Collins says Police will lead the development of the MOU in consultation with Immigration New Zealand and the Ministry of Justice.

To receive information from Australia under an MOU, New Zealand does not need to make any law changes. However the MOU would not come into force until Australian changes to its Privacy Act to clarify information sharing by law enforcement agencies come into effect in March next year.
