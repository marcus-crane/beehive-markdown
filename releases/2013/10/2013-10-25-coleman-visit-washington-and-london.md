Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman will travel to Washington this weekend for bilateral talks with US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Monday.

“New Zealand’s defence relationship with the United States is in great shape. I’m looking forward to discussing with Secretary Hagel how we can build on the achievements made in the last year,” says Dr Coleman.

“We have accomplished a number of milestones since the signing of the Washington Declaration in 2012, which set out regular high level dialogue and enhanced co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region.

“Leon Panetta’s visit to New Zealand last year was the first visit by a US Secretary of Defense in 30 years. We also held inaugural defence policy talks and conducted a number of exercises together. We are working together more closely than we have in decades, and we expect to maintain that tempo of activity in the future.”

Dr Coleman will also travel to London to attend the Open Government Partnership summit from 31 October – 1 November 2013. The Open Government Partnership is an international forum established in 2011 with the aim of making member governments more open, accountable and responsive.
