Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced Government approval to implement a single application process and single examination process for New Zealand and Australian patent applications.

The single trans-Tasman processes for patent application, along with the passing of the Patents Bill, are part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda initiatives to encourage and support innovative industries.

“Single patent application and examination processes will enable the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) and IP Australia to share resources, reduce duplication and cut administrative costs to improve patent examination outcomes,” says Mr Foss.

“Around 5700 applications filed with IPONZ are also the subject of a corresponding application in Australia and forty per cent of applicants also nominate the same patent attorney for both applications.

“Using an online portal hosted on the IPONZ and IP Australia websites, applicants will be able to apply for patent protection simultaneously in Australia and New Zealand, while a single examiner will assess both applications according to the respective laws.

“The joint processes will mean that more businesses can reduce compliance costs by employing a single patent attorney to manage both applications.

“Two separate and independent patents will ultimately be granted and IPONZ and IP Australia will each retain their existing responsibilities for granting or refusing the patents,” says Mr Foss.
