Three new social housing developments in Christchurch totalling 51 homes and an investment of $17.3 million were announced today by Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith.

“We have a real housing challenge in Christchurch with the loss of so many homes to the earthquakes and the increased demand from the expanded workforce to support the rebuild. This shortage is driving up house prices and rents. These new developments are about ensuring an increased supply of lower cost homes for both rental and assisted home ownership,” Dr Smith says.

“The Government is partnering with The Canterbury Community Trust to help fund these developments and with community housing providers Accessible Properties, Comcare Trust and Habitat for Humanity to deliver them. This reflects the Government’s new direction in social housing of expanding the community sector.”

The funding to support the projects is $8.7 million from the Government’s Social Housing Fund, $4.3 million from The Canterbury Community Trust and $4.3 million from the community social housing providers.

Comcare Trust has received $1.8 million from the Social Housing Unit (SHU) and $926,000 from The Canterbury Community Trust (TCCT) to build 14 units (20 bedrooms) for individuals who experience mental illness and/or addictions. The total value of the housing developments is $3.7 million.

Accessible Properties has received $3 million from SHU and $1.5 million from TCCT to build 16 units (32 bedrooms) in Linwood, Phillipstown and St Albans for high-need tenants displaced due to affordability and homelessness. The total value of the developments is $5.9 million.

Habitat for Humanity has received $3.8 million from SHU and $1.9 million from TCCT to build 21 units (84 bedrooms) in Avonside, Bromley, Linwood and Kaiapoi for families who have experienced transience, sub-standard housing and overcrowding as a result of the earthquakes. The total value of the developments is $7.7 million.

The Canterbury Community Trust’s funding comes from their one-off $25 million Special Fund aimed at rebuilding the fabric of Canterbury communities and supporting the social infrastructure of Christchurch.

“These approved projects are worthy of support and will be a step in the right direction to changing the face of social housing in Christchurch,” trustee Sue McKenzie says.

“In many cases the housing itself is just one factor in the complex needs of social housing tenants. As an example, Comcare who provides community mental health support services, has indicated that post-earthquake their housing referrals are up by as much as 70 per cent,” Mrs McKenzie says.

“We need to take a collaborative approach if we are going to affect real and sustainable change. Our partnership with the Government is one of the steps we are taking to make a real difference for our community,” she says.

“These new community housing developments are further steps on the long road to recovering Christchurch’s housing stock. They complement Housing New Zealand’s programme of completing repairs on its 5,000 damaged homes and the 700 new builds by the end of 2015. The Government has also built four temporary accommodation villages, partnered with the private sector to provide worker accommodation, and assisted more than 3,300 families through the Christchurch Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service,” Dr Smith says.
