Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says that the safety of prison staff is being enhanced, following recommendations from an expert advisory panel.

The panel, chaired by former Police Commissioner Howard Broad, was set up at the end of last year to review and support the implementation of the Department’s Staff Safety Action Plan. It consulted extensively with staff, unions, stakeholders and other Government agencies.

As a result, the Plan has now been updated and revised, as Corrections targets a 50 per cent reduction in staff assaults by 2015, and is being promoted during Staff Safety Week which runs until 11 October.

In the financial year 2011/12 there were 18 serious assaults on staff, 13 last year, and one in the year to date.

“Prisons can often be dangerous and unpredictable environments, and Corrections will continue to do everything it can to ensure the safety of staff,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The expert panel has endorsed the Staff Safety Action Plan and the changes planned by Corrections, as well as recommending enhancements.”

Changes include:

- Increased training and mentoring for new custodial staff.

- A pilot mental health awareness programme for staff in high risk areas, to help identify disorders and improve safety for staff and offenders.

<!--THE END-->

- A safety training package for community based staff, to support awareness, tactical communication and techniques to deal with aggressive situations.

- Improving accessibility of handcuffs for custodial staff in high risk areas, and investigating the use of on-body cameras to support evidence-gathering and future training.

“This National-led Government has already supported a range of new initiatives to boost staff safety,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This includes Tactical Exit Training for 4000 frontline prison staff, and the introduction of training and access to pepper spray for use as a tactical option.

“We’ve also introduced batons, spit-hoods and stab-resistant vests for staff working in high-risk situations.

“It is impossible to eliminate all risk in prisons, given the volatile nature of some of the offenders, but Corrections will always look at ways to minimise the risk for our frontline staff, who are doing a fantastic job.”
