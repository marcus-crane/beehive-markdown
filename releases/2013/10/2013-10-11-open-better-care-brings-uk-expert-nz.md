A leading UK barrister, who specialises in medical negligence, is in New Zealand sharing his experiences on how to prevent patient harm.

Robert Francis QC chaired an inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire National Health Service Foundation Trust which found numerous failings in the quality of care provided to patients.

Mr Francis is the keynote speaker for a health quality and safety forum in Wellington on the 14 October. While in the country, he will also meet with Ministers to discuss the lessons from the Mid Staffordshire inquiry.

“While it is very unlikely a scenario like Mid Staffordshire would be replicated in New Zealand, a lot of the key messages to come out of the inquiry will resonate with health leaders in New Zealand,” says Mr Ryall.

“Mr Francis recommendations emphasise the importance of creating a culture that respects patients and their families, is open to learning from others and improving the way things are done, and has strong clinical leadership.

“We have an excellent health system in New Zealand and we need to keep improving the quality of care we offer patients

“The launch of the national patient safety campaign Open for Better Care and the annual reporting of events involving serious patient harm shows the importance being placed on the quality agenda here in New Zealand,” says Mr Ryall.

Robert Francis has been brought to New Zealand by a partnership between Waitemata District Health Board, the Health Quality & Safety Commission, and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care.
