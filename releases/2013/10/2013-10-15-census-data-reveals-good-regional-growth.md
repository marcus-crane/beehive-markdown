Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says the latest release of information from the 2013 Census shows good growth in the regions.

Statistics New Zealand today published detailed population information about regional council, territorial authority, area unit and Auckland local board counts.

“The information shows all but one region grew in population size since 2006. Regions that grew by four per cent or more were Auckland, Nelson, Waikato, Tasman, Taranaki, Wellington, Otago, and Bay of Plenty. Most other regions grew by two per cent or more.

“Auckland has grown by 110,000 (1.2 per cent per annum) to 1.42 million people since 2006. At this level of growth Auckland will not have another one million people in 30 years as planners have projected, and the population is more likely to be at the two million mark by then.

“I hope councils around the country will use today’s information to help plan accurately for the future,” Maurice Williamson says.

At a district level Selwyn, Queenstown-Lakes, Waimakariri and Carterton have been the fastest growing districts in the country.

On December 3rd, more detailed information on age, sex, location and ethnicity breakdowns at a national level will be published by Statistics New Zealand.
