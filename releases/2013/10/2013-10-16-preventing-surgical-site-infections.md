Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew welcomes the second phase of the national patient safety campaign, *Open for better care,* which focuses on reducing harm from infections in patients following surgery.

“Reducing the number of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) in our hospitals is a priority for patient safety”, says Mrs Goodhew.

“This campaign will support the Surgical Site Infection Improvement Programme (SSIIP), which was rolled out across the country earlier this year.”

International research suggests that up to five per cent of surgeries can result in a person suffering from an SSI.

“SSI rates in New Zealand are now being collected as part of the SSIIP, and data will be available on hip and knee replacements from next year.

“Choosing SSI prevention as the second focus area of the *Open for better care* campaign highlights how important it is for hospital health care workers to take simple actions that can make a real difference to patient safety.

“Actions that can help prevent SSIs include good hand hygiene, giving patients the right antibiotic at the right time, and using appropriate skin preparations before surgery,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The national patient safety campaign, *Open for better care,* focuses on four areas where evidence shows it is possible to reduce patient harm – falls, infections, surgery and medication.

*Open for better care* is being coordinated nationally by the Health Quality & Safety Commission.
