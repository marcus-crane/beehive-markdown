Education Minister Hekia Parata says nine people have been appointed to the Aranui Community Leadership Group (ACLG), established to lead community consultation on the year 1-13 Aranui campus announced last month.

“Members were selected following registrations of interest received from the Aranui community. The members of the group were chosen because of their experience and commitment to the community,” says Ms Parata. 

“They all have strong connections to Aranui. Some live or work in the community at the moment while others were raised there and are really keen to give something back.

“They have a variety of skills and are from a range of different backgrounds including teaching and education, health care, community development and support work, voluntary work, and the business sector.

Ms Parata says from now until December the ACLG will lead consultation with the Aranui community on the organisation of the campus, schooling provision, and the facilities and services the campus will provide for the community.

“With support from the Ministry, the ACLG will help determine what the community wants the campus to offer Aranui children and students, the vision for the campus, and what services and facilities the community would like included to meet their needs and aspirations.

Ms Parata says it will also identify the way the campus should be organised – for example a year 1-13 school or a junior / middle /senior model, or an alternative. In addition, it will bring together the community’s views on schooling provision, including bilingual, kura and special education, tertiary or business subjects, adult learning, social and support services, and community use.

The ACLG will:

- lead the consultation and engagement on the year 1-13 campus with the Aranui community
- ensure consultation and engagement is effective and takes account of the cultural diversity within the Aranui community
- be responsible for communication with the community about the campus
- work closely with the four closing Aranui schools and their governance during consultation, and until they close in 2017
- work closely with the campus Establishment Board of Trustees (EBoT) until the new campus opens in 2017.

“Once again, I want to thank communities in Aranui and New Brighton for their involvement in this process. They have put enormous work into their submissions and their feedback has been invaluable throughout this past 12 months of extensive consultation.”
