Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew is pleased to announce that Auckland’s over 65s will now be able to access SuperGold information in other languages.

“We want more of our older people to take advantage of the benefits this card has to offer”, says Mrs Goodhew.

“The information has been translated into Chinese (simplified and traditional), Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Korean, Samoan and Tongan which were identified as Auckland’s largest ethnic groups.”

Mervin Singham, Director of The Office of Ethnic Affairs is delighted with this initiative to improve access to information for Aucklanders.

"People from more than 200 different ethnicities live in New Zealand, and Auckland is the country’s most ethnically diverse city.

“For example, the city’s Asian population is expected to grow from 20 per cent to 33 per cent,” says Mr Singham.

Auckland is also home to the largest Polynesian population in the world, with two thirds of New Zealand’s Pacific people.

“I have made it my mission to increase the awareness of the value seniors can get with their SuperGold Cards and this includes reaching those for whom English may be a second language”, says Mrs Goodhew.

“Access to transport plays a key role in helping older people remain actively connected to their communities and families, and is an effective way to help address social isolation.

“With more than 10,000 business outlets across the country now offering discounts to SuperGold Card holders, there’s a wealth of saving opportunities available to older New Zealanders”, says Mrs Goodhew.
