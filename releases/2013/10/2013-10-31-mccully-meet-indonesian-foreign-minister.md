Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and his Indonesian counterpart, Marty Natalegawa, will meet in Auckland today for the sixth annual Indonesia-New Zealand Joint Ministerial Commission.

“Indonesia is of growing importance regionally and internationally and is on track to be the world’s seventh largest economy by 2030,” Mr McCully says.

“These annual talks demonstrate the significance New Zealand places on our relationship with Indonesia, and allows us to take stock of the growing political ties between our two countries.

“Indonesia took a strong leadership role in South East Asia during its time as Chair of APEC, and we welcome on-going efforts to promote regionalism and strengthen governance in the Asia-Pacific region.

“Indonesia is one of our major trading partners in South East Asia. We export more than $800 million annually to Indonesia and there is huge potential for this to grow.

“We also cooperate closely on development issues and New Zealand’s country aid programme in Indonesia is our largest outside the Pacific."
