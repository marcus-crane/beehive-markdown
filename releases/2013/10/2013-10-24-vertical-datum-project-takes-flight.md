Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced a project to gather national gravity data and to improve the accuracy of the New Zealand Vertical Datum 2009 has entered a new phase, with initial aerial surveying more than half complete.

Used to reference heights in New Zealand, its offshore islands and the continental shelf, the NZVD2009 was established using historical gravity data that wasn’t collected with the intent of using it for height system definition.

“An accurate national vertical datum is essential to enable the accurate integration of geospatial data and the determination of global change, such as sea level rise.

“Land Information New Zealand, with GNS Science and Victoria University, is currently collecting a national airborne gravity dataset. It’s the first time this information has been collected on such a large scale,” Mr Williamson says.

The data will be used to improve the accuracy of the national geoid, which enables GNSS (GPS) receivers to determine heights in relation to sea level, to an accuracy of two to three centimetres.

The survey capture of the country is expected to be completed by mid-2014.

“The collection and analysis of this data will ensure New Zealand has a world-class vertical datum that meets customer needs, and enables us to continue demonstrating geospatial leadership internationally,” Mr Williamson says.
