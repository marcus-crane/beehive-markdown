Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says reducing the speed limits of Christchurch’s inner-most streets will provide for a more people-focused environment in the redeveloped city.

The new 30km per hour limit is a significant factor in the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan transport chapter “An Accessible City,” released today, which explains the transport system which will support the new compact CBD core.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) has worked in partnership with Christchurch City Council, Environment Canterbury, Ngāi Tahu and the New Zealand Transport Agency, to develop the transport plan.

“We put the draft plan out for consultation last year and received 278 submissions,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Officials have since taken into account relevant studies and the extensive public engagement on the inner city in getting to today.

“A lot of work has been done to ensure the transport system fits with Anchor Projects, including the Avon River Precinct, the Bus Interchange, and also aligns with the SCIRT horizontal infrastructure rebuild programme.”

Mr Brownlee says many of the submissions made suggestions for how the inner city streets should look, and those ideas will be considered as concept designs are developed.  Key interest groups including the Automobile Association have made a range of suggestions, including the removal of traffic signals in some areas.

“Not all the suggestions will work but we are taking on board all of the advice.

“Everyone who submitted has the same focus – making central Christchurch more accessible and people-friendly.”

Key changes in the chapter include converting Kilmore and Salisbury Streets from one-way into two-way, while retaining the other one-way streets of Montreal, Durham and St Asaph with the replacement of Oxford/Lichfield onto Tuam Street.

In the coming months CERA will working closely with the Christchurch City Council to develop design guidelines, public realm network plans and a parking plan to ensure the safest and most enjoyable travel in and out of the central city.

“Overall we are trying to make the central city as attractive as possible for people to come in and shop, socialise and live, and I’m confident executing this plan will help meet that goal,” Mr Brownlee says.
