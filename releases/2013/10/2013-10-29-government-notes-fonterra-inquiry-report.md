The Government today noted the release of the Fonterra Inquiry into the Whey Protein Concentrate incident.

“The report lists a number of recommendations and I understand Fonterra has committed itself to resolving the identified issues,” Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says.

“It is important to note that this is Fonterra’s inquiry and the Government has its own inquiries underway into the incident.”

The Government’s Ministerial Inquiry is expected to deliver an interim report in mid-December, and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ compliance investigation is expected to be concluded by the end of the year.
