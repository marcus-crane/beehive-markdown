New legislation to better support current and future veterans was introduced to Parliament today by Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse.

The Veterans’ Support Bill follows a Law Commission report that provided the most comprehensive review of veterans’ entitlements since the introduction of the 1954 War Pensions Act.

“New Zealand owes a great debt to our veterans. The National-led Government is committed to honouring their service,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The new legislation delivers on our election promise. It will enable the government to better meet the needs of older veterans who require assistance to remain in their own homes.

“It will also enable us to better support veterans of modern day and future deployments who will require rehabilitation and assistance to work.”

Mr Woodhouse says no veteran will have their current entitlement reduced, and many veterans and their family members will benefit from increased entitlements, care, and support.

The new bill contains many of the same provisions as the current Act. The service eligibility criteria will remain the same and all veterans currently covered under the 1954 Act will have coverage under the new legislation. Medical treatment for accepted conditions will also continue to be funded.

“The Government has committed $60 million for a package to support the new legislation. As part of this package, we also increased the War Disablement and Surviving Spouse Pensions by 5 per cent this year, on top of inflation.

“Veterans and the wider public will have an opportunity to comment on the new legislation when the Bill is considered at Select Committee, and I encourage anyone with an interest to do so,” Mr Woodhouse says.
