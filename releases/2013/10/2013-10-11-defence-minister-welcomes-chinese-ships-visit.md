Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the visit by a Chinese Navy Task Force, and says it reflects New Zealand’s wider engagement with defence partners from the Asia-Pacific region.

“It is in New Zealand’s interests to promote greater levels of engagement with a wide range of defence partners. This visit fits into our wider regional engagement programme,” says Dr Coleman.

“The visit also reflects our growing defence engagement with China, and the wider political and economic links between our countries. It reciprocates HMNZS Te Mana’s port visits to Shanghai and Hong Kong earlier this year.”

A People’s Liberation Army Navy Task Force is conducting an extended Pacific deployment and is visiting Auckland from 11-15 October 2013. The Royal New Zealand Navy is hosting a programme of cultural and sporting activities for the Task Force’s 680 sailors.

The Task Force consists of the destroyer Qingdao, the frigate Linyi and the supply vessel Hongzehu. Recently, HMNZS Te Mana joined the Chinese Task Force along with Navy vessels from other ASEAN partners to take part in a multinational maritime security field training exercise in Australia.

“New Zealand’s defence engagement with the People’s Liberation Army has been nurtured over the past decade, along with our broader bilateral relationship,” says Dr Coleman.

“The NZDF continues to build its engagement with the People’s Liberation Army. In August, the NZDF hosted Australian, US and Chinese military personnel for the first time for Exercise Phoenix Spirit, a humanitarian and disaster relief activity.

“Next week I will be meeting with General Zhao Keshi, member of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Logistics Department. This is a key engagement opportunity, and General Zhao will be the highest ranked Chinese defence official to visit New Zealand since 2010.”
