Police Minister Anne Tolley and Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today congratulated the Police and Customs for a $2 million drug bust.

Just over two kilograms of methamphetamine, $20,000 and vehicles were seized and five people arrested in the Wellington region yesterday after a joint operation between Police and Customs.

The methamphetamine, which has a street value of $2 million, came from Hong Kong concealed in LED lighting panels.

“There is no place for these despicable drugs in our communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Police and Customs are working together to share intelligence, and they are getting great results.

“And through the Proceeds of Crime Act, we are ensuring that criminals are not profiting from this dirty business.

Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says the drug bust sends a strong warning to those involved in the drug trade that they will be caught.

“The dismantling of drug syndicates is a top priority for this Government.”
