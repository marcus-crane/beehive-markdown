Police and Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has officially opened a new joint Police station and remand centre in New Plymouth, built at a cost of $17.25 million.

It is the first time in New Zealand that Police and Corrections have joined forces to deliver frontline operations under one roof.

The New Plymouth facility is the fourteenth new Police station to open since the start of 2009, representing total building costs of over $120 million.

“This new station and remand centre will see two agencies join forces in one building and that is extremely significant,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It will mean increased collaboration between Police and Corrections staff. They will be able to share information and intelligence, and share expertise, as we work towards our common goals of safer communities, less crime, less reoffending and fewer victims of crime.

“Prisoner transportation will also be more efficient, and less frequent, meaning less risk to public safety.

“I want to thank everyone involved in the design and build of this new Police station and remand centre, and wish Police and Corrections staff a safe and successful future in their new building.”
