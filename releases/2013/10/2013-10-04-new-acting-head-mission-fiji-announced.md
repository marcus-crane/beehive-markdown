Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named Mark Ramsden as New Zealand’s new Acting Head of Mission in Fiji.

“Fiji has recently taken some positive steps toward holding free and fair elections - an extensive voter registration process has taken place; four political parties have been registered; Fiji has responded positively to the NZ/EU needs assessment on requirements for holding elections; and the final constitution has been released,” Mr McCully says.

“Mr Ramsden will have an important role in managing our relationship with Fiji as that country returns to a democratic system.”

Mr Ramsden has extensive experience in the Pacific, having previously served in Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea as well as a posting in New York.
