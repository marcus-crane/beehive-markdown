Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says four Customs cash detector dogs have found more than $1 million in undeclared or concealed cash during their first three months on the job.

Three dogs have been working at Auckland International Airport and one at Wellington International Airport.  All four dogs are also trained to detect drugs.

“Since August, these dogs have detected an amazing $1.09 million of cash at airports.  A further $102,000 has been located through search warrant activity with police.

“The movement of large sums of cash has been linked to illicit activities and criminal networks, so this added capability to sniff out undeclared or concealed money has hit criminals in the pocket and put them on notice. 

“It also sends a clear message to the public to declare cash amounts of more than $10,000.  It is Customs role to ensure money crossing the border is legitimate and is being carried for legitimate purposes.

“A fifth dog will be deployed in the South Island in 2014,” Mr Williamson says.

The dual-trained dogs can detect cash amounts of more than $10,000, targeted at New Zealand, Australian and American currencies.

A pilot earlier this year involving Customs and Police dogs saw a total of $385,000 intercepted, including one haul of $139,000.

Undeclared or misdeclared money becomes a prohibited good under the Customs and Excise Act which can result in forfeiture and seizure.   Not declaring cash or providing false or misleading information is an offence under the Anti Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act and a range of penalties can apply, including fines or prosecution.
