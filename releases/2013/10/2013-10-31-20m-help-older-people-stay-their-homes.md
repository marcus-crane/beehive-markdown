Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew today announced details on how a $20 million funding boost will help older New Zealanders stay in their own homes longer.

“A review of district health boards supply contracts for home care support prices found considerable variation across the country,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This additional funding will help address those differences by lifting the contract prices at those DHBs that were found to be paying below the national average.

“In the remaining DHBs the funding will be used to focus on those older people at home with more complex needs, for example more personal care hours and increased assessments.

“This targeted approach will see the additional funds directed to where they can be of most use,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The additional $20 million over the next four years is being distributed to DHBs based on their share of the older population.

“It’s not news that New Zealand has an ageing population. We should be celebrating that people are living longer, and helping them to stay healthy.

“Older New Zealanders should be able to stay in their own homes as long as possible. We want to support our older people to stay independent and active,” says Mrs Goodhew.

DHBs to help those with more complex needs: Auckland, Canterbury, Capital and Coast, Counties Manukau, Nelson Marlborough, South Canterbury, Taranaki, Waikato, Waitemata, and West Coast.

DHBs to lift contract prices: Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Hutt Valley,  Lakes, MidCentral, Northland, Southern, Tairawhiti, Wairarapa and Whanganui.
