New Zealand’s top researchers have been awarded a record $59m in project funding from the Marsden fund over the next three years, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today. 

The 109 successful Marsden Fund projects were selected from a pool of 1157 proposals submitted for consideration by the Marsden Fund Council. 

The Marsden Fund, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand, aims to enhance the quality of research, support the advancement of scientific knowledge in New Zealand, and contribute to the global knowledge base. The Fund is governed by the Marsden Fund Council, which is appointed by the Minister of Science and Innovation. 

“The Marsden Fund supports our brightest and best researchers – both those starting on their careers and those who are already established. Their research will help strengthen New Zealand society and increase innovation, which is key to building stronger economic growth and prosperity for New Zealanders and their families,” Mr Joyce says.

The projects to receive funding cover a wide range of topics, including: better understanding the Christchurch earthquake to mitigate earthquake hazards in similar cities; learning more about zinc therapy for autism-related disorders; and exploring how television shapes perceptions about Māori identity, particularly among Māori.

The Marsden Fund awards are split into two categories. Fast-Start awards are for early-career researchers and are worth up to $300,000 over a three-year period.  Standard awards are for all applicants and can be worth as much as $850,000 over a three-year period.

“The larger amount available this year to fund these proposals is due to the Government’s regular increases to the fund since it came into office five years ago. In Budget 2013, a further $20 million was allocated over four years to the Fund, and that has made a real difference. The Marsden Fund is now 37 per cent larger than it was in 2008/09,” Mr Joyce says.

“I’m pleased to hear that this increase in funding allowed the Marsden Fund Council to recommend an extra 22 proposals for funding this year.”
