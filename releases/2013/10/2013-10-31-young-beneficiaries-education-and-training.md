Changes to the benefit system for young people are seeing more in education, training and attending vital parenting and budgeting courses.

“Welfare reform started with young people, for good reason – a recent report found young people who go on benefit, then spend an average 19 years on benefit,” says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“We now require all beneficiary 16 and 17 year olds and teen parents to be in education or training so they have a better chance at getting a decent job.”

Since implementing the $148 million Youth Services last August, 70% of 16 and 17 year olds and 70% of teen parents (16-19 years) are now in education.

In total, of the 1,300 young 16 and 17 year old beneficiaries, 70% are in education, 22% are in training **\[1]** and 39% are doing budgeting courses (often with the Youth Service provider directly).

“We added an extra $80 million for childcare in Budget 2012 and that’s helping remove the barriers to education and training for teen parents.”

Of the 1,400 teen parents, 70% are now in education and 13% in training, with 48% doing budgeting courses and 44% doing parenting courses.

“We give youth $10 per week as an incentive payment for staying in education or training or completing three months of budgeting and/or parenting courses.”

“Now, 805 young people and teen parents are currently earning at least an extra $10 a week for doing the right thing,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We’re incentivising hard work and effort and supporting them to learn and train for a better future not just for themselves, but for their children.”

Young beneficiaries have their bills paid directly and money for essentials loaded onto a payment card which cannot be used for cigarettes or alcohol.

“Youth Providers teach young people how to manage their money and ensure the bills are paid so they can become independent,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Under the old welfare system, money would simply appear in teenage bank accounts weekly and it was assumed they knew how best to spend it.”

Minister Bennett says going on welfare is no longer an easy option for young people; now we make them work for it.

The recently released valuation of the welfare system shows an average young beneficiary has a 43% chance of being on benefit 15 years later and 25% are expected to be on a benefit 40 years after the valuation date (which was June 2012).

Youth Services are for 16 and 17 year olds on benefit (Youth Payment), 16-19 year old teen parents on benefit (Young Parent Payment) and young people classed as NEET (not in education, employment or training) not on a benefit.

Currently 59% of previously ‘NEET’ youth are enrolled in education, 17% are in training and 4% in work based learning.

“These young people by virtue of the fact they’re already disengaged from school are harder to encourage back in to the system but we’re not giving up.”

The new Youth Services were implemented in August 2012.
