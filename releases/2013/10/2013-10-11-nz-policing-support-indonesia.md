Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand is providing $6.34 million for a three-year community policing programme in Indonesia.

“The Eastern Indonesia Community Policing Programme will support the Indonesian National Police to improve community policing skills and relationships with the people of Papua, West Papua and Maluku,” Mr McCully says.

The programme will be funded by the New Zealand Aid Programme and implemented by New Zealand Police. It includes training, mentoring support, curriculum development and community engagement through collaboration with local authorities.

“This is an excellent opportunity for New Zealand to contribute to Indonesia’s peace and prosperity by improving professional community policing in eastern Indonesia,” Mr McCully says.

About the programme:

The Eastern Indonesia Community Policing Programme follows a successful pilot project in Papua and West Papua in 2009/10.

It will include two full-time New Zealand Police staff deployed to the Indonesian National Police office in Jayapura for three years.

They will be joined by two short-term specialists for key activities, and the programme will provide training for up to 1000 Indonesian National Police.
