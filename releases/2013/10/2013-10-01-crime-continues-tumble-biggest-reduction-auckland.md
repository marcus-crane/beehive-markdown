Police Minister Anne Tolley has praised frontline Police, with recorded offences down for the third fiscal year in a row, and a massive 17.4 per cent drop in crimes in the past three years.

There were 29,337 fewer recorded offences in the year to June 2013, a fall of 7.4 per cent, representing a 7.9 per cent drop per head of population.

In the past three years there were 76,775 fewer crimes, with a fall of 5.2 per cent last year, and 5.8 per cent the previous year.

“Our Police have been working hard to focus on crime prevention, and these excellent results show that their efforts are paying huge dividends,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Our frontline officers are better-resourced than ever, and are increasing their presence on the streets to prevent and tackle crime.

“Foot patrols were up 70 per cent last year, and new technology such as smartphones and tablets are allowing officers to input and access important, up to the minute information, as well as delivering over half a million additional crime prevention hours every year.”

Today’s release of the fiscal year crime statistics show significant drops in burglaries, theft, robbery and illicit drug offences across the country.

There were falls in crime in ten out of the 12 Police districts, with Auckland recording the biggest drop of 16.8 per cent.

However, there were increases in both dwelling assaults and sexual assaults.

“Both of these areas, which we know include domestic violence incidents, are under-reported, and I would continue to encourage victims to come forward,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I am assured by Police that they are continuing to treat these issues as a high priority, as they work towards compiling definitive family violence statistics.

“Once again, I want to thank officers across New Zealand for all their hard work in bringing crime down, and for the work that lies ahead to deliver even better results for the public.”
