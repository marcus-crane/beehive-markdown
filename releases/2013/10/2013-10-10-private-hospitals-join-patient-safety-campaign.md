Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today congratulated MercyAscot Hospital in Auckland for becoming the first private provider to sign the national patient safety campaign, *Open for better care*.

“The Government is committed to making our health system safer and reducing harm to patients. This is why in May this year I launched the *Open for better care* campaign,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The campaign challenges all health care workers to acknowledge mistakes and see them as an opportunity to learn, change and improve.

“Quality care and patient safety should be a priority in both public and private hospitals. With all 20 district health boards already taking part, it is extremely pleasing to see private hospitals now also getting behind the campaign.”

The *Open for better care* campaign is being led by the Health Quality & Safety Commission and is implemented regionally.

“We are focusing on four key areas - falls, surgery, infections and medication. Some of the changes to improve patient care are quite simple, such as ensuring good hand hygiene practices”, says Mrs Goodhew.

Andrew Wong, MercyAscot managing director, says the hospital is delighted to be the first private provider to sign up in support of the campaign.

“The *Open for better care* campaign supports MercyAscot’s strong focus on quality care and patient safety, and the initiatives we currently have underway”.

Mrs Goodhew noted Southern Cross Hospitals have indicated they will also sign up to the campaign, which has been endorsed by the New Zealand Private Surgical Hospitals Association.

“I look forward to other private providers following their lead in demonstrating their commitment to safer and higher quality care”.
