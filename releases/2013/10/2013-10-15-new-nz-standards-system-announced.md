Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced changes to maintain and strengthen the development and delivery of New Zealand Standards.

The announcement follows a review of New Zealand’s Standards system last year. The purpose of the review was to ensure New Zealand has an independent and sustainable standards system.

“Standards make an important contribution to a more productive and competitive economy. From product standards to building products, energy safety, health and disability, environmental management, and information technology standards,” says Mr Foss.

The review decisions include:

- A new Standards model will replace the Standards Council and Standards New Zealand.
- Standards approval will be undertaken by an independent statutory board.
- Standards development will be undertaken by an independent statutory officer within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
- Independent committees will continue to comprise industry and technical experts, consumer representatives and regulators.

“Standards improve the effectiveness, safety and reliability of many goods and services used by consumers and businesses every day and throughout our economy.

“The new model will better align Standards development with important government priorities such as innovation and trade facilitation,” says Mr Foss.

A Standards Bill is expected to be introduced to Parliament in early 2014 which will make the necessary legislative changes.

In the meantime Standards New Zealand will continue to provide support for Standards development and approval as the process continues.
