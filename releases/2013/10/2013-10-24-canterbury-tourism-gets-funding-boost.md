Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain today announced a funding package to support the ongoing recovery of the tourism sector in Christchurch and the wider Canterbury region.

$764,000 will be provided to the Canterbury Tourism Partnership by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). The Christchurch City Council and Christchurch International Airport will also be contributing $500,000 each to the Partnership.

Minister Tremain made the announcement after meeting this morning with Christchurch Mayor-elect Lianne Dalziel.

“There is no doubt that the Canterbury earthquakes have had a significant impact on the travel and tourism industry in the Canterbury region. This funding will assist the Canterbury Tourism Partnership and spread the message that the city is open for business. It is also important to note that the tourism experience in the wider region has not been adversely affected by the quakes,” says Mr Tremain.

“The Government is committed to delivering more jobs and higher incomes. Any efforts which help boost investor confidence in establishing new visitor accommodation, hospitality and retail operations in Christchurch will benefit the wider community. ”

An additional $202,000 over two years will also be provided by MBIE to Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism to co-fund a new Visitor Sector Recovery position. The position will be focused on the immediate implementation of projects in the Visitor Sector Recovery Plan, which lays out the tourism sector’s priorities in the city’s rebuild.

This is the third year that MBIE has contributed to this funding partnership ($625,000 in 2011/12 and $500,000 in 2012/13).
