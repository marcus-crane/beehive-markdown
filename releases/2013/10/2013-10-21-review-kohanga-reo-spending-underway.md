Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Hon Dr Pita Sharples confirmed today that the Independent Review of Public Funding to Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust Board is underway.

“A lot of work has been completed to establish this independent review, with Ernst & Young commissioned to carry it out. I am pleased that this has moved forward with urgency,” says Ms Parata.

“I wish to acknowledge that Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust Board (the Trust) is cooperating fully with the Independent Review.”

The objectives of the review are:

1. describe and assess the financial control environment to account for the receipt and use of public funds
2. to identify instances where there are gaps in financial controls
3. determine the extent to which the key financial controls are operating as intended
4. to make recommendations on any improvements in financial controls that are required to provide a high level of assurance to the Board and the Crown
5. report back on the implementation of any remedial actions the Board takes to address the findings of this review
6. establish what if any public funding provided to Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust may have been provided to Te Pātaka Ohanga.

The review will cover the controls in place over the funding provided by the Ministry of Education and the Tertiary Education Commission. It is expected to be completed by mid-December.

“It is important that kōhanga reo parents and whānau do not consider this a review of them – it is not. I am concerned for the standing of the 470 kōhanga, with over 9,000 children, served by over 1,000 kaiako, and supported by whānau up and down the country. We must ensure that they are kept informed, and that damaging allegations are contained, and dealt with swiftly and appropriately, for the protection of those who are innocent,” says Ms Parata.

“The strengthening of te reo Māori, and the contribution that whānau and parents make to the development of their children/mokopuna is at risk of being lost in the discussion over expenditure by the Trust. Most kōhanga reo are working tirelessly to advance their children’s interests, and they do best when parents and whānau are actively involved. They shouldn’t be made to feel whakamā about the actions of a few,” says Dr Sharples.

The Minister of Education has also placed on hold the work to address the issues arising from the urgent Treaty of Waitangi claim by the Trust (Wai 2336) while the review of public funding is progressed.

“This Government is serious about raising achievement for five out of five kids. We have set a very ambitious Better Public Service target for early childhood education targeting 98% of new entrant children having participated in early childhood education in 2016.

“I look forward to a thorough and satisfactory resolution to these matters so that we can move forward focussed on what matters – high quality education for our youngest New Zealanders,” says Ms Parata.
