Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has approved amendments to four regulatory plans to ensure some earthquake land repair processes no longer require resource consent.

The changes have been made using the special legislative powers of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 and apply immediately in order to help earthquake-related land repairs to progress more quickly.

They apply to the Christchurch City Plan, the Natural Resources Regional Plan, the proposed Land and Water Regional Plan and the Waimakariri River Regional Plan, affecting flat land properties across greater Christchurch.

Mr Brownlee says using the CER Act reduces costs and delays for property owners and will help the Christchurch City Council and Environment Canterbury streamline their consenting processes.

“This is in relation to small scale repair work covering a range of activities that includes repairs to undulating land, localised ponding, land cracking, and lateral spreading,” Mr Brownlee says.

“However standards must still be met to manage any environmental effects of undertaking the repairs.

“Changing the thresholds and standards will mean many property owners will be able to get on with their repairs without resource consent and that will help people to move on as quickly as possible.”

Land repair works on properties in the Port Hills and Banks Peninsula are not covered by these amendments. The Christchurch City Council website outlines the details for property owners covered by today’s announcement at [www.ccc.govt.nz/landrepair](http://www.ccc.govt.nz/landrepair)
