Justice Minister Judith Collins leaves tomorrow for China and Singapore to meet with her ministerial counterparts, officials and practitioners in public and private law.

Ms Collins will meet Chinese Minister of Justice Ms Wu Aiying in Beijing and discuss reforms to New Zealand’s court system and criminal procedure.

The Ministers will discuss the established Asia Pacific Regional Office of the Hague Conference. Based in Hong Kong, the Office was established late last year to attract more countries in the area to become members of the Conference.

Ms Collins will also visit Shanghai to address the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong. One of the Academy’s aims is to help local and international leaders develop a global perspective.

“New Zealand consistently ranks as one of the least corrupt countries in the world,” Ms Collins says.

“I look forward to speaking to the Academy about our experience in building an accountable, transparent government and how these features benefit our governance system and economy.”

In Singapore Ms Collins will meet Minister for Law, K Shanmugam and Singapore’s Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon to discuss New Zealand’s family court reforms, the use of alternative dispute resolution and to see first-hand how its electronic court system works.

“Like New Zealand, Singapore emphasises alternative dispute resolution and it will be a good chance to compare notes on the issue,” Ms Collins says.

“I’m also interested to see what aspects of Singapore’s system could be implemented in New Zealand as part of our court modernisation initiatives.”

While in Singapore Ms Collins will also meet with practitioners in public and private law, as well as visit the Maxwell Chambers international arbitration centre which includes several New Zealanders among its members.
