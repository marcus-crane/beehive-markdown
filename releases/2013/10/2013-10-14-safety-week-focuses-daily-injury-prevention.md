ACC Minister Judith Collins is welcoming the start of ACC’s Safety Week today to help raise awareness of safety risks and promote safer practices.

Ms Collins says this year’s Safety Week forms part of a wider rejuvenation of ACC’s injury prevention strategy.

“I’ve encouraged the corporation to put a greater, more evidence based focus on injury prevention because I know it has the capability to be more than just an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff,” Ms Collins says.

“This year we are reminding New Zealanders that they don’t have to be out on the rugby field or skateboarding to be at risk of an injury.

“While sport and recreation claim numbers are an on-going area of focus, a significant number of accidents happen during routine and seemingly harmless activities.

“Trips and falls are the biggest cause of injuries so it’s worth taking everyday precautions around stairs, dog leads, electrical leads, rugs and skipping ropes to make a difference. 

“This week is a good opportunity for New Zealanders to start thinking about safety in their daily routines. I’ve kicked off Safety Week by trying ACC’s new personal injury forecast tool and I encourage everyone to have a go.”
