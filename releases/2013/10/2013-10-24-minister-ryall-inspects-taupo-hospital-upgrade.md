Health Minister Tony Ryall inspected the progress being made on the $13 million Taupō Hospital redevelopment today.

“Stage one of the project, which saw the emergency department (ED), maternity unit and radiology department upgraded and earthquake strengthened was completed last month,” says Mr Ryall.

“The ED has doubled in size from six to 12 cubicles. The maternity unit has now moved into the main hospital building and has two birthing rooms and three post natal rooms. And the radiology department has been upgraded.

“Work on the next stage of the redevelopment has started. The old ED space is being refurbished and will be the new outpatient clinic area.

“The old maternity unit will also be refurbished as the third and final stage of the project in the new year. The community mental health service, which is currently based offsite, will relocate to the hospital.

“The previous layout of the hospital meant patients, doctors and nurses had to do a lot of walking to get from one service to another. The maternity unit, for example, was in a separate stand-alone building from the main hospital. 

“This redevelopment will make it much easier for people to get around. Health professionals will be able to do their jobs more efficiently and spend more time caring for patients, instead of walking the corridors.

“This government is committed to growing and protecting public health services. Over the past five years, we have invested over $770 million into capital projects for district health boards,” says Mr Ryall.
