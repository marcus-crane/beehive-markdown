Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain today welcomed the introduction of China Southern Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner to New Zealand.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner will replace the A330 currently used on the daily service between Guangzhou and Auckland.

“New Zealand has had a thriving relationship with China Southern Airlines since they entered the New Zealand market in April 2011. Today’s arrival of the Dreamliner is a testament to their continued commitment to New Zealand,” says Mr Tremain.

“China is now New Zealand’s second largest tourism market and forecasts show that arrivals from China are expected to more than double over the next 5 years to 450,000.

“The decision by China Southern Airlines to introduce the first scheduled services of the 787 Dreamliner to New Zealand will help meet that growing visitor demand by increasing their seat capacity. Along with the extra flights that were recently announced during the peak summer season, these changes will enable an extra 18,000 Chinese visitors to travel to New Zealand.

“This passenger growth has positive benefits for New Zealand. In the last 12 months to September 2013, there were over 236,000 Chinese visitors to New Zealand, contributing $645m to our economy.

“New Zealanders are also increasingly interested in exploring China. Recent Chinese visa changes championed by China Southern now allow New Zealanders to stay in Guangzhou up to 72 hours without an entry visa to China. This provides an attractive travel opportunity I’m sure many kiwis will take advantage of.”
