Local Government Minister Chris Tremain today congratulated the successful candidates in the 2013 local authority elections.

“There are lots of changes taking place in local government and it’s an exciting time to be involved in decision making,” says Mr Tremain.

“In councils where Mayors and councillors have been re-elected congratulations. Your community clearly values your leadership and it is a chance to continue with existing plans.

“In councils where there has been a change of leadership it’s a fresh start and an opportunity for renewed vigour and vision. I look forward to meeting newly elected Mayors as well as incumbents at the Mayors Forum being held on Thursday in Wellington.

“I would like to thank those New Zealanders who made an effort to vote and have a say in the shape of their community. I encourage people to engage with their local representatives to make sure their voice is heard.

“I also want to congratulate the many people in the media who have worked hard to promote stories about the local elections. Local councils work best when their proposals, plans and decisions are well known by the people they represent. The news media have a critically important role in supporting this aspect of our democracy.”
