Justice Minister Judith Collins will attend a meeting of the Standing Council of Law and Justice (SCLJ) with her Australian counterparts in Sydney this week.

SCLJ is an Australian Ministerial Council comprising of the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, its states and territories, and New Zealand's Minister of Justice. Norfolk Island has observer status at SCLJ meetings.

Ms Collins says SCLJ provides a forum for Ministers to discuss and progress matters of mutual interest and focuses on initiatives that require co-operation between jurisdictions.

“I’m looking forward to meeting with my Australian counterparts and having the opportunity to discuss topics concerning law and justice that benefit both sides of the Tasman,” Ms Collins says.

“During the meeting we will address a number of justice issues, including cybercrime, organised crime and restorative justice.

"I will also discuss the progress being made by NZ Police to develop a joint Memorandum of Understanding to improve the management of New Zealanders who are convicted in Australia and deported back to New Zealand, and this Government's plans to publish District Court judgments online."

Ms Collins will also have bilateral talks with the Australian Attorney-General Hon George Brandis QC and Minister of Justice, Hon Michael Keenan.
