The Associate Minister for Social Development, Tariana Turia today announced the establishment of an Expert Advisory Group on Family Violence in New Zealand.

“The Expert Advisory Group on Family Violence is being formed to provide independent strategic advice to assist Government to determine key priority actions to address family violence in New Zealand,” says Minister Turia.

“The Group has a range of expertise and experience in this field and will work towards solutions by the end of 2013. The members have been chosen not only for their expertise, but also for their commitment to action.  As a result their advice is expected to be able to be translated into change on the ground that is tangible and measureable.”

“A whole-of-government approach to family violence is vital and means we need to identify where there may be duplication of services or gaps in addressing family violence and ensure there are linkages with other strategic priorities.”

“Independent advice is an important component in achieving an effective, well-integrated family violence system which delivers accessible, high quality services for all New Zealanders who are affected by family violence.”

“The support of a range of services working hand in hand is what truly turns lives around. The Expert Advisory Group will help us ensure that irrespective of where violence occurs throughout the country, all those affected should be able to seek the appropriate social services, for example stopping violence programmes alongside alcohol and other drug treatment services.”
