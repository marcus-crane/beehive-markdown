Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Jo Goodhew today acknowledged 25 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellows at a special awards ceremony held at Government House.

“Today’s event is a celebration of the achievements of the Fellows who have completed their travel and research reports in the last two years,” said Mrs Goodhew.

The ceremony was hosted by the Patron of the Trust, His Excellency, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae, Governor-General of New Zealand.

“The work of the Fellows greatly enriches our communities as they identify and research new concepts overseas and bring their findings back to New Zealand.

“These Fellows return home inspired and with new networks and information that means their contribution continues well after they have returned.

“Fellows become part of a community, a national network, where they can share their new knowledge, perspectives and innovations.

“This occasion also provides an opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Board,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Some specific achievements that will greatly benefit the community and voluntary sector in New Zealand include:

Belinda De Mayo’s research into the development and delivery of ‘Creative Partnerships’, a programme targeting the most deprived communities in England and the United States of America.

Kaye Vessey’s research into the HomeShare programme in the United Kingdom, a volunteer programme which involves trained hosts opening their homes to older people for one day a week.

Research by Mason Tolerton and Rodney Bell on ways to further the aspirations of young New Zealanders.

Denise Bijoux’s research on community-led urban development projects to incorporate community voices into local development work.

**Background**

The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust was set up in 1965 to honour Sir Winston Churchill’s belief that world peace and greater international understanding could be promoted through ordinary people travelling to other countries and experiencing other cultures.

It has enabled New Zealanders wanting to investigate topics that will help them to increase their contribution to the community and their profession, business or calling to travel overseas to do their research.

Since the Trust was established in 1965 more than 800 Fellowships have been awarded. These Fellowships have enabled recipients to widen their experience, grow in confidence and increase their knowledge.
