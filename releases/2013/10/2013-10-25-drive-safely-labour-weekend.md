Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is reminding drivers to take care on the roads this long weekend.

“Our roads are traditionally busier over holiday weekends so it is important to take extra care on the road to ensure everyone arrives at their intended destination safely,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“The zero road toll for Queen’s Birthday Weekend this year shows that it is possible to have a holiday weekend without anyone losing their life on the roads, and I hope we can see that again this weekend.

“Any crash resulting in death or serious injury is unacceptable. Last Labour Weekend there were three fatal crashes and 81 reported injury crashes. These crashes resulted in six deaths and 22 serious injuries.”

“The messages are consistent – stay focussed, drive to the conditions, make sure that you are well-rested and don’t drink and drive.”

Police will again be focusing on reducing mean speeds, so anyone travelling more than 4km/h over the permanent posted speed limit may be ticketed. Police will also be breath testing drivers and checking that everyone in the vehicle is properly restrained.

The 2013 provisional national year-to-date road toll is still tracking to be one of the lowest in modern times. The 2013 year-to-date road toll currently sits at 203, compared to 235 in 2012.

“While any reduction in the road toll is encouraging, over 200 people have died on the road already this year, and thousands more injured. By all taking responsibility for improving road safety in New Zealand we can continue to reduce the number of New Zealanders being killed or injured on our roads.”

Labour weekend 2013 officially starts at 4pm on Friday 25 October and ends at 6am on Tuesday 29 October.
