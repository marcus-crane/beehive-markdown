Revenue Minister Todd McClay has welcomed the start of the formal Expression of Interest process of Inland Revenue’s Transformation programme.

“This is the next step in transforming Inland Revenue into a more user-friendly agency that will allow New Zealanders to simply and efficiently manage their interactions through online services,” says Mr McClay.

The expression of interest process is intended to procure service providers who will help Inland Revenue design the first stage of the Transformation Programme and also provide high level validation of future stages.

“The transformation is part of an all-of-Government approach to delivering a customer-focussed service through Better Public Services. Inland Revenue is working hard to ensure these changes will deliver real benefits to New Zealanders.”

“Transformation is going to take time, and throughout the process there will be opportunities for different New Zealand service providers with the right skills and experiences to help us build and deliver this transformation programme, “says Mr McClay
