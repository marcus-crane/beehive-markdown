A Bill that will continue a temporary ban on the parallel importation of films for commercial use passed its third reading in Parliament today.

Commerce Minister Craig Foss says The Copyright (Parallel Importing of Films) Amendment Bill will reduce the current ban period of nine months to five months from a film’s international release.

“The current commercial ban prevents importing films for commercial use for nine months after their international cinema release is due to expire at the end of next month,” says Mr Foss.

A new five month ban period will come into force from 31 October. The ban does not prevent a person from importing a film for personal use.

“The original ban came into force in 2003 to support our local cinema industry by allowing them enough time to distribute and exhibit films before they were available in stores.

“The ban will automatically lapse in three years. This will allow provincial cinemas in particular time to finish converting to digital exhibition technology and develop their film distribution model to reflect changes in the market for films, particularly online.

“The shortened ban period reflects the fact that the distribution of films is now markedly different. The gaps between international and New Zealand film release dates have reduced and digital technologies mean cinemas can obtain and show films more quickly,” says Mr Foss.
