Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says on average 60,000 people a week are now using Customs’ automated passenger processing system.

SmartGate was introduced in 2009 and since its roll out in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch has been used by 6.7 million arriving and departing passengers.

“The original targets had SmartGate use reaching more than 60,000 users a week in 2015, so I’m delighted it has shattered all expectations. As more New Zealanders and Australians shift to ePassports we will see a further increase in usage.

“This technology has delivered on the Government’s vision for an improved trans-Tasman traveller experience, and this experience continues to be extended to other travellers too,” Mr Williamson says.

In 2012, the eligible age to use SmartGate was reduced from 18 years old to 16. More recently it has been extended to US and UK ePassport holders on departure.

Customs will continue to look for further opportunities to enable more travellers to use SmartGate, including opening it to other nationalities and further reducing the age eligibility.

“The next milestone will be seven million passengers having used the technology, and I’m told this will be reached by the end of the year, Mr Williamson says.

SmartGate uses the information in ePassports and facial recognition technology to perform customs and immigration checks. The technology improves border security by allowing Customs to focus on high-risk travellers.
