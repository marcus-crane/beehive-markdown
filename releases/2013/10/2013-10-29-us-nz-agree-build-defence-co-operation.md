Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman and US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel have agreed to extend co-operation on peacekeeping initiatives. 

“Our defence relationship with the US is in great shape, and provides a strong platform for working closely together in the future,” says Dr Coleman.

“We have agreed to expand our co-operation on peacekeeping training initiatives. We will be looking for opportunities to support our Asia-Pacific partners to build the capacity of their peacekeeping forces.

“New Zealand will also be providing military instructors to the US-led Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative from 2014.”

Secretary Hagel and Dr Coleman welcomed the increased co-operation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the Asia-Pacific. They also noted last month’s successful meeting of Pacific Army Chiefs. Co-chaired by New Zealand and the US, the conference focused on how the Pacific Armies and United Nations can improve co-operation on peacekeeping missions.

New Zealand and the US have achieved a number of significant milestones since the signing of the Washington Declaration last year, which set out regular high level dialogue and enhanced co-operation in the region.

“Our opportunities for defence engagement, joint training and exercising continue to increase and we expect the tempo to continue,” says Dr Coleman.

“The NZDF is looking forward to working with our international partners, including the US, as part of Exercise Southern Katipo next month, the largest ever international exercise to be held in New Zealand.

“Next year, the NZDF will also support counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden as part of the US led Combined Maritime Force, and will take part in Exercise RIMPAC in the US, the world’s largest maritime exercise.”

Dr Coleman welcomed Secretary Hagel’s confirmation that he had authorised the New Zealand Navy to dock at the US naval port at Pearl Harbor during Exercise RIMPAC 2014.
