The steps being taken to make sure our growing ageing population remains healthy and independent were today outlined by the Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew launched the Older New Zealanders: Healthy, Independent, Connected and Respected document to coincide with the International Day of Older Persons.

“This document outlines the services and support available to older people, and summarises in one place what is going on across government agencies to reaffirm this Government’s commitment to the Positive Ageing Strategy.

“It also looks at the opportunities our growing older population will bring, and how to recognise the skills and knowledge of older New Zealanders.

“This document contains information to help all sectors utilise the growing collective wisdom.”

Mrs Goodhew said the document highlighted the need for a continued focus on older New Zealanders who are vulnerable.

“They can be vulnerable for a range of reasons – they may be socially isolated, struggling financially, or even victims of abuse. Our current cross-agency approach helps us focus on those older people who need it most.”

Also released today was the Business of Ageing: 2013 Update, which contains updated projections on the economic contribution of older people over the next four decades.
