A new Housing New Zealand initiative called FirstHome to help families buy their own home was announced today in Blenheim by Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith.

“FirstHome will help modest income earners in provincial New Zealand buy their first home by gifting them a 10 per cent deposit and giving them priority to purchase surplus vacant state houses no longer needed by Housing New Zealand,” Dr Smith says.

“FirstHome will improve housing outcomes at both ends of the affordability spectrum. It will help modest income families in provincial New Zealand buy their first home. It will also free up capital from these surplus vacant properties to invest in new state houses in high demand areas like Auckland and Christchurch.

“There is nothing new in selling surplus vacant state houses, with 1280 being sold during the last Government. The new policy is giving modest income first home buyers preference and gifting them a 10 per cent deposit rather than selling the properties on the open market.”

Dr Smith made the announcement at a three-bedroom FirstHome property in Blenheim which will be placed on the market on 7 October for $160,000.

FirstHome eligibility criteria is that applicants’ must be first home buyers, have an income equal to, or less than, the national household average (one person $53,000, two or more persons $80,600) and be committed to owning and living in the house for a minimum of three years. Housing New Zealand will make a grant of 10 per cent of the property’s market value, up to a maximum of $20,000. Buyers may also be eligible for other home ownership assistance such as the KiwiSaver first-home deposit subsidy and savings withdrawal, and a Welcome Home Loan.

“Housing New Zealand advises that with the high holding costs of these properties with council rates, vandalism and upkeep, the cost of the FirstHome grants will largely be offset. The revenue from the sales will be used to help fund the $2.9 billion record investment in Housing New Zealand’s state housing stock to ensure homes are in the right place, are of the right size and are of good quality,” Dr Smith says.

“The first 41 of these homes will be ready for sale on 7 October and consist of properties from Otorohanga to Invercargill. They have an average market valuation of $120,000. 100 properties will be available in the first year, with about 400 available for sale over the next three years.

“The properties available for FirstHome are those that are vacant and unlikely to be required for eligible state house tenants because of their size and location.”

This new initiative is a small part of the Government’s broader programme of measures to help families get into their first home. Action is being taken on freeing up land supply, reforming the Resource Management Act, reigning in council development charges, scrutinising building material costs, reducing compliance costs, and improving productivity in the construction sector. The Government has also made changes that will double the number of people eligible for a KiwiSaver first-home deposit subsidy and treble the number of people receiving a Welcome Home Loan, effective from today.

“My first home was an ex-state house. They are solid, well-built and many are well suited for renovation and home improvement. I welcome being able to help hundreds of other New Zealanders get onto the first rung of the property ladder,” Dr Smith says.
