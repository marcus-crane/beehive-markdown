Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the launch of Radio New Zealand’s new online youth service – “The Wireless”

The project is aimed at providing an online forum for content relevant to 18-30 year olds, while promoting emerging New Zealand talent.

“I would like to congratulate Radio New Zealand for continuing to expand its online presence. The way we receive our content is changing as traditional broadcast methods are challenged.

**“**Radio New Zealand is already a leader in the online space. Increasing numbers of listeners both here and abroad are accessing time-shifted content through Radio New Zealand’s critically acclaimed smartphone application.

“I’m pleased to see Radio New Zealand’s continued commitment to look beyond traditional broadcast models to communicate with New Zealanders, both on air and online,” says Mr Foss.
