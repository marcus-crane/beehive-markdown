The Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Mike O’Donnell as a member of the New Zealand Tourism Board.

Mr O’Donnell is the Chief Operating Officer for Trade Me, New Zealand’s largest online business; a business columnist; and Chairman of Positively Wellington Tourism.

Mr O’Donnell is resigning his Chairmanship to take up his position on the New Zealand Tourism Board.

“The skills, personal attributes and experience that Mr O’Donnell brings to the table will be of great value to the New Zealand Tourism Board,” says Mr Key.

Mr O’Donnell has been appointed for a three-year term and replaces Malcolm Johns, who is departing the Board in October 2013, following completion of his second term.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Johns for his commitment and service over his two terms with the Board,” says Mr Key.

The New Zealand Tourism Board (known as Tourism New Zealand) is a Crown entity, responsible for ensuring that New Zealand is effectively marketed as a visitor destination in order to maximise long-term benefits to New Zealand.
