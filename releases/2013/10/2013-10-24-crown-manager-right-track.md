Local Government Minister Chris Tremain says Crown Manager Doug Martin is steering Christchurch’s building consent processes in the right direction.

“I met with Doug Martin today and have been very impressed with the progress being made.  A programme of work is well underway to ensure the Council can regain accreditation as a Building Consent  Authority,” says Mr Tremain.

“Restructuring of the council’s consent process should be in place by Christmas.  The proposed changes have been well received by staff in the building controls unit.  I was very pleased to see the professionalism and good will that exists between the Crown Manager and staff.  A positive relationship is important for Christchurch City Council in achieving a successful outcome.

“Major challenges lie ahead, with a sharp rise in consents forecast from now until late 2015.  However Mr Martin has made it a priority to manage this demand effectively and deliver better service to customers, including faster turnaround times.

“In addition 19 Building Consent Authorities have registered their interest in assisting the Council with its building consenting function.  It is anticipated that 150-200 consents per week will be contracted out.

“I have also met with Mayor-elect Lianne Dalziel, who says the newly elected council are incredibly positive about the way the Crown Manager Appointment is working and are confident that Christchurch City Council are on the pathway back to accreditation.

“I would like to thank Mr Martin and the consents staff for the hard work they have put in to ensure the council is on the right path to meeting the needs of its ratepayers.

“One of the Governments priorities is rebuilding Christchurch so Canterbury families can get their lives back on track.”
