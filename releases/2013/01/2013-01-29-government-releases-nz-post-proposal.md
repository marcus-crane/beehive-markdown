Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today released a proposal from New Zealand Post seeking to allow greater flexibility in the postal services it provides.

"During the last 10 years mail volumes have dropped considerably, with 265 million fewer items being posted each year compared to 2002. Within five years, mail volumes are forecast to be nearly half what they were in 2002," Ms Adams says.

"In light of those significant reductions in mail volume, New Zealand Post is seeking to make changes to the Universal Service Obligations it is bound by.

“New Zealand Post has advised me that it considers changes are needed to ensure a sustainable postal service in the 21st century.

“Any change would require Government approval, and before deciding what, if any, changes to make, I want to give the public the opportunity to comment on the proposals.

“In deciding whether to accept or reject the proposal or seek to negotiate a compromise, I will look to balance the interests of postal users with the need to ensure a financially-viable postal service.”

New Zealand Post’s proposed changes include having the flexibility to reduce the number of days mail is delivered to a minimum of three days a week and introducing more self-service kiosks.

Minimum service requirements for New Zealand Post are set out in the Deed of Understanding it signed with the Crown in 1998. The Deed has not been significantly reviewed since it was signed.
