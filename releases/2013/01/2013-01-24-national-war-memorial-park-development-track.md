Realisation of a commemorative park alongside the National War Memorial in Wellington is a step closer with the opening of a new road diversion tomorrow to free up Buckle Street for the construction of a new underpass.

The National War Memorial Park will be developed in time for Anzac Day 2015.

Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says diverting traffic off the main Buckle Street alignment will allow crews to begin work excavating the underpass.  The underpass is scheduled to be completed in late 2014.

“The NZ Transport Agency, on behalf of the Memorial Park Alliance, has worked swiftly and sensitively to build the diversion on time and with minimal disruption, which bodes well for the construction of the underpass and park,” Mr Brownlee says.  

“The temporary diversion has been built to state highway standard to ensure a high quality road to cater for 25,000 motorists every day over the next two years.

“It also allows safe and easy passage for pedestrians and cyclists, including the provision of a new signalled pedestrian crossing.

“Getting traffic onto the new diversion is a very encouraging milestone.

“It means Buckle Street is freed up, we can bring the diggers in and get to work building the underpass and then creating the park.

“The National War Memorial Park is a fitting commemorative space that pays respectful tribute to those who have served and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country,” Mr Brownlee says
