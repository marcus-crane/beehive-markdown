Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges says the record low holiday road toll is encouraging but efforts need to continue to improve road safety.

Six people died on the roads during the official holiday period which ran from 4pm on 24 December to 6am this morning.

During the Christmas and New Year period last year 19 people were killed, 65 seriously injured and 335 received minor injuries. Injury statistics for the 2012/13 holiday period will take several months to finalise.

The lowest road toll recorded previously was 8 in 1959/60.

"This year's holiday toll shows that drivers have been taking responsibility, and focusing when behind the wheel,” Mr Bridges said.

“However every fatality and serious injury on the road is a tragedy for the families and loved ones of those involved. It is important we continue to work hard in 2013 to ensure even fewer suffer the consequences of road death or injury.”
