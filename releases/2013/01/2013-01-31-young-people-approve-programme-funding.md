Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is delighted young people have given the go-ahead for 49 youth programmes around the country.

“I decided young people themselves should consider applications for programmes aimed at their peers and recommend which should receive funding.”

“The panels of young people have made really good decisions to support initiatives to develop leadership skills and community engagement.”

Grants of $2,000 to $7,000 have been awarded to 49 organisations around New Zealand from the contestable Youth Fund which totals $200,000.

“I’m really proud of our young people for stepping up in their local areas to sit on these panels and make decisions that will benefit their community.”

“It’s also young people who deliver the programmes, so this is really driven by the next generation of New Zealanders,” says Mrs Bennett.

Applications were open to individuals or groups of young people aged 12 to 24 who have the support of a legal entity, like a school or youth organisation.

The legal entity holds the funds and works in partnership with the young people to deliver the programme.

Programmes include courses for disabled youth to increase confidence and transition out of high school, a project to trace whakapapa, performing arts, sports and leadership projects as well as music and cultural programmes.
