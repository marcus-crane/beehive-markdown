Cabinet has been updated on Mr Bain’s application for compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment at its meeting today, says Justice Minister Judith Collins.

“I have updated my colleagues on the status of Mr Bain’s application. Cabinet has not made any decision on the next steps for the application.

“As Mr Bain’s application falls outside the Cabinet guidelines, Mr Bain has no entitlement to compensation. Any decision regarding compensation is entirely at Cabinet’s discretion,” Ms Collins said.

When a decision on next steps is made, there will be a further announcement regarding the process and timeframe for consideration of the application.
