Trade and Climate Change Issues Minister Tim Groser will depart for Europe today to attend international trade and climate change meetings.

The focus of Mr Groser’s visit will be the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland from 23-27 January, along with meetings in Geneva.

“The Forum gives New Zealand a valuable opportunity to engage with the world’s top decision-makers on how to get the global economy back on a path of stable growth and higher employment,” Mr Groser says, “as well as a chance to discuss the implications for New Zealand.”

In Davos, Mr Groser will also attend an informal meeting of Trade Ministers to discuss the outlook for the multilateral trading system and preparations for the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference at the end of this year.

“It is critical that leaders continue to explore ways to keep markets open and to achieve further trade liberalisation. Stimulating trade through liberalisation and regional integration provides an important engine not only for global economic recovery but also for economic growth, poverty reduction, and development,” Mr Groser says.

In addition to the formal meetings, Mr Groser will meet with counterparts to discuss progress on New Zealand’s trade agenda and his candidature for WTO Director-General.

Mr Groser will speak at the OECD Policy Dialogue on Aid for Trade in Paris, and attend the launch of the OECD-WTO Trade in Value–Added Database from 16-17 January.

He will then attend the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture in Berlin, which will focus the future of the global agri-food industry.
