Bay of Plenty MP and Health Minister Tony Ryall has expressed his sympathy to the family of Brian and Grace Johnston who were killed in a bus accident in Kenya this week.

“Grace and Brian were active and well liked members of the Bay of Plenty community and they will be sorely missed.

“I pay tribute to Brian Johnston’s long and dedicated service to Bay of Plenty health services - yesterday would have been his 26th anniversary at Bay of Plenty District Health Board.

“Brian was well liked and widely respected and he made a significant contribution at both Tauranga and Whakatane hospitals. His passing is a great loss.”

Mr Ryall also extends his sympathy to the family of Caitlin Dickson who lost her life in the Kenyan bus crash.
