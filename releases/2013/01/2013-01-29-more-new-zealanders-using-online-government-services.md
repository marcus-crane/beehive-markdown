More New Zealanders are choosing to interact with government agencies online says Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain.

Figures released today show 32.4 per cent of New Zealanders used secure online government services during the July to September quarter, up from 29.9 per cent when measurements started in June.

“The standout performance has been the launch of online passport renewals.  Within a few months 40 per cent of adult passport renewals  are now being done online.  When passport figures are included in the aggregate Result 10 figures we will see an even better result than those released today,” says Mr Tremain.

“The Government is committed to making it easier, more convenient and more secure for the public to complete their most common transactions online.

“Our goal is for 70 per cent of New Zealanders’ most common transactions with government to be done digitally by 2017.”

In March 2012, the Government set out its key results plan to provide better public services.  Result 10 is focused on enabling New Zealanders to complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment.
