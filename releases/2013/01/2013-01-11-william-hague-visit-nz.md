United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague will visit New Zealand next week, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“I look forward to welcoming Mr Hague to New Zealand for the second time in two years,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully and Mr Hague will hold formal bilateral talks in Auckland on January 15.

“This is an excellent opportunity to address critical foreign policy issues with a close and valued partner, and explore new ways to work together on bilateral and global issues,” Mr McCully says.

“I expect the situation in Iran and Syria, the Middle East Peace Process and developments in Afghanistan will feature in our discussions, as will regional issues such as Fiji and Myanmar.”

While in Auckland, Mr Hague will meet New Zealand business leaders and entrepreneurs, young Pacific leaders, academics, and NGOs.

Mr Hague will also visit Christchurch for a tour of the Red Zone and to lay a wreath at HMNZS Pegasus naval base in honour of New Zealand service men and women.
