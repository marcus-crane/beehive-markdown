“Six weeks over summer to think about new policy, and Labour comes up with precisely nothing,” Deputy Prime Minister Bill English says.

“The Labour leader’s speech today was full off last year’s slogans and no new policy.

“He says that he wants to be hands-on, and yet opposes every hands-on move National is making to encourage investment and growth. On top of that, Labour still hasn’t apologised for their wasteful policies the last time they got their hands on the economy.

“And to make it worse, at the same time their coalition partners the Greens are up in Auckland busy working out how to stop everything they don’t like – which includes everything to do with growth and jobs.

“A very poor effort to start the year from the opposition,” Mr English says.
