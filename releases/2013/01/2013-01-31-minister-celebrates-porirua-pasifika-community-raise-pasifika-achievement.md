The Government’s Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017 has been received by the Porirua Pasifika community as the Government continues its focus on raising achievement for five-out-of-five kids. 

Education and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata says the Planaims to have Pasifika kids participating, engaging, achieving and succeeding in education.

“We know that education is a passport to a better life. That’s why the Government is focused on raising achievement for all our kids.” says Ms Parata.

“One of the Government’s priorities this term is delivering better public services, and the Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017 is an important part of achieving our targets in education.”

Ms Parata joined families, community leaders and local educators at the *Ekalesia Faapotopotoga Kerisiano Samoa* (EFKS) church hall in Waitangirua, where community consultation for the development of the Plantook placelast year*.*

Pasifika children and young people who are succeeding in education were at the centre of the event. 

“We owe it to our kids to work together, and work harder, to lift their achievement. So I thank the Porirua community for its contribution to the Pasifika Education Plan. Now we have a shared plan to drive us all towards getting better results.

“Pasifika people can make a major contribution to our economy. Education is the key to realising this potential. Government, the sector and communities are responsible for ensuring this happens,” says Ms Parata.

The Ministry of Education, Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Careers New Zealand, Education Review Office, New Zealand Qualifications Authority, New Zealand Teachers Council, New Zealand School Trustee Association and the Tertiary Education Commission worked closely to develop the Pasifika Education Plan.

The Plan adopts a Pasifika ‘connected' way of working with the community and educational agencies to raise achievement among Pasifika children and young people.

The Ministry of Education is set to release an implementation plan to support ECE services, schools and tertiary providers reach the goals set out in the Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017. 

The Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017was launched in Auckland late last year.There will be future events in Wellington and Christchurch.
