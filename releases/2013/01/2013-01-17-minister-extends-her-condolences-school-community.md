Education Minister, Hekia Parata, has extended her condolences to Chair Greg Hollister-Jones and Principal Eoin Crosbie of Bethlehem College over the deaths of participants in their mission partnership programme in Kenya.

Brian and Grace Johnston and Caitlin Dickson died in a minivan accident while travelling to the small village of Mahanga.

“I have conveyed my condolences to Greg and Eoin this morning, extending to the school community and families during this time,” says Ms Parata.

“These are wonderful people who were passionate about their work in providing care to a community that really needed their help. My deepest sympathy goes out to these special families grieving at this time. Ngā mihi nui.”
