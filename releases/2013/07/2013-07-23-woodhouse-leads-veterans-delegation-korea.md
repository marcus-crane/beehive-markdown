Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse departs today to lead an official delegation of 30 veterans to the Republic of Korea to attend the 60th anniversary commemorations of the Korean War Armistice.

Mr Woodhouse said he was honoured to lead the official delegation to Korea for the anniversary.

“It is a privilege to travel to the Republic of Korea with these brave veterans, and hear many stories of their time there during the Korean War,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“New Zealand played an important part in the Korean War, and suffered significant losses. We committed more than 6000 personnel, and lost 45 men, with another 79 wounded.

“I’m sure it will be a moving ceremony for the veterans as they stand and remember their lost comrades, and have their service recognised.

“We also remember the Korean people who died, and those who faced rebuilding a country devastated by the effects of war,” said Mr Woodhouse.

During their time in Korea, the delegation will attend a ceremony held at Kapyong, the site of one of New Zealand’s most significant battles, a multi-country ceremony in Seoul for the 60th anniversary, and a ceremony on Sunday 28 July in Busan, which is where New Zealand Forces were based.
