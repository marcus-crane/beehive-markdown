Minister of Trade and for Climate Change Issues Tim Groser will depart tomorrow for Washington to meet his new US counterpart, United States Trade Representative, Mike Froman.

In Washington Mr Groser will also hold discussions with key stakeholders in the Trans-Pacific Partnership including Members of Congress and industry.

“Securing a high ambition outcome in the Trans-Pacific Partnership will provide a massive boost to the New Zealand economy well into the future, Mr Groser says. “This is about growth and jobs for New Zealanders. In Washington I will be promoting the New Zealand agenda in this critically important initiative.”

Mr Groser will then travel to Poland, where he will meet with his Trade and Climate Change counterparts in Warsaw before travelling on to Krakow to participate in a meeting of the Major Economies Forum (MEF).

The MEF comprises the seventeen biggest economies in the climate change negotiations. The forum aims to bridge differences among the major players through constructive and open dialogue.

“The MEF meeting will provide an opportunity to meet with the major players in the climate change negotiations in the lead up to the Warsaw climate change conference (COP19) in November,” Mr Groser says.
