Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says the battle to preserve New Zealand’s natural heritage has taken a step forward, with 150 hectares of wilding trees cleared at the iconic Lake Pukaki.

Land Information New Zealand has completed an intensive 18 month eradication programme in an area between the western shoreline of the lake and State Highway 80.  It will enable the shoreline to return to its natural state.

“Wilding trees, including conifers such as lodgepole pine *(pinus contorta)*, pose a significant threat to the environment by competing with native flora and fauna for sunlight and water.

“The Government is committed to minimising the impact of these trees by clearing them from Crown land and contributing to community programmes in areas such as Mid Dome, Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu,” Mr Williamson says.

Due to the success of the wilding tree clearance programme on Lake Pukaki’s western shoreline, LINZ will look to undertake a similar programme to remove areas of wilding tree infestation along the eastern shoreline.

“This is a good example of a government agency acting as a responsible landowner and a good neighbour.  LINZ will continue to work with the local community, including adjacent landowners, to enhance the landscape and amenity values in this iconic area, and others,” Mr Williamson says.
