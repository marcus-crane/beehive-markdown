“Better prostate cancer awareness amongst men and their families will lead to better survival rates,” said Health Minister Tony Ryall, acknowledging the efforts of prostate cancer awareness campaigner Graham Frith.

The Minister caught up with the cyclist campaigner on Parliament’s forecourt today, along with National MP members of Parliament’s Health Committee; Dr Paul Hutchison, Scott Simpson, Jian Yang and Paul Foster-Bell.

Mr Frith, from Hanmer Springs, is embarking on a series of cycle tours of New Zealand - and then the world - to raise awareness of prostate cancer.

“Mr Frith says a couple of his mates had a bit of a scare, and even though he’s a volunteer ambulance officer, he didn’t know anything about prostate cancer,” Mr Ryall said.

“That’s why he is working in conjunction with the Prostate Cancer Foundation of New Zealand on his journey to spread information about prostate cancer to men and their families.

“About 3,000 New Zealand men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and more than 600 die from the disease.”

“The Government has put in an extra $4.3 million to raise awareness of prostate cancer among men and their families, and to ensure men have better access to quality information and care.

“We appreciate the extra input from people like Graham Frith and the Prostate Cancer Foundation and we wish him a safe journey,” Mr Ryall said.

The Government’s $4.3 million prostate cancer campaign funding will be used to:

- Develop information resources for men and their families.
- Create GP support material to help men and their doctors make informed decisions about prostate cancer tests and treatment.
- Develop clinical standards to make sure all men have fair and equal access to quality cancer care.

Prostate cancer is most common in men over 50 years of age.
