The ability for  Clinical Pharmacists who have completed the new postgraduate certificate in pharmacist prescribing and who are registered with the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand to prescribe certain medicines has been welcomed by Associate Health Minister Mr McClay.

Pharmacists in the UK have been prescribing since 2003, and the feedback from health professionals and patients has been positive. New Zealand is leading the way in Australasia, having implemented pharmacist prescribing before Australia.

“This move to allow pharmacist prescribing is consistent with the Government’s commitment to support health practitioners to work to their full capability and improve patient access to integrated health services,” says Associate Health Minister McClay.

"Prescribing is a natural extension of the experienced clinical pharmacist’s role, using their extensive training and knowledge.".

Pharmacists who have completed the appropriate training will be able to prescribe a range of medicines in a defined area of practise, agreed to with the collaborative health care team in which they work. This means they will work closely with the patient's doctor to tailor  and then better manage the combination of medicines to the patient's individual needs. Their role is to make sure the patient is on the best medicine in the right doses. Their work involves reviewing and making prescribing decisions to improve the patient's treatment.

Pharmacist Prescribers also play an educator role by providing the opportunity for patients to address queries regarding their medicines.  

The establishment of the new qualification followed a demonstration project funded by Health Workforce New Zealand (HWNZ) and run jointly by the Pharmacy Schools of the University of Auckland and University of Otago. The first group of fourteen pharmacists have completed the training.

“The Government is investing in ensuring patients have improved access to highly skilled and integrated health professionals in their communities. This is an important part of the New Zealand Medicines Strategy, *Medicines New Zealand,* arising out of United Future’s Confidence and supply Agreement with National the aim of which is to ensure quality use of pharmaceuticals in the health sector and enhance the role of Pharmacists in patient medicines management’, Mr McClay said.
