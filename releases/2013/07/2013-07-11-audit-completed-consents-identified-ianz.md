Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says an audit of potentially non-compliant consents identified during International Accreditation New Zealand’s building consent assessment of Christchurch City Council has been completed.

In September 2012, IANZ identified 17 consents where full compliance with the requirements of the Building Code or Act had not been demonstrated.

Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment officials have reviewed the consents in question.

“MBIE has found although there were processing failures, the consents are all technically sound and would not result in any safety issues. Many of the failures relate to incomplete or incorrect administrative processes.

“Officials are auditing a further sample of consents issued by the Council in the past six months to be sure consents haven’t been issued for unsound buildings. I expect the results in the coming days,” Mr Williamson says.

A wider audit will be conducted by Crown Manager Doug Martin, who was appointed after the Council lost its accreditation.
