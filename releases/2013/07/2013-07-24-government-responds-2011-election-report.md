Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the Government’s response to the Justice and Electoral Committee’s report on the 2011 General Election.

Ms Collins says she is pleased that there was a very high degree of consensus among Committee members on the report’s 32 recommendations.

“The Government will now work through the recommendations and where practicable, make changes before the 2014 General Election,” Ms Collins says.

One recommendation, to allow overseas voters to scan and upload their ballot papers to a secure elections server, has already been addressed by amending electoral regulations earlier this year.

The Government will also work with the Electoral Commission as appropriate to action another seven of the Committee’s recommendations that do not require law changes.

Ms Collins expects to introduce an electoral amendment bill into the House shortly to implement recommendations that will realistically be able to be put in place in time for the 2014 General Election.

“Proposed changes would focus on improving services to voters, candidates and parties, improving efficiency by allowing greater use of technology, and further enhancing the integrity of elections,” Ms Collins says.

The Government’s response to the Justice and Electoral Committee report is attached.
