Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith and Associate Housing Minister Tariana Turia today welcomed the blessing and naming ceremony for a family-style social housing unit for kaumatua in Flaxmere.

“The Kaumatua Whare has been designed to provide affordable rental accommodation for kaumatua on low incomes in response to a shortage of appropriate housing for kaumatua in Flaxmere,” Mrs Turia says.

“This is an innovative housing initiative that provides 10 en-suite bedrooms, with residents sharing a lounge, laundry, kitchen, entertainment, and outdoor living areas. A live-in housekeeper will provide two meals a day, with housework and chores done by residents and volunteers.

“This whare is aimed at those of our elders whose only income is NZ Superannuation and who may experience loneliness or cannot live alone. The whare will be a wonderful home where whanau can feel secure that their loved ones are being looked after.”

Dr Smith says New Zealand faces a huge challenge over the next three decades in how we house a growing elderly population.

“The private sector is making huge investments for the better off. We are going to need innovative solutions like this, in partnership with Government, for older New Zealanders on lower incomes.”

Dr Smith says the project, run through the Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga charitable trust, received a term loan of $468,267 and a grant of $495,407 in 2010/11 from the Housing Innovation Fund, which has now been superseded by the Social Housing Unit.

“This whare is a perfect example of the strength of community housing providers taking innovative responses to community housing needs by providing tailored wrap-around services for their clients,” he says.

“The Government wants to see more of this, which is why we set up the $139 million Social Housing Fund and will pass the Social Housing Reform Bill to give approved community housing providers’ access to subsidised income related rents for their clients.

“The Government’s aim is to have 20 per cent of social housing provided by community organisations in the long-term.”
