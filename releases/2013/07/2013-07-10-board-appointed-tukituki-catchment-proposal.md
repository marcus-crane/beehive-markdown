Environment Minister Amy Adams and Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith have today announced the members of an independent Board of Inquiry to consider the Tukituki Catchment Proposal.

The proposal was directed to a Board of Inquiry last month by Ms Adams and Dr Smith.

The proposal by Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company is made up of two components.

Hawke’s Bay Regional Council requested that both components should be referred to a Board of Inquiry for a decision.

The first component relates to the creation and operation of a dam structure, storage reservoir and canal system. The second component relates to the regional council’s Plan Change 6, which proposes new policies and rules intended to implement a nutrient management framework and water allocation regime in the area.

The proposal involves the Minister of Conservation because impacts of the scheme include the coastal marine areas for which he has responsibility.

The five members of the Board considering this application are retired High Court Judge Hon Lester Chisholm (Chairperson), Environment Commissioner Russell Howie and resource management experts Loretta Lovell, Alec Neill and Matthew Lawson.

The Board runs its own process and makes its decision independently of both the Environmental Protection Authority and the Ministers.
