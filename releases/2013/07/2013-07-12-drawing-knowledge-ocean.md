Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced that Land Information New Zealand will contribute $2.1 million this year to the Ocean Survey 20/20 initiative.

The cross agency initiative coordinated by LINZ was launched in 2006 to promote research in the New Zealand marine environment. 

“The LINZ contribution will pay for 40 sailing days on the RV Tangaroa, which is a vessel owned by NIWA. 

“Two voyages will undertake seafloor mapping of the southern Colville Ridge off the coast of Auckland, geological and biological sampling and mapping the seafloor in the Aotea and Reinga Basins off the North Island’s west coast.”

Another voyage will deploy ocean bottom seismometers and pressure recorders offshore from Gisborne to monitor earthquake tremor activity over a two year period.

Ocean Survey 20/20 aims to provide New Zealand with a better knowledge of its ocean territory, which is 23 times the size of its land area, to underpin the sustainable development of our ocean resources.
