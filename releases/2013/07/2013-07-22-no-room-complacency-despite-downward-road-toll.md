Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is cautiously welcoming half-yearly data showing a continuing downward trend in fatalities on New Zealand roads.

Provisional national road toll figures show that the 128 road fatalities for the six months to 30 June 2013 will be the lowest six month period in more than 50 years.

“The year to date toll shows a significant 40 per cent decrease compared to 2009, when the six month figure was 212. For the past three years we have maintained a lower number for this period, with 139 road fatalities in 2011 and 140 in 2012.”

The provisional number of fatalities for 15-24 year olds sits at 28, which is half the 57 figure from 2009, with this age group also declining as a proportion of the total road toll.

“The declining number of young people being killed on our roads is particularly heartening, and suggests that recent policies and efforts to target young drivers are making a difference,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“We have come a long way in the area of road safety in the last 40 years. This year’s figure contrasts sharply to the horrific road toll of 439 for the six months to the end of June in 1973, but we cannot afford to be complacent.

“Every fatality or serious injury on our roads is one too many and behind every road statistic are real families who are grieving for their loved ones.”

“At this mid-point of the year, and with more wintery conditions to come, it is important to take stock and remind ourselves to drive to the conditions, respect other road users and follow the road rules.

If we all keep safety at the forefront of our thoughts while driving, we could see 2013 end with an all-time low annual road toll. That’s a worthy goal for which we can all do our bit.
