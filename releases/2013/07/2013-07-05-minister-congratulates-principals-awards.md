Education Minister Hekia Parata says the two principals who have been awarded Sir Peter Blake Leadership Awards tonight are outstanding examples of what inspirational leadership in schools can do for raising achievement.

The Sir Peter Blake Leadership Awards recognise six emerging New Zealand leaders each year who show outstanding leadership and demonstrate the ability to build and lead successful teams. The Blake Medal is also awarded to an exceptional New Zealand leader at the annual Awards event.

Louise Anaru, Principal of Flaxmere College and Nicola Ngarewa, Principal of Tamatea High School, were nominated by the Ministry of Education which recognised their extraordinary contributions.

“Ms Anaru and Ms Ngarewa demonstrate every day their deep commitment and passion for making a difference in the lives of young learners,’’ says Ms Parata.

“Ms Anaru took over decile one Flaxmere College in 2010 and immediately set about building a strong leadership team that was heavily invested in making a difference for their students. It’s changed their attitudes and beliefs and how they support these children. Her personal belief is very clearly reflected in the school motto ‘Student Success is the Only Option’.

“Among other things, Ms Anaru is involved in the National Aspiring Principals’ Programme and the First Time Principals’ Programme sharing her experience with others. She also works with Maori and Pasifika groups, health and youth providers and a variety of other community groups.

Ms Ngarewa also became a first time principal in 2010 and has achieved incredible results in a short time at Tamatea High School under her leadership. Student achievement at Level 2 alone has gone from 40 per cent in 2009 to 87 per cent last year.

“Ms Ngarewa insists on every child having their own learning pathway and has built a team that believes in these children and supports them to achieve.

“The Ministry of Education is now showing other schools how to implement some of Ms Ngarewa’s inspirational practices to get best results for more of our young people. She also sits on the He Kakano Advisory Committee on Maori Achievement.”

Ms Parata says there are many excellent teachers and principals throughout the country and Ms Anaru and Ms Ngarewa’s success is a reflection of that.

“It’s incredibly exciting to see what a difference strong and passionate leadership and belief in students can make.”
