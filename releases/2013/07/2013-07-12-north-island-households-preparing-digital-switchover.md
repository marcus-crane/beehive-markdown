Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss has welcomed research showing that at least 91 per cent of homes in the North Island have now made the switch to digital television.

The latest research shows that 91 per cent of homes in the Lower North Island and 92 per cent of homes in the Upper North Island have gone digital.  

The Lower North Island makes the switch to digital television on 29 September and the Upper North Island will go digital on 1 December. The South Island made the switch to digital television earlier this year. Nationally the digital conversion rate has increased three per cent to 94 per cent since April 2013. 

“The results show the Going Digital team is doing a great job, but there are still thousands of North Island households that need to make the switch to digital TV. I recommend everyone wanting to go digital does so as well before their regional switchover deadline to avoid the risk of not being able to watch TV,” says Mr Foss. 

“You do not need a new TV set to go digital. Almost all televisions can be made digital ready with a set-top box. If you’re already watching Freeview, Sky, Igloo or Vodafone TV (Wellington region only) then you don’t need to do anything because you’re already watching digital TV,” says Mr Foss.
