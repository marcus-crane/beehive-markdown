All low decile primary schools will have social workers to help protect and support children, by the end of the next school term.

“I’m really pleased we’ve been able to expand the number of social workers, adding an extra 149 frontline staff around the country.”

“Social Workers in Schools (SWiS) do an outstanding job of protecting children, they’re a vital frontline response to preventing and addressing abuse and neglect,” says Mrs Bennett.

The first two stages of the expansion covered Northland, Greater Auckland, Hawke’s Bay, and South Island schools.

The third and final stage of the expansion to this service provides 55 extra social workers to 184 schools across Waikato, Tauranga, Bay of Plenty, the Western and Lower North Island regions and Greater Wellington.

The expansion of SWiS to all decile 1-3 schools increases the coverage from

285 to 670 schools, allowing 142,000 children to access a social worker.

It will cost $11.1 million per year to cover the extra 385 schools with SWiS.

“Social Workers in Schools work with children, their families and teachers to understand what’s going on and take action where needed.”

Frontline Child, Youth and Family positions are also being boosted with an extra 96 social workers and supervisors joining the ranks, all of these staff are at work now and making a difference.

The extra frontline staff will cost $10.3 million per year.
