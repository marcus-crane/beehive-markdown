Prime Minister John Key met today for bilateral talks with Korea’s new President Park Geun-hye at the ‘Blue House’ in Seoul.

President Park took office as Korea’s first woman head of state in February 2013.

“I congratulated President Park on a successful start to her administration,” Mr Key says.

“The President is a good friend of New Zealand. She first visited in 1968 accompanying her father, President Park Chung-hee, and was most recently here in 2008.

“New Zealand’s contemporary relationship with Korea is close, strong and successful.

“Our discussions today covered many areas of cooperation including trade, tourism, science and technology, and defence.

“I made the President aware of the importance we place on getting a free trade agreement in place so that New Zealand companies can compete on an equal footing in the Korean marketplace with the US and other countries with which Korea has concluded FTAs.

“I have also indicated New Zealand’s support for the President’s efforts at trust and confidence-building with North Korea, and for international efforts to persuade the North to give up its nuclear weapons programme.

“I thanked the President for the warm reception which Korea has given to war veterans from New Zealand and other countries for the armistice commemorations.

“The President referred to Korea’s on-going gratitude for the contribution of New Zealand and other countries during the Korean War.

“I have extended an invitation for President Park to visit New Zealand when her schedule permits.”

Mr Key is visiting Korea with a group of New Zealand veterans to take part in commemorations marking the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice.
