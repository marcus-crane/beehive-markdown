Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says a new departure card is in circulation from today.

The simplified form features seven fewer questions for visitors than the old one. Visitors will be required to answer six questions before signing the declaration. New Zealanders will have to answer 12 questions.

“The new card reflects that we don’t need to know certain information, such as the residential addresses visitors stayed at while in the country. We’ll only ask for information that we can’t get from anywhere else.

“Three million new departure cards have been sent to airports, airlines and travel agents. The old departure form will still be able to be used as the new one is phased in,” Maurice Williamson says.

The information collected from the departure card is used for statistics such as population numbers, and inflation in the Consumers Price Index.

Statistics New Zealand, Customs and Immigration worked together on the new card.

“The next step is to eventually collect all departure information electronically. Customs will lead work on how to do this,” Mr Williamson says.
