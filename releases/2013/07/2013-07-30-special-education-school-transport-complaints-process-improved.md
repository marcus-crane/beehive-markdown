Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye has today announced a new complaints process and more accessible information for the special education school transport assistance (SESTA) services.

This is one of the first outcomes of a review carried out by the SESTA Reference Group which is made up of representatives from the education sector, families who use SESTA services, and transport operators. The group has also developed an accessible brochure (available from 2 September) that will help families have better information about the service.

"More than 4500 students are being transported by SESTA every day and it is our responsibility to ensure families and schools are confident that the transport assistance is safe, reliable and responsive to their changing needs,” Ms Kaye says.

“The new complaints process is easier to understand and provides clear steps to resolving issues.

“There will be clearer lines of communications between all groups, which will ensure complaints are dealt with much more quickly and effectively.

“The new process will take effect from 2 September 2013 and all complaints will be acknowledged within 24 hours.

“The service supports some of our most vulnerable young people and they deserve to have safe and reliable transport.

“I am really pleased that this new complaints process has been designed by the reference group and has had the input of parents whose children use the service.”

Reference group Chair Graeme Daniel (Principal, Allenvale Special School) says the input into the complaints process from all members of the group has been important.

“The new process will ensure families and schools have more than one avenue to address their concerns about any aspect of the special education transport service,” Mr Daniel says.

“I’m confident that the review undertaken by the SESTA reference group will strengthen the transport service, reduce disruptions and improve how transport operators and the Ministry of Education respond to issues and I thank the group for their work on this,” Ms Kaye says.

The SESTA reference group’s next priorities are providing additional support to students, increasing student independence, and maintaining a strong focus on service safety.
