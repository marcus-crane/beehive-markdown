Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy announced today that additional resources will be placed into the crucial market of China, following a meeting with AQSIQ Vice Minister Wei Chuanzhong.

“Two new Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) staff will be stationed in China by the end of the year, in addition to a number of locally engaged staff,” says Mr Guy.

The meeting at AQSIQ follows Mr Guy’s meeting with Chinese Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu earlier this week.

“Both meetings were very positive, and all parties reaffirmed their desire to maintain and build upon our established relationships.

“Managing connections between New Zealand and China is a high priority for this Government. These relationships are vital to be able to work with the Chinese authorities and businesses to ensure that trade – which is in both countries’ interest – flows smoothly. It will also help us deal with any issues that arise in a timely and effective way.

“China is New Zealand’s largest export market, and dramatic growth has seen our trade triple in the past five years. This has been driven by China’s economic growth, the Free Trade Agreement with China and New Zealand’s strong reputation for food safety.

“I invited Vice-minister Wei to New Zealand to personally see the systems New Zealand has in place to assure the world that our produce is high quality and safe.

“AQSIQ officials will also be visiting New Zealand next week to begin work on new meat certification documents.

“The new MPI staff in China will bring a combination of technical and policy expertise.

“When Minister Han Changfu was in New Zealand in April this year we signed a Strategic Plan on Promoting Agricultural Cooperation. Additional resources in China will help us get the most out of that arrangement, and other arrangements we have between our two countries,” says Mr Guy.
