Minister of Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce has welcomed the release of the 2012 Education Performance Indicators, which show continued strong performance by tertiary providers for their students.

“The changes we have made to the tertiary education sector to reward performance, instead of just getting “bums on seats”, are continuing to work,” Mr Joyce says. “More students are staying in study, achieving credits and qualifications, and progressing further.”

The data shows how tertiary providers receiving student achievement component (SAC) funding are performing by measuring providers against four Educational Performance Indicators (EPIs): course completion rates; qualification completion rates; student progression at levels 1-4; and student retention.

“It’s pleasing to see qualification completion rates improve across all sub-sectors from 2011 to 2012, which continues the positive trend seen from 2010 to 2011. Twenty five of 29 organisations reported increases in qualification completions, with the largest increases reported by Massey University – up 23 points – and the Open Polytechnic, up 19 points,” Mr Joyce says.

“I’m also pleased Māori and Pasifika results are continuing to improve. Māori qualification completion levels increased by 6 per cent between 2011 and 2012 – to 65 per cent – and student retention levels increased by 5 per cent to 62 per cent.

“Pasifika qualification completion rates, student progression rates, and student retention rates all increased by 5 per cent between 2011 and 2012,” Mr Joyce says.

Other results include:

- Qualification completion and student retention rates for students under 25 both increased, to 70 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.
- In 2012 the average course completion rate for universities remained steady at 86 per cent, and was 79 per cent for Institutes of Technology and Polytechs (up 1 per cent).
- Thirteen ITPs reported an improved rate of course completion, with the Open Polytechnic reporting a 7 per cent improvement.
- All but one ITP reported an improvement in student progression.

“The data shows that our tertiary education providers are maintaining high performance levels, while also ensuring our priority group learners, such as Māori and Pasifika students, continue to improve and achieve better results,” Mr Joyce says.
