The online tool that has helped over 6,000 health workers increase their cultural competency in its first year will remain available at no cost, at least until 31 March 2014, confirmed Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

“Culture is about much more than simple superficial differences. Health professionals who understand this communicate more effectively and that can make all the difference - especially for those who find it difficult to access the care and services they need,” says Mrs Turia.

“Being able to offer culturally competent care and support can increase people’s willingness to seek support from health practitioners and health services, and increases their likelihood of sticking to their treatment plans.”

The tool was delivered by Mauri Ora Associates on behalf of the Ministry of Health and launched in June 2012.  It incorporates the *Foundation Course in Cultural Competency*, which provides a basic understanding of cultural competency and health literacy. The multimedia course is available at no cost and takes about an hour to complete.

Cultural competence training can help update the knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals, allowing them to be more ‘in tune’ with clients and patients. It provides people a much more accessible and welcoming service and can make a very positive difference to patient outcomes and experiences.

The *Foundation Course in Cultural Competency* provides an understanding of New Zealand’s culturally diverse population, with an emphasis on Maori culture. The course highlights the importance of supporting health literacy and ensuring health professionals are skilled at providing health information in a way that people can easily understand and use.

Since its launch in June 2012, the online tool has been freely available to health professionals, via the Mauri Ora Associates website at [www.mauriora.co.nz](http://www.mauriora.co.nz), and has been accessed by over 6000 users – including people who have taken groups from their organisation through the various online modules.

“Cultural competency is a key skill for health professionals. It ensures we are more consistently able to provide patients and their whanau with health information in a way they can understand,” says Mrs Turia.

“The course has received very positive feedback and I am pleased to see it continue to be available in this format.”
