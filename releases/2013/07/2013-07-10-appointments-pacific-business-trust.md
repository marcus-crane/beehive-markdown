Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata today announced three key appointments to the Pacific Business Trust Board.

Ms Selma Scott, of Samoan descent, will chair the Pacific Business Trust Board, replacing Caren Rangi.

“Selma’s legal background and long-term membership of the board offer a perspective which will be of great benefit to Pacific businesses,” Ms Parata says.

“Her skills and experience as an existing board member will provide continuity and stability for the Board.”

Ms Scott, a principal in her own law practice, has been a member of the Board since April 2007. Her appointment has been extended and she has agreed to chair replacing Caren Rangi, who has resigned for personal reasons.

“I have also made two new appointments to the board. They are Ms Repeka Lelaulu and Mr Teremoana Kenneth Mato. Both have been appointed for three-year terms.”

Mr Mato has a wealth of international experience in exports, trade, and investments and Ms Lelaulu has extensive experience in the private sector including 21 years in real estate.

Ms Parata paid tribute to Ms Rangi, who had made a valuable contribution to the board since being appointed chair on 1 April 2012.

“It was with regret that I accepted Caren’s resignation. She brought to the role not only knowledge of the Pacific business development environment and of the Trust, but considerable experience in governance, public sector auditing and strategic organisational management.”

The Pacific Business Trust (the Trust) is a charitable trust, established in 1985 and incorporated under the Charitable Trust Act 1957. It works to develop a strong economic base for Pacific peoples in New Zealand by providing opportunities through business participation and ownership.
