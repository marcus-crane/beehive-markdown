Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson has congratulated everyone who worked on acclaimed filmmaker Jane Campion's New Zealand-filmed mini-series Top of the Lake on receiving eight nominations in the 2013 Primetime Emmy Awards.

Top of the Lake was shot in Central Otago and received support from the Ministry of Culture and Heritage’s Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF), administered by the New Zealand Film Commission. The fund is available to medium to large scale productions that have significant New Zealand content.

“New Zealand has an excellent reputation for producing top quality screen productions and we know the incentives bring economic and cultural benefits to both the country and that industry,” Mr Finlayson said. “Top of the Lake is being enjoyed by audiences all over the world and this long list of nominations will further promote the New Zealand screen industry internationally.”

The six-part series has earned international acclaim since its premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in January. It is nominated in the following categories:

Outstanding TV Miniseries or Movie; Oustanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie (Elisabeth Moss); Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or Movie (Jane Campion and Gerard Lee); Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or A Dramatic Special (Jane Campion and Garth Davis); Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (Peter Mullan); Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Kirsty McGregor, Tina Cleary); Oustanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or Movie (Adam Arkapaw, Part 1); Oustanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or a Movie (Part 5).

Jane Campion co-directed Top of the Lake with Garth Davis and co-wrote the project with Gerard Lee. Philippa Campbell was the New Zealand producer.
