The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee, Local Government Minister Chris Tremain, and Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson, have welcomed the decision by Mayor Bob Parker to seek the appointment of a Crown Manager to address consenting issues.

“I am pleased that Christchurch City Council has recognised the gravity of the situation and that a motion will now be put to the council to invite the Government to appoint Crown Manager,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This decision will ensure they get a robust consenting system in place, and is a constructive and welcome step forward.”

Mr Tremain says this move is a positive step which will enable a Crown Manager to be appointed more quickly for the benefit of Christchurch.

“I look forward to meeting the council tomorrow following their decision, to discuss the terms of reference which will enable a Crown Manager to be appointed at the earliest opportunity,” Mr Tremain says.

“The Crown Manager will have the authority to direct the council to address issues relating to consenting.

“The Council will be required by legislation to cooperate with the Crown Manager, comply with the Manager’s directions, and comply with any reasonable request to provide relevant information.

“This process relies on the new assistance and intervention framework included in the Better Local Government legislation passed last year.

“This framework gives the Government a menu of options which enables us to work collaboratively with the Council in the first instance.

“Under the previous legislation, the only intervention options would have been to appoint Commissioners or call an election.”

Mr Williamson says he has instructed the specialist team from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to continue working with the council, as they have been doing over the past two weeks.

“They will also work with International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) to get a better understanding of the issues raised on Campbell Live yesterday evening,” Mr Williamson says.

Mr Brownlee says today’s move is a result which will ensure Christchurch City Council regains IANZ accreditation as soon as possible, in the meantime the Crown Manager will work with the council to ensure people receiving consents have confidence in the issuing process.
