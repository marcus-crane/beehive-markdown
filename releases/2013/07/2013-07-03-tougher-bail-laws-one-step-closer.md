A Bill that will make it harder for serious offenders to get bail passed its second reading in Parliament today.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the Bail Amendment Bill delivers the Government’s commitment to reviewing the current bail system to improve New Zealanders’ safety.

“This Government is committed to bail laws that make New Zealand safer, protect the public, and keep victims at the heart of our criminal justice system.  These changes will help deliver on this commitment.”

Ms Collins says measures in the Bill strike the right balance between public safety and a defendant’s right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.

Proposed changes to bail laws to improve public safety include:

- increasing the number of situations where a defendant will be subject to a reverse burden of proof in bail decisions.  A reverse burden of proof means that the defendant has to prove that he or she should be released on bail, rather than the prosecutor proving that the defendant should not be released on bail.
- young defendants aged 17 will now be subject to the standard test for bail if they have previously been sentenced to imprisonment.  All defendants aged 18 and 19 will now be subject to the standard test for bail.

<!--THE END-->

- new powers to deal with defendants under 17 years of age who breach their bail conditions.  Police will be able to arrest a young defendant who repeatedly breaches their bail conditions.

<!--THE END-->

- legislating the electronically monitored bail regime to ensure consistent practices in courts across New Zealand.

Ms Collins praised the work of the Law and Order Committee and thanked those who made submissions on the Bill.

The Government intends to pass the Bail Amendment Bill by the end of 2013.
