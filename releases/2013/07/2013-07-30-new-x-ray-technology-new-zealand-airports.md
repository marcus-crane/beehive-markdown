New Zealand’s border inspection system is set to gain a new fleet of x-ray machines, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced at Horticulture NZ’s annual conference today.

Eleven x-ray machines will replace existing machines at Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and Queenstown airports used to inspect both the checked-in and hand luggage of people arriving in New Zealand.

Auckland and Christchurch will also receive new technology to reduce the amount of handling required to load and unload luggage onto and off the x-ray machines.

“The new x-ray images will be of a better quality than we currently have, which will make Quarantine Inspectors’ jobs easier and more efficient,” says Mr Guy.

“This is the first step of a major equipment replacement programme as part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen New Zealand’s biosecurity system.

“This investment in one of the tools that the Ministry for Primary Industries uses at the border, along with the continuing recruitment of frontline Quarantine Inspectors and increases in dog handler teams,” says Mr Guy.

This follows an announcement earlier this month of new x-ray trials at Auckland airport to screen airline baggage from Melbourne before it arrives in New Zealand.

The trials are a world-first and have the potential to be extended to other major airports.
