Justice Minister Judith Collins has today announced the success of the safe@home programme as 300 families at risk of being re-victimised from domestic abuse are supported to stay in their own homes.

Safe@home, delivered by Auckland charity Shine and supported by the Government, helps make victims’ homes safer from attack by replacing glass panelled doors with solid doors, installing security lights, changing locks and repairing broken windows.

“So far safe@home has helped around 900 women and children, stay in their own homes so they can avoid the further trauma and upheaval of having to relocate from their home and community,” Ms Collins says.

“By making their homes safer and more secure we are giving these families tools to help keep them safe from continued abuse.”

The Government has invested $1 million from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2014 to expand the safe@home programme into Christchurch, Counties Manukau and Tauranga.

Today Ms Collins acknowledged Shine’s contribution to ensuring victims, particularly vulnerable women and children, are better protected from repeat victimisation.

“This Government is committed to stopping crime before it happens – but we cannot do it alone. It’s a team effort that involves strong partnerships to be formed between central government, local government, police, community organisations and residents,” Ms Collins says.

“I thank Shine for sharing this Government’s commitment to putting victims at the heart of our justice system.”
