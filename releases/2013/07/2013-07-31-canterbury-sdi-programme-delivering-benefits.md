The Canterbury Spatial Data Infrastructure programme is delivering new ways to assist the Canterbury earthquake recovery, Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says.

A new planning tool has been developed as a part of the Forward Works Spatial Coordination project. It will allow recovery agencies’ forward works, and utilities, to be viewed in an integrated way, with timeframes, locations, and other relevant attributes.

“This will allow more efficient planning and sequencing of public sector construction activities, and will help coordination with private sector landowners and property developers on their works planning.

“For example, instead of digging up a road and the nearby area multiple times for various bits of work, recovery agencies can now plan to do it once because they know what each other needs to do in that area.

“This will help maximise the pace and efficiency of the recovery and minimise costs and disruption due to scheduling clashes,” Mr Williamson says.

Agencies, with leadership from Land Information New Zealand, are currently developing a shared view of current and future horizontal infrastructure and built environment construction, repair and maintenance activities.

The Canterbury SDI programme began in 2012 to address barriers to data sharing, provide solutions to harnessing web technology and to facilitate 3D visualisation.
