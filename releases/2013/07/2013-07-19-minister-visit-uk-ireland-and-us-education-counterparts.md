Education Minister Hekia Parata will travel to the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States next week for bilateral meetings with her counterparts.

“These meetings are an opportunity to raise further awareness of New Zealand’s education brand, and promote our education system. It will also be a chance to discuss topics of relevance to our education system such as equity in education, improving the quality of teaching, and effective civics education,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Parata will also use the opportunity to personally invite the Education Ministers to the fourth International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP) which New Zealand will host in March 2014

“The ISTP is an opportunity to showcase the great things happening in the New Zealand education system and to learn from international experience and best practice.

“It will be a chance to help with our challenges, while promoting the high quality of the New Zealand education system to the world.”
