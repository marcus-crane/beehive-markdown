Customs Minister Maurice Williamson announced today the introduction of SmartGate to United States and United Kingdom ePassport holders on departure.

SmartGate is Customs’ automated passenger processing system, which has been used by six million people since its introduction in 2009.

“Building on the success and popularity of SmartGate with New Zealanders and Australians, the system is now being made available to eligible US and UK ePassport holders departing New Zealand.

“I’m sure eligible passengers will be just as impressed with how quick and easy it is to use the technology,” Mr Williamson says.

SmartGate uses the information in ePassports and facial recognition technology to perform customs and immigration checks. The technology improves border security by allowing Customs to focus on high-risk travellers.

About 50,000 people use the automated self-processing system each week. Twenty two gates are in operation at Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch airports for both departures and arrivals.

Customs is currently trialling a prototype of the next generation of SmartGate, called SmartGate Plus, at Auckland International Airport. SmartGate Plus is a more intuitive one-step concept, where the passport is scanned at the gate, eliminating the need for the kiosk and ticket.

“It’s great New Zealand is able to play a part in the evolution of this technology, and another example of how the Government is always looking for new ways to improve the passenger experience,” Mr Williamson says.
