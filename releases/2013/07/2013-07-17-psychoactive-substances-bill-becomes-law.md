Associate Health Minister Todd McClay and Police Minister Anne Tolley welcomed the enactment today of the Psychoactive Substances Bill. As of midnight, a range of effective prohibitions and penalties for breaches of the new law come into immediate effect. These include:

- No sales from dairies or any sort of grocery store,  petrol stations, or anywhere alcohol is sold;
- No sales to under 18 year olds;
- No advertising, except at the point of sale;
- Strict labelling requirements.

“After more than two years of considerable hard work, New Zealand finally has a tool with which to address the scourge of unregulated psychoactive substances,” says Mr McClay.

“I have travelled across New Zealand, from Putaruru, to Dannevirke to Invercargill and listened to concerned communities telling me that we need to stop these products falling into the hands of our young people. This Act will achieve this. From midnight tonight these products will be gone from the hundreds of neighbourhood dairies that chose to make a quick buck from selling these products, rather than putting the wishes of their communities first.”

Those that flout this ban face prosecution and substantial penalties of up to $10,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a body corporate. Mr McClay will personally visit dairies in his electorate over the coming weeks to ensure that they are complying.

“To those under 18 thinking of using these products, or those contemplating supplying them, take my advice, it’s just not worth it, says Mr McClay.

The Act also puts an end to the cat and mouse situation that had developed with the temporary class drug regime, with drugs currently subject to temporary class drug notices made under the Misuse of Drugs Act continuing to be prohibited from sale.

“This new law provides a valuable tool for our Police out in communities," says Mrs Tolley.

"These products have had a shocking effect on young people and their families, and up until now, frontline officers have had to deal with the consequences. Now Police can be proactive, and with the help of the public we can ensure that this new law is successfully enforced."

The Ministry of Health has developed a website to address queries regarding psychoactive substances, which went live last Friday.
