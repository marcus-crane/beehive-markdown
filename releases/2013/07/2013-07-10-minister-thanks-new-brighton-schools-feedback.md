Education Minister Hekia Parata has thanked the three New Brighton schools in greater Christchurch for providing feedback on the new proposals announced in May.

"I would like to thank the New Brighton school communities for continuing to engage in the consultation process, for the effort each school put into their feedback, and for their prompt response. I will carefully consider all of the information provided before making my decision,’’ Ms Parata says.

Ms Parata announced in May that three schools in New Brighton (North New Brighton, Central New Brighton and Freeville) were subject to two new proposals, which would be consulted on together.

The two new proposals are to either:

·        merge Central New Brighton, Freeville School and North New Brighton School on the North New Brighton site, or to

·        close Central New Brighton and finalise the interim decision to merge Freeville and North New Brighton on the North New Brighton site.

“School communities came up with these proposals during the consultation process and we thought they warranted further investigation and consultation, so I am happy that is occurring.

“While I appreciate these further options extend the decision making process for these three schools and their communities, it’s important we get this right.”

Ms Parata says the Government is investing $1 billion into renewing and restoring the education sector over the next ten years.  

“At the end of this process, greater Christchurch will have one of the best and most modern schooling networks in the country.”

A decision for the New Brighton schools will be announced in September.

***Note:***

Of the 215 schools in greater Christchurch, 177 schools, or more than 80 per cent, are not affected by the Government’s proposals.

Of the 38 schools covered in the original proposals announced in September last year, 28 schools have final decisions.

Two schools (Hammersley Park and Le Bons Bay) have already closed voluntarily.

Five Aranui schools have an interim decision, and a final decision will be announced in September.

Three schools in New Brighton (North New Brighton, Central New Brighton and Freeville) are now subject to two new proposals, which are being consulted on together. A decision will be announced in September.
