Social Development Minister Paula Bennett announces the appointment of Belinda Milnes as Chief Families Commissioner.

“Ms Milnes is well positioned to lead the Families Commission, having been interim Chief Commissioner since February this year.”

An independent panel said Ms Milnes had demonstrated good judgement in her current role and has a broad knowledge of the Commission’s role and direction as well as the current legislative changes.

“The Families Commission is undergoing changes that will see it become a centre of best practise and evidence.”

“This role will enable Government to make evidence-based decisions in policy formation and non-government organisations will be able to access independent research and evaluation,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Ms Milnes is more than capable of leading the Families Commission, she has a good team and they all have my support.”

The appointment of Chief Commissioner runs for three years.
