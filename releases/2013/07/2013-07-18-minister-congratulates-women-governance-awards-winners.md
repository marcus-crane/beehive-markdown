Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has today congratulated the winners of the inaugural Women in Governance Awards.

“These awards are an important initiative to help promote greater gender diversity at senior management and board level in the private sector,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“I was delighted to attend the awards ceremony in Auckland last night. I congratulate Supreme Award winner Alison Paterson and acknowledge all the winners for their contributions to New Zealand companies and organisations.”

The seven awards, presented by Women on Boards New Zealand in association with NEXT Magazine, recognise organisations and individuals achieving gender diversity in leadership, governance and sport governance.

The supreme award goes to a woman whose career represents excellence in governance and who has positively contributed to the advancement of gender diversity.

“Research shows that women provide diverse views, innovative ideas and approaches to risk, and are well placed to link to customers, investors and stakeholders. All of which produces better results for the organisation’s bottom line,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Women on Boards New Zealand is just one of many current private sector initiatives that aim to increase the number women in leadership roles.

“The representation of women in private sector leadership increased from 9.3 per cent to 14.75 per cent between 2010 and 2012. I look forward to continuing to work with organisations such as Women on Boards, the 25 Percent Group, Global Women and the Institute of Directors and others to build on this momentum.”
