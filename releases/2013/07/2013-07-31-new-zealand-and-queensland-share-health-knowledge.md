New Zealand and Queensland have agreed to work together in sharing health expertise.

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and Health Minister Tony Ryall have today signed a collaboration arrangement between the Ministry of Health and Queensland’s Department of Health.

Mr Ryall says it will create formal opportunities to transfer knowledge and foster closer working relationships.

“For example, Queensland is interested in New Zealand’s e-medication approach, and pharmaceutical purchasing arrangements. Equally, Queensland has experience in tele-health in rural areas that could provide valuable insights for New Zealand,” Mr Ryall says.

Health officials from New Zealand and Queensland will now begin work towards realising the exchange of information and strategies.

Premier Newman’s visit to New Zealand includes meeting health sector leaders and observing innovative health technology in use at the Canterbury District Health Board.
