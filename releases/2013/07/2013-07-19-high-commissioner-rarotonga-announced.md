Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of Joanna Kempkers as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands.

“The Cooks Islands is one of our closest neighbours and we have a special relationship founded on close historical ties, unique constitutional arrangements and a common citizenship and currency,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Kempkers has previously served as Deputy High Commissioner in the Cook Islands and Fiji, Trade Advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Pacific Division and as part of the New Zealand delegation to the OECD in France.
