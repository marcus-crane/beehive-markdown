Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the release of two new emergency response guidance publications that will see vulnerable groups better supported.

“The guidance for people with disabilities and for culturally and linguistically diverse communities will ensure that civil defence responders better plan for these groups and that they are better supported during emergencies,” Ms Kaye says.

The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management’s (MCDEM) guidance publications provide consistent advice for all local authorities, the 16 regional Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Groups throughout New Zealand, and other agencies that plan for and respond to emergencies.

“Following the Canterbury earthquakes it was clear that more needed to be done to provide support and better understand the issues faced by both culturally and linguistically diverse communities and people with disabilities,” Ms Kaye says.

“The publications released today aim to address some of the concerns raised with MCDEM Director John Hamilton. It is essential that all members of communities have access to vital information both before and during emergency responses.

“This was a key priority identified from the earthquake response.”

Today’s launch is the start of a rolling review of MCDEM’s guidance publications and other information the Ministry produces. The aim is to ensure all are up-to-date and reflect best practice.

“The Canterbury earthquakes showed us New Zealanders stepping up and looking after their communities’ most vulnerable. These guidance documents are about ensuring Government and community groups can better support our most vulnerable in future events,” Ms Kaye says.
