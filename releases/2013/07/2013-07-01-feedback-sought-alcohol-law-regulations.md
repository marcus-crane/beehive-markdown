Justice Minister Judith Collins today released a public discussion document, inviting feedback on proposed regulations needed to implement the new alcohol laws.

“These regulations will help give effect to this government’s commitment to placing tighter controls on the sale, supply and promotion of alcohol,” Ms Collins says.

“The regulations will support decision makers, enforcement officials and local communities to play their part reducing alcohol-related harm in New Zealand.”

The discussion document covers proposed regulations relating to:

- Local alcohol policies
- Licensee obligations
- Licensing system
- Defining grocery stores
- Qualifications needed for obtaining a manager’s certificate
- Evidence of age documents
- Infringement offences
- Alcohol control areas
- Remote sales
- Licensing and community trusts

“These proposals provide opportunity for the industry, communities and other interested parties to have their say and offer their solutions for the regulatory framework for the new alcohol laws,” Ms Collins says.

Consultation on the proposed regulations to give effect to the new alcohol laws will run until 26 July 2013.

The discussion document is available on [http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/sale-and-supply-of-alcohol/regulation-of-alcohol/policy/sale-and-supply-of-alcohol/development-of-regulations-and-fees](http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/sale-and-supply-of-alcohol/regulation-of-alcohol/policy/sale-and-supply-of-alcohol/development-of-regulations-and-fees)
