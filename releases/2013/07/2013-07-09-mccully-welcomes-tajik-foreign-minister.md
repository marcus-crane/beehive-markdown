Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully held talks with his counterpart from the Republic of Tajikistan, HE Hamrokhon Zarifi, in Auckland today.

“Mr Zarifi’s visit is the first by a minister from the Republic of Tajikistan and presents an excellent opportunity to develop closer ties between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully and Mr Zarifi shared perspectives on regional security issues, and reaffirmed New Zealand and Tajikistan’s commitment to multilateralism as a means for strengthening international security.

Following the meeting, Mr McCully and Mr Zarifi signed a joint statement recognising opportunities to expand the bilateral relationship through trade, agriculture, energy and tourism.
