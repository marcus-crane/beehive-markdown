Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has today announced that 29 local authorities will benefit from this year’s Youth Development Partnership Fund totalling $889,000.

“These councils, from throughout New Zealand, are working with young people to develop the skills, knowledge and experience they need to participate and be part of their communities,” Ms Kaye says.

“This fund enables councils to be innovative and inclusive in the ways they work with young people in their community and bring their voice and influence to local decision-making.

“It offers one-off assistance to territorial authorities for projects that support young people aged 12 to 24.

“Funding this year ranges from $10,000 to $51,000 per project. The money enables central and local government - along with the community - to invest in young people leading and delivering youth focused projects.

“With last year’s $50,000 funding for example, Dunedin City Council’s Student Community Involvement Programme engaged 225 young people in volunteering activities for 54 community projects. These included fund raising for St John’s Ambulance Service and Dog Rescue Dunedin via bake sales and sewing soft toys to donate to children at the Te Whara Pounamu Dunedin Woman’s Refuge.” 

Since the launch of the Youth Development Partnership Fund in 2005, 57 councils have received funding. Examples of projects funded include:

- Youth councils undertaking community wide surveys that contribute to Council Action Plans
- Young people leading and participating in volunteering activities
- Young people developing skills and implementing projects and events in their communities for others.

Information on councils receiving funding can be found on the Ministry of Youth Development’s website [www.myd.govt.nz/funding](http://www.myd.govt.nz/funding/)
