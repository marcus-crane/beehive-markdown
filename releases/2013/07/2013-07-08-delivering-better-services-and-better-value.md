The Government is delivering better public services while at the same time ensuring taxpayers receive better value from the many billions of dollars invested in them, State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman says.

“We are co-ordinating efforts across departments in areas such as procurement, ICT and property management. Taxpayer money freed up by more efficient approaches is being put to better use elsewhere,” he says.

“The Property Management Centre of Expertise was set up to manage public sector office accommodation in a more efficient way, saving an estimated $110 million a year in three to four years’ time.

“A five-agency deal currently being negotiated in Wellington aims to avoid costs to the public sector of approximately $339 million over the next 20 years, representing a 20 per cent savings and a 30 per cent reduction in property footprint.”

Dr Coleman says legislation before Parliament will ensure public services maintain the momentum to deliver better services to New Zealanders.

“The Government’s Better Public Services results areas are about delivering what New Zealanders really want and expect from their public services. They include difficult issues like reducing crime, reducing long-term welfare dependence and reducing educational under-achievement.

“The State Sector and Public Finance Reform Bill is the biggest change to the public service in a generation, and forms a part of this Government’s dedication to our Better Public Services targets.

“It provides the means to foster an innovative, efficient public sector to deliver clear results for New Zealanders. The Head of State Services will have the powers to ensure this happens.

“New Zealanders expect improved public services, and we need the public service to continue to find ways of working to deliver better value and results.”
