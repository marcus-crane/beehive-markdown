Child, Youth and Family and Ngāti Porou have signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing to work together to better protect vulnerable children.

“Ngāti Porou want better outcomes for their children, and the agreement signed in Gisborne today is a significant step towards achieving this,” Social Development Minister Paula Bennett said.

“The MoU will allow Child, Youth and Family and Ngāti Porou to take meaningful action towards reducing child abuse and neglect on the East Coast.”

The agreement includes a commitment to undertake early and open discussions, and to share responsibility around decisions which impact on vulnerable children and their whānau.

Child, Youth and Family and Ngāti Porou will also work together to develop programmes which ensure support goes where it is most needed, and that early interventions achieve the best outcomes for Ngāti Porou children.

A joint strategy will be developed over the next twelve months based on the shared aspirations of both Child, Youth and family and Ngāti Porou.

There are almost 200 Ngāti Porou children living in care, half of whom live with their extended family.

The total number of children in the custody of Child, Youth and Family is around 4,900, and 53 per cent of them are Māori.

In 2011 Child, Youth and Family established a Māori Leadership Governance Group, Te Pōtae Kōhatu Māori, made up of 18 senior Māori staff members.

Te Pōtae Kōhatu Māori has been designed to strengthen the relationships between Child, Youth and Family and iwi, whānau, and Māori service providers.

Child, Youth and Family have also begun developing new educational tools to support and up-skill staff, so they can better engage with children at risk and their whānau.

This agreement follows a Memorandum of Understanding signed between Child, Youth and Family and Ngāpuhi in August 2012.
