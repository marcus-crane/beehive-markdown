Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today announced funding to strengthen the social sector through the new Capability Investment Resource.

“This is the first round out of a total of $31.65 million in funding, aimed at building a stronger, adaptable and more integrated social sector

The first round of the Capability Investment Resource provides $1.7 million for 233 organisations to use for organisational capability self-assessments and/or planning with Capability Mentors.

“Some groups may benefit from technical assistance, like help with accounting systems, whereas others may need help building networks and collaboration with other community organisations,” says Mrs. Bennett.

Over time the Capability Investment Resource will support providers to work more collaboratively, recognising that collectively they can have more impact than going it alone.

An additional $6.9 million will enable 49 organisations to implement their own capability development plans.

“By helping NGO’s build their capability, we ensure they have the best possible resources and skills to help others,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Ultimately we want providers to be the best that they can be.”

“We provide about $530 million in funding to around 2400 social organisations a year, managed through 4400 contracts.

“It’s essential these providers are as effective, efficient and sustainable as possible to ensure the social services reach the people who need them.”

The first stages of the Capability Investment Resource will help providers assess where they need to make improvements, create a concrete plan of action and make it happen.

The second round of the Capability Investment Resource opened on 1 July 2013 and closes on 30 August 2013.
