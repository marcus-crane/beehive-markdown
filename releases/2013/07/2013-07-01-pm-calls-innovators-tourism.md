Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today released criteria for applications for funds from the Tourism Growth Partnership, a new government initiative aimed at boosting innovation and lifting productivity in the tourism sector.

“Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the government is making $28 million available over four years to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities and overcome barriers to growth in the tourism sector,” says Mr Key.

The Portfolio Statement sets out the objectives of the Tourism Growth Partnership, and signals the type and scale of projects that will attract investment, as well as who can apply.

The Tourism Growth Partnership is a contestable co-investment programme. For each project approved for investment, the government will provide up to 50 per cent of the required funding.

“Tourism is one of New Zealand’s largest export earners and as such it has a crucial role to play in growing our economy. The Tourism Growth Partnership is part of a significant $158 million investment government is making in tourism as part of Budget 2013,” says Mr Key.

“The $158 million investment is focused on achieving growth in tourism earnings; however, simply attracting more, higher-spending visitors is not enough.

The domestic tourism sector must, through its marketing, distribution chains, products and services, turn this demand into value for businesses and the New Zealand economy.

“The Tourism Growth Partnership will help us capture the benefits from growing the value and number of visitors to New Zealand, it will contribute to the creation of more jobs and increased export earnings. “

The Tourism Growth Partnership will be administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). MBIE will open the first funding round later this year and will call for investment proposals at that time. Full details will be published on the MBIE website.

Mr Key says that the Tourism Growth Partnership is a great opportunity for the tourism sector to identify and respond to new market opportunities.

“New Zealand is a nation of innovators. I encourage the tourism sector to start thinking now about developing proposals for investment, and I look forward to seeing what businesses and tourism providers can achieve through this investment.”
