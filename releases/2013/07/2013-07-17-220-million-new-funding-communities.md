Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board Chris Tremain today announced that over $220 million generated from Lottery profits will be returned to the community this year.

“I’m pleased the Lottery Grants Board is making future focused decisions.  The Board has made improving digital literacy in communities a funding priority. It has confirmed that communities wanting to fund earthquake assessment and strengthening work can also apply for grants,” says Mr Tremain.

“Three statutory bodies, New Zealand Film Commission, Creative New Zealand and Sport New Zealand will receive over $88 million which is a 21 per cent increase on the previous year.  

“The remaining funds are shared between Regional Community Committees and National Committees. Recent examples include half a million dollars for the Wellington Zoo for a new conservation and wildlife exhibit, a two year $50,000 grant for Napier Budget Advisory services and almost $60,000 for Kumeu Arts centre in Auckland.

“This money will make a huge difference to communities up and down the country who will be able to get important projects up and running.

“Increased profits have also enabled funding of $11 million to support projects that protect New Zealand’s environment and heritage, and over $8 million will go to support Marae restoration and development. 

“World War One commemorations are well on track [with a number of projects having their funding approved](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz/vwluResources/Lottery%20World%20War%20One%20Commemorations%20Environment%20and%20Heritage%20Committee%2017%20and%2018%20April%202013/$file/LWEH%20April%202013%20summary.pdf).  Examples include the restoration of a memorial to Māori soldiers in Moutoa Gardens in Whanganui, a mobile World War One exhibition space in the Bay of Plenty, the digitisation of World War One images and developing up to ten memorials of regional significance in Southland.”
