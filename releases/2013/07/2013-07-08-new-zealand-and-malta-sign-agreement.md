Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today signed an agreement with Malta to allow portability of Superannuation and Veteran’s Pensions.

“This Social Security Agreement will allow Maltese living in New Zealand and New Zealanders living in Malta, financial independence.”

The Malta Agreement will cover Superannuation and Veteran’s Pensions, allowing partner countries to pay these benefits and pensions.

The agreement was signed in Malta today by Minister Bennett and Hon Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, Maltese Minister for the Family and Social Solidarity.

Around 23 people will benefit from the Malta Agreement in the first four years, including five New Zealanders living in Malta.

This type of agreement also assists some people to meet residence criteria.

“We currently have eight social security agreements in place with Australia, Canada, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.”

“I’ve just met with my Ministerial counterpart in Croatia to advance a Social Security Agreement with that country which we hope to conclude soon.”

The agreement with Malta reinforces the bilateral relationship with that country which has been supportive to New Zealand in the European Union.
