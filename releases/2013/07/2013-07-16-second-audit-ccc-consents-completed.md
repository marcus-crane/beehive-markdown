Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced no safety problems have been found with a sample of building consents issued by Christchurch City Council this year.

International Accreditation New Zealand revoked the Council’s building consent accreditation a week ago following its inability to bring its processes up to the required standard.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has reviewed 24 consents issued from the past six months. The sample represents a cross-section of building projects, building types and project values ($7,000 to $5.5 million).

“MBIE found while there were administrative processing errors, it concluded the consents are technically sound. This news restores some confidence to the Christchurch rebuild and to the Christchurch City Council,” Mr Williamson says.

Last week, an MBIE audit of 17 consents identified by IANZ in September 2012 as not demonstrating full compliance with the Building Code or Act found incomplete or incorrect administrative processes, but no safety issues.

“A wider audit of recently issued building consents will be conducted by Crown Manager Doug Martin, who started his role this week to improve the building consent function at the Council,” Mr Williamson says.

The Crown Manager will set the parameters for the audit.
