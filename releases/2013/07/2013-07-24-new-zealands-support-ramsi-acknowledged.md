Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman and Police Minister Anne Tolley joined the Prime Minister John Key at today’s celebrations to mark the tenth anniversary of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

“New Zealand has made a significant contribution to security and stability in Solomon Islands through RAMSI, a partnership of Pacific nations established a decade ago,” says Dr Coleman.

“I would like to acknowledge the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel who have served in Solomon Islands since 2003. A number of personnel have deployed several times, and our Reserve Forces have made up a large part of our contribution.

“The continued stable security environment in Solomon Islands means that it is now the right time for the military component of RAMSI to withdraw. Considerable development has taken place in the last ten years, matched by a reducing requirement for the military to play a direct role.”

Over 1,000 NZDF personnel have deployed to Solomon Islands since 2003, working alongside Australian, Tongan and Papau New Guinean military personnel as part of the Combined Task Force (CTF). The NZDF has sent a total of 17 rotations to RAMSI. The last NZDF platoon returned to New Zealand in November 2012. Eight NZDF personnel are currently serving with the CTF.

“Over the next few weeks, a small NZDF Theatre Extraction Team will work closely with Australia to manage the Combined Task Force’s departure. HMNZS Canterbury will extract equipment for return to Australia and New Zealand,” says Dr Coleman.

RAMSI is transitioning to a police-led mission, supporting the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) who are responsible for maintaining law and order.

Police Minister Anne Tolley says New Zealand Police will continue to support the RAMSI Participating Police Force (PPF) to build the capacity of the RSIPF. 17 New Zealand Police are currently deployed to Solomon Islands.

“New Zealand remains committed to supporting the stability and future prosperity of Solomon Islands,” says Mrs Tolley.

“New Zealand Police have made a key contribution over the last decade, providing support to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. A total of 630 New Zealand Police have served in Solomon Islands since 2003.

“As RAMSI transitions to a police-only mission, the emphasis for the RAMSI Participating Police Force is shifting from capacity building towards developing higher skill areas such as investigations, domestic violence and traffic control.”

Over the last decade, a number of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Inland Revenue and Treasury personnel have also provided assistance to RAMSI.

RAMSI was established at the request of the Solomon Islands Government following five years of ethnic tensions and conflict. Endorsed by the Pacific Islands Forum, RAMSI was conceived as a comprehensive long term mission with a mandate to restore civil order, stabilise government finances, promote longer term economic recovery and rebuild the machinery of government.
