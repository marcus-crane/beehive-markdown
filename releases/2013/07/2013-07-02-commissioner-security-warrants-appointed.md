The Governor-General has appointed Hon Sir Bruce Robertson as Commissioner of Security Warrants for a three-year term, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Hon Sir Bruce Robertson has had a distinguished career as a High Court and Court of Appeal judge, says Mr Key.

“Sir Bruce has also held a range of other New Zealand legal, public service, academic, community and sports appointments.”

The appointment of Hon Sir Bruce Robertson was made after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, as is required by statute. His term commences on 7 August.

The Prime Minister says the retiring Commissioner, Hon Sir John Jeffries, has served with distinction in the role since its establishment by Parliament in 1999.

“I would like to thank Sir John for his long service as Commissioner, as a Judge of the High Court, and for his work in other senior public service positions,” says Mr Key.
