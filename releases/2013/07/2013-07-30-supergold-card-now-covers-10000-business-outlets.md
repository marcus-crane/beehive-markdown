\\Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew is delighted that the SuperGold programme has surpassed 10,000 business outlets.

“In the last 18 months the number of SuperGold participating businesses has nearly quadrupled,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The continued growth and success of this programme means that older people can continue to get real value from the SuperGold programme.

“Reaching 10,000 business outlets is a real milestone for the programme and means that there are now more opportunities than ever for cardholders to access discounts across the country.”

During May and June this year, a SuperGold business recruitment campaign targeting the health and wellbeing sectors was undertaken.

“This was a very successful campaign which attracted over 1,200 new businesses to the SuperGold programme,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“New businesses include dental services, pharmacies, physiotherapists, optometrists, chiropractic and osteopathic services, nutritionists, sports facilities/equipment as well as trades, home heating and insulation providers.

“An ongoing focus for me has been increasing the number of participating businesses from provincial and rural areas.  I am therefore very pleased that around 45 per cent of the businesses added in the latest campaign are located outside of the main city centres.”
