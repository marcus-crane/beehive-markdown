Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to East Africa next week for bilateral meetings and to attend the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) regional meeting in the Seychelles.

Mr McCully will meet key ministers in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia, along with the President of the Seychelles, James Michel.

“These meetings are an important opportunity to discuss regional issues, New Zealand’s commitment to security and development in East Africa, trade and business opportunities, as well as our campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.

The Seychelles SIDS meeting is one of a series of regional gatherings being held prior to the 2014 Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States in Samoa.
