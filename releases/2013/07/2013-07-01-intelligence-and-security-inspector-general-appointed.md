The Governor-General has appointed Hon Andrew McGechan as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Hon McGechan has had a distinguished career as a High Court Judge and in various legal, public sector, academic and electoral roles, Mr Key says.

“While the formal term of the appointment is three years, Hon McGechan has indicated he sees his appointment as an interim one, pending likely changes to the role proposed in the GCSB and Related Legislation Amendment Bill currently before the House.

“I’m grateful to Hon McGechan for agreeing to undertake this important oversight role at a time of significant change and scrutiny of the intelligence community,” says Mr Key.

Hon McGechan takes up his appointment today.

The appointment of Hon McGechan was made after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, as is required by statute.

“I would like to thank outgoing Inspector-General, Hon Paul Neazor, for his work in this role since 2004,” says Mr Key.
