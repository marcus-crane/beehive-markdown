Minister of Internal Affairs Chris Tremain has announced that a number of banks will soon be using the RealMe service to enable online banking customers to prove their identity.

“The Department of Internal Affairs has been working with a number of major banks to encourage them to use RealMe. Kiwibank and TSB Bank have confirmed they will use RealMe for their online banking services, and other banks such as Westpac have given very strong commitments. I look forward to more businesses signing up to RealMe in the near future.

“Today’s announcement means that the same identity verification system will be usable not only for the 40 government services already using RealMe, but for online transactions with participating banks as well.

“RealMe is another example of better public services making life easier for New Zealanders. It will soon be a reality that Kiwis can apply for a passport, update their electoral roll details, and open a bank account – all while staying in their living room, and using the same username and password each time they prove their identity.

“RealMe enables proof of identity online to a high degree of confidence. It is the online equivalent of walking up to a counter and showing your driver’s licence or passport. It will also enable New Zealanders to log in to multiple government services with a single username and password.

“It also enables banks to meet their obligations under the new Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism legislation.

“Law changes last year enabled private companies to use RealMe. The banking sector is leading the way, and I hope to see further commercial use of the service in the future.”
