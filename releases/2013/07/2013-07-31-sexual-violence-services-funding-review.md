Taking a lead role for sexual violence services, Minister Bennett is working with a range of government agencies on a review of funding and services.

“The Government recognises the sector does incredibly important work for victims of sexual violence and needs funding certainty,” says Mrs Bennett.

The in-depth review into the sexual violence response sector will look at:

- the efficiency of funding provision
- what drives demand for services
- service duplication and gaps in the sector.

The review will recommend adjustments to funding and infrastructure to help improve the delivery of services in the sexual violence response sector.

Recommendations will be made across education and prevention, crisis response, and crisis support services.

“This work reflects the importance of the work sexual violence service providers do and the difficulties they face,” says Mrs Bennett.

“I’ll be looking for recommendations that will make the sector’s delivery of services stronger and more responsive to those in need.”
