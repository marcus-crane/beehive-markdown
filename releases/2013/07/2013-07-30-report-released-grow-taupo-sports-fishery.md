A report which identifies a number of significant opportunities to grow the Taupo Sports Fishery has been released today by Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith and Tūwharetoa Maori Trust Board chief executive Tamarapa Lloyd.

“The Department of Conservation commissioned an independent review of the sports fishery after public concerns were raised about the health of the trout fishery and a 20 per cent drop in licence sales over the past five years,” Dr Nick Smith says.

“Taupo is synonymous with trout, with the fishery worth $29 million a year to the region and 300 jobs. While the review found the sports fishery is generally in good health, it identified significant opportunities to enhance it. This includes developing an overarching goal for the fishery, growing participation by anglers, improving relationships with stakeholders, and improving the fishery’s governance and management structures.

“Other opportunities include encouraging new anglers into the sport through licensing changes, working better with regional tourism operators, and more proactive communications.”

Dr Smith says DOC will work with its partner in the sports fishery, the Tūwharetoa Maori Trust Board, and key stakeholders to develop a plan to implement the recommendations and ensure the ongoing sustainability of the fishery.

Mr Lloyd says Ngāti Tūwharetoa are looking forward to having a more active role in the governance of the fishery and are interested in some of the opportunities outlined in the report which should benefit the iwi.

“The fishery has become a valuable resource to both the region and Ngāti Tūwharetoa – culturally, socially and economically.  The fishery is a significant contributor to the regional economy and the trust board is interested in ensuring it is well managed and governed.”
