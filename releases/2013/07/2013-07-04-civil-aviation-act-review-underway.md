Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says a review of the Civil Aviation Act 1990 is now underway.

“While the Act is fundamentally sound, it is now over 20 years old and, during this period there have been a number of significant changes in the aviation industry,” Mr Brownlee says.

“New Zealand’s aviation industry earned about $9.7 billion in revenue in 2009, almost as much as the dairy industry.

“By 2015 it is expected to be earning between $12.6 and $15 billion a year.

“The review provides an opportunity to ensure that the Act is not unnecessarily constraining aviation business in New Zealand.

“Aviation is a dynamic industry, and it continues to change rapidly due to increased demand for services, improved technology, the increasing cost of jet fuel and environmental concerns.

“We want to make sure that the Act supports a flexible, responsive regulatory system to support the sector.

“Reviewing the Act also provides an opportunity to refresh and improve its usability and ensure its provisions are current and effective – both for decision-makers, and the aviation community in New Zealand, who are governed by the provisions of the Act,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Ministry of Transport is leading the review, has held preliminary meetings with key stakeholders, begun the policy review work and will complete recommendations by November.

In early 2014, a formal consultation process with stakeholders will be held. Cabinet decisions are expected to be made during the first half of 2014.
