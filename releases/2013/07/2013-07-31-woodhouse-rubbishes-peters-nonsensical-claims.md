Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse has rubbished claims by New Zealand First that the Government is hiding thousands of parent category applications to manipulate immigration figures from China downwards.

The New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, claimed in Parliament today that Immigration New Zealand is stockpiling 5,500 parent category applications.

“Mr Peter’s claims are baseless and confused – it is simply rubbish to say that the Government is stockpiling parent category applications,” Mr Woodhouse says.

INZ is limited in the number of resident visas it can grant under the Parent Category each year to approximately 5,000 people.

“In May 2012 the Government made changes to the Parent Category. The previous policy included consideration of the applicant’s ‘centre of gravity’ which benefited those with one child, and consequently the Chinese.

'We now have a much tighter regime for parent category visas than we had under the Labour - NZ First Government of which Mr Peters was a Minister.”

Under the changes priority is given to migrants who can make a real contribution to New Zealand. Applications from parents who have higher income sponsors, or who bring a guaranteed income or funds, are being processed faster than other applications.

“This means that because more people are interested in applying under the Parent Category than places available, applications can take a while to be processed.

“There is nothing sinister in this and it’s disingenuous of Mr Peters to suggest otherwise.

“The information is out there and figures on parent category applications that have been received by Immigration New Zealand are publicly available on their website.”
