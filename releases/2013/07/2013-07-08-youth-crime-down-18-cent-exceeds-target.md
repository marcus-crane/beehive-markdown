The latest justice sector Better Public Service results - showing a continued drop in total crime, youth crime and reoffending – highlight this Government’s commitment to keeping New Zealanders safe, Justice Minister Judith Collins says.

**Result 7: Reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime**

- **Target:** By June 2017, reduce the crime rate by 15 per cent, reduce the violent crime rate by 20 per cent, reduce the youth crime rate by 5 per cent (against a June 2011 baseline).

From June 2012 to March 2013, youth crime has dropped by 12 per cent and total crime is down 6 per cent. Since June 2011, youth crime has dropped 18 per cent and total crime is down 11 per cent.

**Result 8: Reduce reoffending**

- **Target:** Reduce the re-offending rate by 25 per cent by 2017 (against a June 2011 baseline).

From June 2012 to March 2013, re-offending is down 4 per cent.  Since June 2011, re-offending is down 9 per cent.

“We’re making excellent progress against our reducing crime and reoffending targets – particularly in reducing youth crime,” Ms Collins says.

“Steering young people away from a life of crime, and away from the justice system, will give them a greater chance of reaching their full potential.”

Even though 14- to 20-year-olds make up 10 per cent of the total population, they represent over 30 per cent of all apprehensions.

“If we can stop young people coming before the courts in the first place then we have a better chance of keeping them out of the system altogether,” Ms Collins says.

New justice sector Better Public Services initiatives include:

- Collective Impact Toolbox – this toolbox includes techniques, case studies and instructions to help frontline managers work more effectively to improve frontline services.
- The Hutt Valley innovation project – justice sector operational managers in this area are working together on 10 initiatives including the recent launch of the Hutt Valley Mobile Community Office, raising achievement and achievement in the youth sector (RAAYS) and introducing Māori Wardens in court.
- Expanding restorative justice – restorative justice services have received $4.4 million in extra operating funding over two years from the Justice Sector Fund, which means an extra 2,400 conferences.
- Victim intervention plans – as part of the Policing Excellence programme, more than 400 of these plans have been developed to help break the cycle of repeat victimisation.

“Our results to date show how well the entire justice sector is working together to deliver a safer New Zealand.  I thank the Ministry of Justice, Police, and Corrections for their continued excellent work,” Ms Collins says.
