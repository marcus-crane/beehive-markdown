Minister of Local Government Chris Tremain and Minister for Building and Construction Maurice Williamson met with the Christchurch City Council today to discuss the Terms of Reference for the appointment of a Crown Manager to address issues relating to the Council’s building consenting functions.

“I am pleased that the Council unanimously voted today to request that the Government appoint a Crown Manager,” says Mr Tremain.

“Following the Council’s meeting, I received a written request from Mayor Bob Parker asking me to take this action. We have discussed the Terms of Reference with the Mayor and councillors at a productive meeting this afternoon.

“I expect the Crown Manager to be in place by Monday 15 July. This allows time for an appointment to be finalised, and for the terms of reference to be notified in the Gazette and by public notice as required by law.

“The Crown Manager will focus on the urgent need for broad performance improvements and ensuring the Council has adequate processes and capability in place. This will include overseeing the Council’s building control functions and ensuring that the Council regains accreditation as a building consent authority.

“The Crown Manager will be appointed until December 2014. This enables time to return the Council to a robust organisation that does not require this level of management again in the future.”

Mr Williamson said that the Council’s ability to issue consents will not be affected.

“The Council will lose its building consent accreditation from Monday 8 July. This does not affect the ability of the Council to issue consents. Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment officials will continue providing support to the Council and will work with the Crown Manager.

“I would like to emphasise that staff at the Council have been doing their best. There are good people working hard to issue building consents in a timely and efficient manner. These people need good systems, procedures and leadership to support them.

“The Crown Manager will provide the necessary leadership to overhaul the Council’s building consent functions and enable the Council to regain its accreditation.”
