Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced appointments to seven tertiary education institution councils, which include nine new council members across university and wānanga councils and a new appointment to the Open Polytechnic council.

“I am pleased to welcome these high calibre council appointees into their new roles and to welcome the reappointment of a number of council members in recognition of the high-quality governance they have been providing to these institutions,” Mr Joyce says.

“I also wish to recognise the valuable contribution made by outgoing council members and to thank them for their service.”

The appointments and reappointments of council members are:

- University of Waikato: new appointment of Mr Mike Pohio.
- Lincoln University: new appointments of Dr John Wood (Chancellor of the University Canterbury), Sir Graeme Harrison, and Mr Bruce Gemmell (from 1 December 2013).
- University of Canterbury: new appointments of Mr Tony Hall (Pro Chancellor of Lincoln University), Mr Bruce Gemmell, and the reappointment of Ms Sue McCormack and Ms Catherine Drayton.
- Open Polytechnic: new appointment of Mr Murray Bain as a member, and as Deputy Chair.
- Te Wānanga o Aotearoa: new appointments of Mr Karl Wixon and Mr Rea Wikaira.
- Te Wānanga o Raukawa: new appointment of Ms Daphne Luke and Ms Anne Carter and the reappointment of Ms Queenie Rikihana-Hyland.
- Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi: new appointment of Mr Rauru Kirikiri, Ms Tuihana Pook, and the reappointment of Mr Waaka Vercoe.
- “At Lincoln University and the University of Canterbury I am using an unusual number of appointment opportunities to implement a strategy that will encourage collaboration and cooperation across the two councils.
- “This strategy will also strengthen the high-level financial skills available to councils in their deliberations as these institutions recover from the Canterbury earthquakes,” Mr Joyce says.
