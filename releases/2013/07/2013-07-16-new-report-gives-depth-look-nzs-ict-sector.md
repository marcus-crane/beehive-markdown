An in-depth report into the performance of New Zealand’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector was released today by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams.

The ICT Report makes a number of findings about the New Zealand ICT sector including:

- the rising investment in the sector
- the sector’s strong employment growth, with wages and salaries twice the New Zealand average
- four times as many ICT firms are investing in R&D than the average for all sectors
- the rapidly increasing exports of computer and information services
- the increasing demand for ICT skills across the economy.

“This report showcases New Zealand’s performance in the ICT sector, which contributes 5 per cent of the country’s GDP. It focuses particularly on Information Technology services, which have achieved export growth of 10 per cent per annum since 2002,” Mr Joyce says.

“The report also notes the 60 specific initiatives the Government is implementing under its Business Growth Agenda to help ICT businesses and exporters expand internationally,” Mr Joyce says.

“Government initiatives include the establishment of Callaghan Innovation, improvements to business R&D grants and expanded co-funding, the roll out of ultra-fast broadband to 75 per cent of New Zealanders by 2019, and our increased investment in science and engineering places at our tertiary institutions.

“A big issue for ICT companies is attracting enough highly-skilled graduates. Latest figures from the TEC show that the number of EFTS places at degree level in New Zealand has grown by 22 per cent over the last two years, and the number of degree graduates with IT specialties is predicted to increase from 1200 in 2011 to between 1600 and 1900 annually by 2014. That sort of growth will need to continue in the years ahead.”

Ms Adams says the report shows that ICT is driving innovation and change in the structure of the New Zealand economy – particularly in jobs, skills and growth.

“Digital technologies are revolutionising business in every area, and some outstanding New Zealand companies are leading the way,” Ms Adams says.

The ICT Report is the first in a series of seven Government reports that also includes high-technology manufacturing, construction, petroleum and minerals, tourism, knowledge-intensive services, and an overall report on all the sectors. Together they make up the New Zealand Sectors Report 2013.

“These reports by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment provide detailed information about each sector and will be valuable for informing the debate about our economic future,” Mr Joyce says.

“They show the change that is occurring in the New Zealand’s economy with the emergence of sectors like information technology alongside our traditional export sectors of food and beverage, forestry and tourism.”
