Small Business Minister John Banks today congratulated the 51 entrants of the ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition who have made it through to Stage 2.

“To those 51 entrants, well done – you’ve proven innovation is alive and well in New Zealand,” Mr Banks said.  

“To those who didn’t make the cut this year, don’t be put off.  Perseverance is just as important in getting a business off the ground as having a good idea in the first place. 

“Your business plan could just be waiting for its potential to be unlocked.  If you’re not sure how to do that, seek out expert advice to take your ideas further.” 

The ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition is the most prominent competition of its type in New Zealand. It was launched by Business.govt.nz in 2011 and since then has become a regular fixture in the country’s business calendar. 

This year the competition attracted more than 600 entries from across the country. 

“The high number and evident quality of entries was very encouraging, because it displayed Kiwi innovation at its best,” Mr Banks said. 

“We’re always talking about business confidence, but if you want evidence of that you need look no further than the ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition. 

“Business.govt.nz has proven with this competition that entrepreneurial thinking is part of our culture. We’re a country of small business owners with innovative ideas – a fact which shines through from the level and quality of entries to the competition.”

The selected finalists must now enter more detailed versions of their business plans to be considered for selection for Stage 3.  This will see 17 regional winners whittled down to the top five overall entries, who will then pitch their plans to a panel of expert judges in Wellington in early September.
