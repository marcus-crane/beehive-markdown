Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a $10 million investment in new buildings for 26 schools around New Zealand.

The investment is part of a programme designed to ensure schools have facilities to match their growth.

“This year 26 schools, from small rural to large city schools, will receive additional funding to help them extend libraries, increase administrative facilities, and build new multipurpose spaces," Ms Kaye says.

“This funding recognises the importance of investing in facilities like libraries and administrative areas to support the overall school community.

“The money comes from a fund to increase non-classroom facilities in line with roll growth. It meets the Government’s aims of providing modern environments to increase learning.”

This funding is additional to the schools Five Year Agreement allocation which is used to modernise and upgrade existing buildings. New classrooms and gymnasium space are funded through a separate programme to match school roll growth.

This School Property Guide programme has provided funding to approximately 500 schools in the past 13 years. 

“For many of these schools this funding represents a big investment in their facilities. They have experienced significant growth and I am delighted that we are able to provide this funding.  I look forward to visiting some of the schools in the near future,” Ms Kaye says.
