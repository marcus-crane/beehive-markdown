Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the beginning of trials for the use of x-ray images to screen airline baggage before it arrives in New Zealand.

The trials are a world-first and involve the transfer of aviation security x-ray images from Melbourne Airport to Auckland for passengers on Air New Zealand flights, while the passenger is on the flight. Passengers will still be subject to clearance requirements prior to boarding the plane.

“This technology will allow biosecurity staff to assess the x-ray images before the plane touches down. Any bag containing biosecurity risk items will then be matched with the passenger, who will face further scrutiny by officials upon landing,” says Mr Guy.

If the trials are successful, MPI would look to extend the system to other major Australian airports.

In the longer term, x-ray image transfer could be applied to routes with higher biosecurity risk to New Zealand, such as those from South East Asia, parts of Europe and the Pacific.

“New Zealand is leading the game here. A number of countries, airport companies and airlines are keen to see if this technology provides biosecurity benefits.

“MPI currently will continue to use surveys, declaration forms, detector dogs, x-ray screening, and random physical searches to monitor biosecurity risk among air passengers.

“The system could provide another powerful tool for MPI to protect New Zealand from dangerous pests and disease,” says Mr Guy.
