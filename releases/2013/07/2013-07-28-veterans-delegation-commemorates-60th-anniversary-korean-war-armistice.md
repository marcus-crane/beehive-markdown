Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse today joins Prime Minister John Key and 30 veterans at a New Zealand ceremony in Busan, Korea, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice.

Mr Woodhouse said the ceremony was a fitting recognition of the veterans’ service.

“It is an incredibly moving and emotional experience for our veterans and I am honoured to join them here in Korea to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Whether serving on land or sea, New Zealanders made a huge contribution to the Korean War and today we remember those who fought and died there in service to their country.

“Today’s ceremony recognises the service and sacrifice of those who fell in Korea, as well as those who remain today.

“For many of our veterans, this is their first trip back to Korea since serving here all those years ago.

“It is a privilege for me to stand alongside our veterans of the Korean War and pay tribute to them, and to their comrades who fought bravely for New Zealand.”

While in Korea, the delegation have also attended ceremonies held at the Republic of Korea National Cemetery, Seoul, an Anzac commemorative service held at the Kapyong Memorial, and a combined Service of Remembrance in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery Busan.
