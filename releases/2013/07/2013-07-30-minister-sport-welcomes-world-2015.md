Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully says the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match schedule announced today is an excellent result for New Zealand.

“Given this is a co-hosted event with Australia, I am delighted with the quality of fixtures allocated to New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.

Christchurch’s Hagley Oval has been provisionally awarded the opening match and New Zealand-based opening festivities.

“This gives Christchurch a target to work toward, and signals its re-emergence as a strong tourist and sporting destination capable of hosting world-class events,” Mr McCully says.

At today’s official launch in Wellington, Cup organisers announced New Zealand will host half of all pool matches, including Black Caps versus Australia at Eden Park, one quarter-final, and a semi-final.

The New Zealand Government is contributing $5 million to the tournament through the Major Events Development Fund.

“This commitment will ensure the 2015 Cricket World Cup lives up to the high standards New Zealand set as a host nation during the Rugby World Cup in 2011,” Mr McCully says.

“Given the success of the 1992 Cricket World Cup, I am confident New Zealand will rise to the occasion in 2015 and I look forward to another strong performance by the Black Caps on home soil.”
