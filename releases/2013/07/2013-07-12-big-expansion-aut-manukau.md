Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the Tertiary Education Commission’s decision to support Auckland University of Technology’s (AUT) Manukau Campus expansion.

The expansion, which will see the number of Equivalent Full Time Students (EFTS) at AUT increase from the current 940 EFTS to 4,100 EFTS by 2020, will play a key role in providing greater tertiary education options in the south Auckland region.

“South Auckland is home to one of New Zealand’s fastest growing and most youthful populations. As the region’s population grows, so too does demand for greater access to tertiary education, and at higher levels,” Mr Joyce says.

“With this expansion, AUT will be able to provide more degree-level programmes, and of a wider range than is currently available locally in South Auckland.

“One of the Government’s tertiary education priorities is lifting the achievement of Māori and Pasifika. AUT’s Manukau campus is a proven success in raising participation for these students in tertiary education.

“I commend AUT for all it has done already to increase the opportunities for Manukau’s young people and in particular its Māori and Pasifika community. This expansion is the next crucial step towards increasing student places to meet demand and helping students achieve at the highest levels.

“The tertiary education sector is a key driver of New Zealand’s innovation, productivity and growth. The expansion of the Manukau Campus will help us meet the demand for an innovative and skilled workforce. It fits well alongside the developments of MIT, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa and private sector providers in the area.”

The expansion is Stage 2 of AUT’s Manukau campus development. The campus originally opened in 2010.
