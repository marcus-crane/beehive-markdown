Prime Minister John Key has praised the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) for the 10 years of security and stability it has provided.

Mr Key is visiting Honiara today along with other Pacific Island leaders to attend RAMSI anniversary events, and to mark the transition of the mission from a military and police taskforce to a police-only mission.

“This transition is a clear indication of the progress made. New Zealand is proud to have been one of 15 countries working alongside the Solomon Islands Government in a coordinated, Pacific-wide response,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand has been a significant contributor to RAMSI. Our Police, New Zealand Defence Force, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Inland Revenue and other personnel have made a lasting contribution to Solomon Islands.”

RAMSI was formed in 2003 at the request of the Solomon Islands Government after a period of civil disorder. Significant progress has been made in the past 10 years.

“The military component of the Combined Task Force is withdrawing. A Participating Police Force will stay to aid the Solomon Islands Government in the training and capacity building of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, who will continue to maintain law and order,” says Mr Key.

To mark the anniversary, Mr Key also announced the people of New Zealand have gifted a children’s playground to the Solomon Islands.

“This gift appropriately looks towards the future of Solomon Islands – the younger generation who will lead this nation in the years to come,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key and the New Zealand delegation return to New Zealand this evening, ahead of the Prime Minister’s departure tomorrow morning (25 July) to join a group of 30 New Zealand veterans in the Republic of Korea for the commemorations marking the 60th Anniversary of the Korean War Armistice.
