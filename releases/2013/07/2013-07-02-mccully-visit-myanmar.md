Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Myanmar tomorrow for bilateral meetings and to assess aid requirements in the state of Rakhine.

Mr McCully will depart from Brunei, where he is attending the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ Meeting.

“Myanmar’s Rakhine state has been the scene of communal tensions over the last 12 months and New Zealand has already provided $1 million to the UN World Food Programme’s emergency appeal,” Mr McCully says.

“This visit is an opportunity to see the humanitarian conditions first-hand and discuss how we can provide meaningful support.”

Mr McCully will meet Myanmar President U Thein Sein, Lower House of Parliament Speaker U Shwe Mann, Foreign Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin and Opposition Leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

“New Zealand is committed to developing a mature bilateral relationship with Myanmar following the start of the reform process.”
