Education Minister Hekia Parata has today released information which shows how children are getting on at different stages of the education system in 16 regions throughout New Zealand.

The information shows what percentage of children are participating in early childhood education, are achieving at the National Standards or Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori, and achieving NCEA Level 2.

“This information provides valuable insight into how our education system is performing in different regions throughout the country.   It is powerful for both identifying and providing support,’’ says Ms Parata.

“Education success requires everyone in a young person’s life to be actively involved.  That’s why we have broken this information down so parents, communities, schools, councils, and local businesses can see how the education system is performing in their region and think about ways they can help lift achievement.

“Ensuring each and every child gets a good education is the most important thing our Government can do to raise living standards and create a more productive and competitive economy. That’s why we have set Better Public Service Targets at Early Childhood and Secondary School level.

“We want to see 98 per cent of all school entrants having participated in ECE in 2016, and 85 per cent of all 18 years olds having achieved NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification in 2017. The information released today shows parents and communities how their region is tracking towards those targets.’’
