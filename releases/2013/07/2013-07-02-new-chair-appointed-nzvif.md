Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Murray Gribben of Wellington as the new Chair of New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Ltd (NZVIF).

Current director, Anne Blackburn, has been appointed as the new Deputy Chair.

The new appointments are in response to the retirements of the current Chair, Sir John Anderson, and Deputy Chair Brian Mayo-Smith.

“I’d like to thank both Sir John, who was appointed in 2008, and Mr Mayo-Smith, who was appointed in 2006, for their substantial contributions to the progress of NZVIF,” Mr Joyce says.

“They have provided significant expertise across banking, investment, venture capital and private equity and their strong leadership has assisted NZVIF in achieving its primary aim of enhancing the New Zealand venture capital market.

“New Chair, Murray Gribben, brings with him a large amount of investment banking, property and private equity experience and a good eye for great investments. It is these skills that make him a fantastic appointment to the board.

“Current director, Anne Blackburn, has served as a NZVIF director for five years and that experience will enable her to provide valuable support as Deputy Chair.

“I’m confident that the Board has a balanced set of skills and sufficient experience that will allow the company to operate without disruption during this time of transition.”
