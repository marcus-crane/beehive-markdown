Major changes to the way courts operate from today will make them work better for people, by reducing unnecessary delay and allowing modern technology to be used, says Courts Minister Chester Borrows.

The changes, part of the Criminal Procedure Act, which passed with near unanimous support in Parliament in 2011, represent the largest overhaul of criminal procedure in 50 years.

It puts the onus on prosecution and defence to resolve more outside the court, which alongside other changes will lead to quicker resolution of cases, shorter hearings and fewer wasted appearances in court.

“Having been involved with courts in a number of roles for more than 30 years, I’ve seen the effect that unnecessary delay has on people waiting for justice. The Act will benefit people who are involved in the criminal justice system through no fault of their own, such as victims and witnesses, while maintaining defendants’ rights to a fair trial.”

The changes are expected to reduce the average time it takes to resolve a court case by six to nine weeks, result in at least 350 fewer jury trials a year, and eliminate more than 30,000 unnecessary court events each year – equating to about 10,000 sitting hours.

The Criminal Procedure Act also removes the legal requirement for everything to be done on paper and means courts can make use of modern technology. The Electronic Operating Model has been developed in response and in its first phase will enable Police to electronically file charges direct to courts.

“Today at 1am the courts successfully received the first electronic charges filed by Police meaning that from now on officers will no longer have to hand deliver the 200,000 paper charges they file at courts each year.

“This is great for the justice sector and means Police can spend less time in courts and more out on the frontline.

“These changes are all part of the Government’s efforts to modernise courts and improve the services they provide the public.”
