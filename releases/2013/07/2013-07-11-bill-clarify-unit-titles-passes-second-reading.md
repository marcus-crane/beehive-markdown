Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed the second reading of a bill to clarify and simplify some parts of the law around bodies corporate and unit owners.

“The Unit Titles Amendment Bill makes a number of amendments to the Act that will benefit prospective buyers, unit owners and bodies corporate. It affects about 100,000 people today but the growth of apartment living is likely to cover half a million people within 50 years,” Dr Smith says.

“This bill will reduce costs for prospective buyers needing to access body corporate documents as part of the sale and purchase process. It will enable buyers to select only those documents they require rather than receiving a stack of standardised documents that just adds cost.

“The bill also includes a fast and effective way to recover unpaid levies for body corporates. These issues will now be able to be dealt with by the Tenancy Tribunal.”

The bill was previously part of the Statutes Amendment Bill but was separated out as a stand-alone bill on the recommendation of the Government Administration Committee.

“This bill is part of the Government’s work programme to make the Unit Titles Act function better. It is important, as cities like Auckland shift to more intensive living, that we have effective property law for unit titles that gives home owners certainty about their obligations and rights.”
