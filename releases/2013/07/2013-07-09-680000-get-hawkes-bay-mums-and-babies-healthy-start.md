The Government is investing an extra $680,000 to help give more young families in the Hawke’s Bay a healthy start.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says Hawke’s Bay mothers-to-be who need it will get personalised nutrition advice and exercise coaching while they are pregnant.

“And their babies will benefit from the greater support planned for young mothers with breastfeeding and what first foods to introduce to their babies,” Mr Ryall says.

“Hawke’s Bay DHB and Sport Hawke’s Bay are also boosting their B4 School Check/Active Families programme where children identified as overweight are referred to Sport Hawke’s Bay, with their families, for exercise programmes and advice on how to eat better.

The $680,000 (inc. GST) announced is initially over two years and the project will be fully evaluated for potential further roll out. Funding is from within the Ministry of Health’s existing budget.

Mr Ryall says this is one in a number of announcements the Government plans about new investments in giving families a healthy start.

“We know poor nutrition and lack of exercise in a child’s life plays a major role in the later development of heart disease, diabetes and obesity. That’s why we are investing with a stronger focus on earlier interventions,” Mr Ryall says.

The Government continues to invest around $60 million a year across a range of initiatives in the areas of nutrition and physical activity including KiwiSport, Green Prescriptions and the Fruit In Schools programme for low-decile schools.
