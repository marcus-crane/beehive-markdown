Evan Williams of Auckland has been appointed Chair of the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Mr Williams was appointed to the Te Papa Board in November 2011, and has been Deputy Chair since August 2012.

He is a former Chairman of the law firm Chapman Tripp. He chaired the Technical Advisory Group on co-management of the Waikato River leading to the Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims (Waikato-River) Settlement Act and has had long term involvements with iwi on cultural, heritage and land issues.

For over 20 years Mr Williams has advised the New Zealand government, companies and international banks on capital markets, security and governance in New Zealand.

“Evan Williams has already made a substantial contribution to the Te Papa Board, and his international experience at the highest levels in commercial law, communication, negotiation, financing and corporate governance will continue to contribute to Te Papa’s development”, Mr Finlayson said.

Mr Williams succeeds Sir Wira Gardiner who, as Chairman since 2010, has successfully led the Museum through a period of significant change, including the setting of a new direction for Te Papa, and a restructuring of the institution that will secure its leading international position into the future.

“I thank Sir Wira for his excellent service to Te Papa,” Mr Finlayson said. “He has been heavily involved at a time of significant change. As Chair he has overseen the appointment of a new chief executive and subsequent development of a new long term strategic plan for Te Papa and changes to the organisational structure.”

Mr Williams’ term of appointment is until 30 June 2016.
