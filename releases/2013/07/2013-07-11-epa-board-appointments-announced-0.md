Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced a new appointment and two reappointments to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Board.

“I am pleased to announce that Andrew von Dadelszen has been appointed to the EPA Board. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience that will be extremely beneficial,” Ms Adams says.

“Mr von Dadelszen has held diverse governance and leadership roles in the private and public sector, and has more than 30 years’ business experience.

“He was a councillor for Bay of Plenty Regional Council for six years, chairing the Transport Committee. Mr von Dadelszen has also worked in the not-for-profit sector, including with Local Government New Zealand, Federated Farmers, the Lotteries Community Facilities Fund and the UK-based charity Advisory Committee on the Protection of the Sea.”

Ms Adams is also reappointing two of the current Board members – Tim Lusk and Gillian Wratt.

“Both Mr Lusk and Ms Wratt have made considerable contributions to the governance of the EPA and I look forward to continuing working with them.

"I would also like to take the opportunity to thank David Faulkner and Graham Pinnell, who have stood down from their roles with the Board.

“The EPA has gained significantly from their experience and I am grateful for their valuable contribution.”
