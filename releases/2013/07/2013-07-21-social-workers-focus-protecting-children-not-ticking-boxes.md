Despite notifications to Child, Youth and Family more than doubling in the past six years, social worker response times continue to improve, with 98.7 per cent of critical notifications being attended to within 24 hours.

“As has been repeatedly explained to the Labour spokesperson, the cases she refers to were not instances where children were left in danger, but where cases were not recorded in the system in a timely manner,” says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“Social workers may be occasionally guilty of not ticking the right box at the right time, but they put children first and do the best they can in what are often very complex and challenging circumstances.”

“Since 2008 this Government has increased Child, Youth and Family’s budget by 15 per cent, while many government agencies faced cuts,” Mrs Bennett said.

“Just this morning I announced an extra 55 Social Workers in Schools will begin work by the end of the next school term, bringing the total number to 149 across the country.”

“This is in addition to the 96 new frontline Child, Youth and Family staff already at work.”

There are also now social workers active in every DHB in the country thanks to the Social Workers in Hospitals initiative, introduced by this Government in 2009.

“There are a number of challenges in better protecting our vulnerable children, and they need us to work together for them,” Mrs Bennett said.

“Instead of playing politics, Ms Ardern could answer the letter I wrote to her two months ago where I offered to work in a cross party manner and asked her to work with me on solutions to tackling the issues vulnerable children face.”

“She has ignored my request, choosing instead to put down the fantastic and hugely difficult social workers do every day.”

“Our vulnerable children deserve more from politicians, especially opposition spokespeople on children."
