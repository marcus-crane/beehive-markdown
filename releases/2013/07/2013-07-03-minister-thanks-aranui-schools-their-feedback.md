Education Minister Hekia Parata has thanked the five Aranui schools in greater Christchurch for providing feedback on the interim decision announced in May.

"I would like to thank the Aranui school communities for engaging in the consultation process, and for the effort each school put into their feedback. I will read and consider all of the information provided carefully before making my final decision,’’ Ms Parata says.

The interim decision is that:

- A Year 1-13 Campus should be built on the current Aranui High School site.
- Four schools – Aranui High School, Aranui Primary, Avondale Primary and Wainoni Primary – should close in January 2017.
- Chisnallwood Intermediate should remain open, and continue to operate as normal on its current site, with a review in 2020, once all other changes have bedded in.

Following the announcement of the interim decision, schools were given six weeks to provide any additional information or feedback.

“I have offered all the schools the opportunity to discuss their feedback with me, and am looking forward to meeting with Aranui Primary, Aranui High School, Avondale Primary and Wainoni Primary tomorrow.

“The Government is investing $1 billion into renewing and restoring Christchurch’s education sector over the next ten years. At the end of this process, greater Christchurch will have one of the best and most modern schooling networks in the country.’’

The final decision for the Aranui schools will be announced in September.

***Notes***

Of the 215 schools in greater Christchurch, 177 schools, or more than 80 per cent, are not affected by the Government’s proposals.

Of the 38 schools covered in the original proposals announced in September last year, 28 schools have final decisions.

Two schools (Hammersley Park and Le Bons Bay) have already closed voluntarily.

Three schools in New Brighton (North New Brighton, Central New Brighton and Freeville) are now subject to two new proposals, which are being consulted on together. Those schools have until 10 July 2013 to provide feedback on these proposals.

Five Aranui schools have an interim decision, and a final decision will be announced in September.
