Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the publication of a Director’s Guideline for Public Information Management.

“The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) has completely rewritten its information about public information management to include lessons identified from the Christchurch earthquake response and to allow for advancements in digital technology,” Ms Kaye says.

“This is another step towards completing the post-Christchurch earthquake Corrective Action Plan.

“I am pleased to see consideration of the rapid advancements in technology to increase our preparedness for civil defence emergencies.

“Public information management is about how civil defence organisations communicate with the public about what is happening and what actions to take. It is crucial we do that well.

“We know that the organisation leading a response must be able to provide an authoritative voice to give the public confidence about the response and advise what people should and should not do.

“If the lead agency does not do that, then others will fill the information vacuum with potentially confusing information that can hinder the response and endanger people. This is a particular risk with social media, so it is important that emergency managers have access to all the channels people use to find critical information.”

The published Director’s Guideline for Public Information Management provides consistent advice for all local authorities, the 16 regional Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Groups and the Ministry to use to plan for, respond to, and recover from emergencies.

**Questions and answers**

**Q:     How does the new guideline and the plan tie in with overall capability for preparedness?**

A:     Public information management is about how civil defence organisations communicate with the public. It is crucial we do that well.

The organisation leading a response must be able to provide an authoritative voice to give the public confidence about the response and advise what people should and should not do.

This guideline gives an overview of public information management and includes information that organisations can copy and adapt for their own planning before an emergency and to use during a response.

The guideline is also the basis for the two-day public information management course the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) runs twice a year. The course is for local authority staff who will be providing public information during an emergency.

**Q:     What lessons from the Christchurch response have been included in the new guideline?**

A:     The structure used to organise the public information management team in Christchurch has been included as an example for a large scale response. Other points include:

- the importance of public leaders, who are different people from the managers of the response, was clearly shown
- the demand for a constant flow of information, available through as many channels as possible, including online and social media
- having plans, templates and other information copied and backed up in different places and different ways.

**Q:     How does the new guideline make the most of advances in digital technology?**

A:     Since the guidelines were first published in 2007 there has been great change in digital technology. In particular, the rapid development of online information and news sources, and people’s ability and expectation to access that information pretty well anywhere, anytime.

The previous version made little reference even to using websites and none at all to social media. The 2013 version emphasises that, today, these are key channels that must be used.

**Q:     What response do we expect from local authorities (and regional CDEM groups?) to the new guideline?**

A:     It gives organisations an overview of public information management and they will be able to copy and adapt information to use for their own planning and during response to an emergency.

The guideline is also the basis for the two-day public information management course the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) runs twice a year.

The course is for local authority staff who will be providing public information during an emergency.
