Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain today announced the reappointment of the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Board.

“The reappointment of the Board in its entirety - Kenneth Raureti, Robyn Bargh, Tupara Morrison, Deryck Shaw and Henri Burkhardt (Chair) – is recognition of the excellent work that the Board is doing,” says Mr Tremain.

The Institute is a statutory body established in 1963 to promote and foster Maori arts and crafts and to develop the Whakarewarewa thermal reserve in Rotorua, on which its business operates.

“In recent years the Board has increased its investment in and commitment to promoting Maori arts, crafts and culture through a number of bone and greenstone carving schools. It has also supported a wide range of initiatives, including the successful Waka Tapu voyage to Easter Island,” says Mr Tremain.

“Ownership of the Institute is in the process of being transferred to iwi (Ngati Whakaue and Tuhorangi Ngati Wahiao). The reappointments will allow for governance continuity, and will avoid disruption to the business while the ownership transfer process is under way.”
