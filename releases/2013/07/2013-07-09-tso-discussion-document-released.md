Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today released a discussion document on possible changes to the Telecommunications Service Obligations (TSO).

The TSO regulatory framework established under the Telecommunications Act 2001 provides for basic telecommunications services to be available and affordable. Under the Act, a review of the TSO is required to take place before the end of 2013.

Ms Adams says the telecommunications market has changed dramatically since the TSO was introduced in 2001.

“Improved competition and well-targeted supply side initiatives like the Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband programmes mean most consumers now have a wider choice of providers and services.

“Given the changing telecommunication scene, I am now seeking public feedback on the extent to which the TSO should be modernised and reshaped to meet the current environment and likely future changes in the sector.”

Four broad options are outlined in the discussion document for future TSO provisions. This includes the status quo remaining, as well as three options for change – minimal, medium and significant.

The full discussion document and a summary version are available on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment website at: [www.med.govt.nz/tsoreview](http://www.med.govt.nz/tsoreview).

Submissions close at 5pm on Tuesday 20 August 2013.
