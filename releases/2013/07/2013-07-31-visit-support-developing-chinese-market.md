Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse has arrived in China to meet with business and government leaders, and visit Immigration New Zealand offices.

Mr Woodhouse’s trip coincides with the latest release of figures showing that more than 220,000 Chinese visitors came to New Zealand in the six months ending 30 June 2013- more than any country apart from Australia.

“China is a country that continues to grow in terms of its importance to New Zealand’s tourism and international education sectors,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Inbound tourism is one of our most important industries and is worth around $9 billion a year. Increasing the number of visitors and migrants from new markets such as China is a key priority to growing the economy.”

Mr Woodhouse says much of the growth in Chinese visitor numbers can be attributed to the China Southern Airlines commencing daily direct flights to New Zealand in April 2011.

“It also shows that the work being done across Government to grow the Chinese visitor market – such as Immigration New Zealand’s visa facilitation scheme with China Southern Airlines – is really paying off.

“Our Immigration offices in Beijing and Shanghai play a significant role in attracting and facilitating Chinese visitors to New Zealand so it is important for me to take the opportunity while over this side of the world to visit the offices in action and ensure everything is running smoothly.”

During his four-day trip Mr Woodhouse will also attend high-level meetings with senior Chinese ministers and officials and visit one of China’s top education consultancy businesses.

Mr Woodhouse’s visit to China follows on the back of his trip to Korea, where he led an official delegation of 30 New Zealand veterans to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice.
