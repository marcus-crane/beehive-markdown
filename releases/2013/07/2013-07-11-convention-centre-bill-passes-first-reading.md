Legislation to give effect to the agreement to build a $402 million international-standard convention centre in Auckland today passed its first reading in Parliament.

“The New Zealand International Convention Centre Bill is about investment, jobs and growth,” Mr Joyce says.

“This Bill gives effect to the agreement signed last week between the Government and SkyCity to build a world-class convention centre in Auckland that will be a major asset for New Zealand.

“The Convention Centre will generate significant spin-off benefits including a projected $90 million annual injection into the economy; an estimated 1000 jobs during construction; and 800 jobs once it is up and running.

“For years the tourism industry and business sector have been seeking an international-sized convention centre to be built in New Zealand to ensure we compete with Australia and Asia by tapping into the growing market of high-value business visitors.

“This Bill is further evidence the Government is delivering on its plan to build a more competitive and productive economy that creates jobs, lifts incomes, and boosts the standard of living for Kiwi families.

“Parties in favour of jobs for New Zealanders are supporting the Bill. Parties that don’t care about jobs for New Zealanders are opposing it.

“The National-led Government’s changes to the RMA, the Employment Relations Act, and the Crown Minerals Act and legislation on Ultra-Fast Broadband, the EEZ and Callaghan Innovation, have all been about creating jobs and building growth in this country while minimising social impacts. The New Zealand International Convention Centre Bill is just the latest example.”
