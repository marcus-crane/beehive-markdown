Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the Government will seek to have an audit of recent building consents issued by Christchurch City Council to ensure they’re up to the required standards.

It follows concerns raised by International Accreditation New Zealand, which will revoke the council’s building consent accreditation next Monday.

IANZ says it has identified issues with technical processing that means building consents might not meet the requirements of the Building Code.

“The potential for there to be sub-standard buildings as a result of a less than adequate consenting process is a huge worry to the Government.

“This is something we must move on quickly so that the people of Christchurch can rebuild their city with confidence,” Mr Brownlee says.

Christchurch City Council will meet tomorrow to vote on a resolution to invite the Local Government Minister, Chris Tremain, to install a Crown Manager to oversee the council’s consenting function.

“If this resolution is passed, it would be my expectation that one of the first tasks would be to commence an audit, including technical review, of consents issued,” Chris Tremain says.

A specialist team from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, which has been working at the council in recent weeks, will remain in place.

Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says if additional resources are required they will be provided.

“Officials have advised me that initial assessments have shown that it’s highly unlikely any recently consented buildings would have to be demolished, but we will need to check to be sure.

“It’s paramount we sort this situation out and ensure Christchurch City Council regains its accreditation,” Mr Williamson says.
