Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain is pleased that the Gambling (Gambling Harm Reduction) Amendment Bill has passed its second reading in Parliament tonight.

“This Bill is the first step in a wide-ranging series of reforms to the class 4 gambling sector, and should not be considered in isolation,” says Mr Tremain.

“The Government is already doing a lot to address gambling-related harm. This includes a three-year, $55.3 million gambling harm strategy focused on prevention, education, awareness and dedicated services for problem gamblers.

“This Bill goes further to address problem gambling. The original Bill only said that harm minimisation devices “may” be introduced through gaming societies’ licence conditions. The Select Committee’s improvements to the Bill enable the Government to introduce sensible new technologies on a mandatory basis, nationwide, rather than through each individual licence.

“Regulations will also be more flexible as new technology develops. I am keeping a watching brief on the different technologies that are emerging, including facial recognition software and player tracking systems.

“The Bill will also give councils more tools to enable the transfer of gaming venues out of low socioeconomic neighbourhoods and into other areas such as CBDs. This will enable councils to further reduce the number of gaming venues in the areas where they are causing the most harm.

“The Select Committee has made further changes to the Bill with respect to local distribution of gaming proceeds. The Government supports the idea of a minimum percentage of proceeds being returned to the area where they were raised. I intend to progress regulations to this effect soon after the passage of this Bill.”
