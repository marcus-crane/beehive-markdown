Measures to protect New Zealanders while also making trade and travel easier were agreed at a Ministerial meeting that concluded in United States today, Justice Minister Judith Collins says.

Ms Collins attended the meeting alongside her ministerial counterparts from Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.

“Building on long-standing, successful cooperation between our countries, we explored ways our nations can continue to work together on law enforcement and security issues that will help keep New Zealanders safe,” Ms Collins says.

Ministers discussed increased collaboration within existing legislative, privacy and security frameworks – including how to combat the growing incidence of cyber-crime and violent extremism to further enhance lawful trade and travel.

“The rapid growth in international travel and online trade and communication means crime knows no boundaries and is increasingly crossing national borders,” Ms Collins says.

“Working cooperatively means our nations will not only protect our citizens but also increase the benefits that flow from growing legitimate trade, tourism and immigration.”

Ms Collins says New Zealand brought to the meeting our experience in areas of law enforcement where we are leading, such as the sharing of criminal history information for employment vetting purposes.

Ministers agreed on the value of maintaining a multinational approach to border and law enforcement management and will continue to work together to strengthen existing bilateral arrangements.
