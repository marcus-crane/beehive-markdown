Associate Minister Jo Goodhew has congratulated 16 health professionals who have won scholarships to take part in the Health Quality & Safety Commission’s improvement advisor professional development programme.

“This is the first time the improvement advisor programme has been held in New Zealand, and it reflects this Government’s commitment to investing and building capability in DHBs,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“This programme will create a network of skilled and experienced improvement advisors who will be able to lead improvement projects regionally and nationally.”

The $272,000, 10-month programme teaches participants to lead quality improvement projects in their DHBs. Participants commit to spending at least one day a week completing course work and supporting improvement projects, including the Commission’s *Open for better care* national patient safety campaign.

Two of the scholarship winners will launch new projects to reduce harm from falls. Sarah Harris, Clinical Nurse Specialist for Infection Prevention and Control at Hutt Valley DHB, will work on a project to reduce harm from falls in aged residential care. Kaye Cameron, Nurse Coordinator Quality and Risk at South Canterbury DHB, will work to reduce the number of falls causing harm at Timaru Hospital’s assessment, treatment and rehabilitation ward.

“I congratulate all the scholarship recipients and look forward to receiving reports from the Commission on their progress and achievements,” Mrs Goodhew said.
