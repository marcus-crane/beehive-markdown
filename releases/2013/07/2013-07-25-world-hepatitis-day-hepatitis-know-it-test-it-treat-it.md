Ahead Of World Hepatitis Day on Sunday 28 July, Health Minister Tony Ryall is encouraging New Zealanders with hepatitis to enrol in free support programmes to help them live longer and healthier lives.

“The Hepatitis Foundation of New Zealand offers programmes to support people with hepatitis B and C to better manage their condition,” says Mr Ryall.

“There are two national programmes available – one for hepatitis B and one for hepatitis C. The hepatitis B programme is the largest of its kind in the world, with 14,000 New Zealanders receiving care and support.

“At the beginning of the year, the Foundation, with $5 million from this government, launched a new integrated community assessment and support programme for people infected with hepatitis C.

“The programme is being piloted in the Bay of Plenty, Wairarapa, Hutt Valley and Wellington and aims to reduce the number of people dying prematurely of liver cancer from this potentially curable disease.

“Nearly 600 people are enrolled in the community programme. The community hepatitis nurse in the Bay of Plenty, Ann Hornell, tells me it is making a real difference to the lives of people with hepatitis C,” says Mr Ryall.

“Since the clinic moved into the community, more people are coming for check-ups and a lot more people are considering treatment. People tell me the community clinics are more convenient and less intimidating than having to go to the hospital,” says Mrs Hornell.

“Previously patients required a liver biopsy to check the condition of their liver. This was often a painful procedure and people had to spend at least half a day in hospital and take time off work.

“We now use a FibroScan which quickly and painlessly checks the stage of their disease. We are able to discuss the results there and then and talk about their treatment options.

“Since the pilot started we have identified 61 people with cirrhosis and 28 with severe fibrosis. These people had no idea they had these conditions which increase their risk of developing of liver cancer or liver failure. We have referred them to hospital specialists for active monitoring and care,” says Mrs Hornell.

In New Zealand, there are around 150,000 people living with chronic hepatitis B or C – 100,000 with hepatitis B and 50,000 with hepatitis C.
