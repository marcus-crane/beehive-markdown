Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the announcement by US Secretary of State John Kerry that agreement has been reached on a basis for direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

“New Zealand strongly supports the efforts of US Secretary of State John Kerry to move the peace process forward through direct negotiations on a two-state solution," Mr McCully says.

“I have assured Secretary Kerry of New Zealand’s support for his initiative on a number of occasions, and emphasised this support in meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas during my visits to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory last month.

“My discussions in the region have confirmed that both sides have a mutual interest in pursuing progress. New Zealand urges both sides to use this opportunity to make meaningful and lasting progress towards a sustainable two-state solution.

"I also understand the reasons why Secretary Kerry intends to keep the elements of today's agreement private. This will best allow the process to move forward.

"We place on record our strong support for Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas and the constructive and responsible leadership that has made today's announcement possible."
