Justice Minister Judith Collins will travel to the United States today to attend a ministerial meeting with her counterparts from Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Ms Collins says the meeting builds on a long history of cooperation between the countries on issues of law enforcement and security.

“Globally we are more connected, with greater international travel and online trade and business,” Ms Collins says.

“On the meeting agenda will be ways that our countries can work together to reduce the proliferation of cyber-crime, such as the sexual abuse of children online, identity theft and online fraud.

“By addressing these issues we not only protect our citizens but create opportunities to increase the benefits that growing legitimate trade, tourism and immigration offer.”

Ms Collins says increased cooperation between nations on issues of law enforcement and security will help keep New Zealanders safe from international and transnational crime.
