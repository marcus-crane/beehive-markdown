Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the reports on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Periods 6, 7 and 8 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 6, which was paid on the morning of 12 June, paid 89,061 people a total of $173.96 million.

The report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.30 per cent of staff across the country, 21 staff were notified as not paid, 109 were overpaid, and 140 underpaid. Affected staff were from 197 schools or 8.0 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 7, which was paid on the morning of 26 June, paid 89,557 people a total of $175.62 million.

Complaints and notifications, in regards to that pay period, were received regarding 0.26 per cent of staff across the country, 17 staff were notified as not paid, 89 were overpaid, and 128 underpaid. Affected staff were from 177 schools or 7.22 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 8, which was paid on the morning of 10 July, paid 89,971 people a total of $175.82 million.

Complaints and notifications, in regards to that pay period, were received regarding 0.22 per cent of staff across the country, 13 staff were notified as not paid, 91 were overpaid, and 97 underpaid. Affected staff were from 156 schools or 6.36 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“The payroll system is continuing to perform better, with eight out of the last nine pay rounds being within the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review team,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is pleasing to see given Pay Period 8 was the largest payroll so far this financial year and had the smallest number of issues of the 12 pay periods that have been monitored since February.”
