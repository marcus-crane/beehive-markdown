The Treasury’s Statement on the Long-Term Fiscal Position today confirms the Government’s careful fiscal management will keep debt under control and help the country prepare for an ageing population, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“The Government’s fiscal strategy of firm expenditure control, combined with efficiency savings by using existing spending more effectively is clearly working,” he says. “We have taken time to understand the main drivers of spending and acted responsibly to get them under control, while at the same time delivering better public services for New Zealanders.

“The Government’s two fiscal goals of returning to surplus in 2014/15 and reducing net core Crown debt to no higher than 20 per cent of GDP by 2020 will make a significant and positive difference to the Government’s accounts in the 2020s and beyond.

“The Long-Term Fiscal Statement says early action in controlling government spending and debt is crucial. That’s what the Government has focused on. It also confirms the longer the Government sticks to its current fiscal strategy, the more the fiscal position in the 2020s and beyond improves.

“By taking action early, we are ensuring New Zealanders continue to receive the public services they require, which is important as the population ages and requires extra resources in areas such as superannuation, healthcare and disability services. It also leaves us well placed to handle future shocks.”

The Long-Term Fiscal Statement shows the longer the current fiscal strategy is followed, the more the fiscal position in the 2020s and beyond will improve – particularly with respect to significantly lower debt.

“As the Treasury notes, a prudent medium-term fiscal strategy will give governments wider choices about how to address cost pressures as they emerge and investing in priority public services,” Mr English says.
