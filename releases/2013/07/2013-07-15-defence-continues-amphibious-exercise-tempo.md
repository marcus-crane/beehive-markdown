Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says New Zealand is continuing to strengthen practical cooperation with its international partners as we develop our amphibious capabilities.

“At last year’s annual Australia-New Zealand Defence Ministers meeting we agreed to further develop our practical cooperation,” Dr Coleman says.

“The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) is sending observers to Exercise Talisman Saber 2013, one of Australia’s major biennial exercises, to further develop our amphibious capability.

“This is a key exercise involving Australia and the US, and New Zealand is embedding observers this year with the possibility of participating fully in the future. It is important for our people to exercise with our partners in large scale complex exercises like Talisman Saber to improve our interoperability.

“We are continuing to engage more with the US following the Wellington and Washington Declarations. Last year the NZDF took part in Exercise RIMPAC, and we recently contributed personnel to Exercise Dawn Blitz, which was a good opportunity for our people to test their amphibious skills.”

The NZDF is embedding 12 observers in Exercise Talisman Saber 2013. Approximately 28,000 personnel will take part in the biennial Australian and US training exercise which tests combined and joint war fighting capabilities in a complex high-end environment. It will be conducted in Australia and Hawaii from 15 July to 5 August 2013.
