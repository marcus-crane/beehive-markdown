The Government has today announced it will continue funding for Computers in Homes for the next financial year.

Education Minister Hekia Parata says this is possible through moving up to $1.6 million of funding from Vote Education to the Department of Internal Affairs for the purposes of digital literacy.

“Computers in Homes connects families and communities with education and technology that’s why there are three of us making this announcement today,’’ Ms Parata says.

“These connections are powerful in boosting the educational achievement of our children.’’

Ms Kaye says Computers in Homes delivers major benefits to families in low income communities and enables them to connect with and participate in the digital world.

“The programme is teaching skills and providing access to digital technologies to enable more families to be able to participate fully in education, training and employment,” Ms Kaye says.

“Research shows that when parents acquire these skills, they can better support their children’s learning. This additional funding will benefit another 1500 families and their wider communities.

“The Government recognises the importance of digital literacy. That’s why we have invested $1.35 billion in the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative to ensure that by the end of 2019, 75 per cent of the population will have access to ultra-fast broadband,’’ Ms Kaye says.

“The Rural Broadband Initiative will enable the remaining 25 per cent of New Zealanders to get access to faster broadband.”

“I am very pleased that with the support of my colleagues we are now able to fund Computers in Homes to continue their current level of service in the coming year,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“I was honoured to attend a Computers in Homes graduation in Auckland last week, where I saw first-hand the high value our communities place on this programme. I congratulate Laurence Millar and his team on all their achievements and look forward to continuing to work with them,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Computers in Homes, run by the not-for-profit 2020 Communications Trust, began as a pilot project in 2000. Since then it has delivered major benefits to thousands of families in low income communities and enabled them to connect with and participate in the digital world.
