The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Ngāti Haua at Rukumoana Marae, near Morrinsville today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

The Crown was represented at the ceremony by Mr Finlayson, who signed on behalf of the Crown, Member of Parliament  for Waikato, Lindsay Tisch, who witnessed the signing, and Hauraki-Waikato Member of Parliament, Nanaia Mahuta.

“The actions of the Crown after 1840 caused enduring harm to Ngāti Haua and today they are virtually landless,” Mr Finlayson said. “It is not possible to fully compensate for the wrongs of the past. This settlement forges a new relationship between the Crown and Ngāti Haua. It will also bring economic benefits to Ngāti Haua and the wider community.

Ngāti Haua will receive $13 million of financial redress and the return of culturally significant sites such as the mountain Maungakawa, located within Te Tapui Scenic Reserve. There will be no change to public access.

The settlement acknowledges and recognises the importance of Te Kauwhanganui o Mahuta which is dedicated to the establishment of Te Kauwhanganui (the Māori Parliament). A relationship agreement between Ngāti Hauā, Department of Internal Affairs and Te Papa Tongarewa with respect to Te Kauwhanganui o Mahuta was also signed today.

“The government is committed to resolving all historical treaty grievances in a just, durable and timely way,” Mr Finlayson said. “We are now well over half way through completing all historical Treaty claims and are focussed on maintaining this momentum. This settlement is good for the iwi, for the region, and for all New Zealanders.”

The Ngati Haua settlement addresses the non- raupatu historical claims of Ngāti Haua not settled under the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995. 

The deed will now be implemented through legislation.
