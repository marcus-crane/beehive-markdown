Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board Chris Tremain today announced $30 million dollars has been allocated to the Lottery Boards Significant Projects Fund.

“This is a fund that delivers real benefits to New Zealand communities. Thirty million dollars is a considerable commitment and I am confident this funding will make a big difference across the country, enabling large and important community projects to be completed,” says Mr Tremain.

The Significant Projects Fund has previously supported a number of iconic projects across New Zealand:

- Auckland Zoo Charitable Trust received a grant of $2,694,000 to develop Te Wao Nui; a unique set of habitats allowing visitors to explore the animals, plants and culture of New Zealand
- The Carter Observatory Trust in Wellington received a grant of $698,412 towards a major refurbishment project to provide an improved educational facility.
- The Methven Heritage Association received $1,901,594 towards the redevelopment of Mount Hutt Memorial Hall to create an interactive exhibition of snow-sports history and culture, and an agricultural education centre named ‘New Zealand’s Alpine and Agriculture Encounter’
- Ngai Tahu Māori Rock Art Charitable Trust near Timaru received $594,852 towards the Māori Rock Art Centre.
- A grant of $6 million was awarded to enable the construction of the Q Theatre in Auckland.

The Significant Projects Fund will be open to accept applications in late 2013 and it is anticipated that funding decisions will be made towards the middle of 2014.  Information on the fund will be made available on [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
