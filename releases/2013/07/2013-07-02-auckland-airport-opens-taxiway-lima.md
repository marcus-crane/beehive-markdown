Associate Tourism Minister, Chris Tremain today attended the opening of Auckland Airport’s new taxiway, an investment in infrastructure that doubles the capacity of aircraft to access part of the international terminal building.

“The Government recognises the importance of investment in long term infrastructure developments like this project. Taxiway Lima will reduce aircraft congestion, reduce delays and improve the safety of aircraft in low visibility,” says Mr Tremain.

“As an island nation, air connectivity is crucial to many of New Zealand’s industries, especially our tourism sector. International tourism is our second biggest export earner, contributing 15.4 per cent of New Zealand’s total export earnings and directly employing 6.2 per cent of our total workforce. The government recognises its value and is investing more in this industry.

“Auckland Airport is a strong tourism partner that is working collaboratively and strategically with other key tourism players including the Tourism Industry Association, Tourism New Zealand, and Air New Zealand.

“This new taxiway is the kind of behind-the-scenes investment that is needed in order to provide better services to everyone, increase the airport’s value to New Zealand and enable economic growth.”
