A new approach to helping sole parents and other beneficiaries move into work, is making a difference says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

Work and Income has been trialling the new approach in 24 locations around New Zealand and have helped 6,000 people off welfare, including nearly 800 on DPB related benefits and around 5,000 Unemployment Beneficiaries.

“I’ve always said this Government was determined to help more people off welfare into work with better support and we’re doing it.”

The Work Focused Case Management approach simply provides more intensive and one-on-one support for those at risk of long-term benefit dependence.

“Both Work and Income case managers and beneficiaries have said the new approach is positive, flexible and focused on taking real concerted action to help people into work,” says Mrs Bennett.

Welfare reforms which came into effect last October included changes:

- Ensuring sole parents with children five and older are available for and supported into part-time work.
- Ensuring sole parents with children 14 and older are available for and supported into full-time work.
- Requiring sole parents who have another child while on a benefit to be available for work after one year, in line with unpaid parental leave.

Since the changes came into effect more than 9,000 sole parents around New Zealand went off benefit into work.

“The Investment Approach which comes into effect from July 15 this year, will provide even greater flexibility in how we work with people on benefit.”

“For example, external providers can use the funding they receive to address barriers to employment like transportation, which can make a big difference.”

Providers working with sole parents will get incentive payments when they find beneficiaries work and when that job has lasted six months and a year.

Work and Income will continue to help people into work and provide support.

The Ministry of Social Development currently provides:

- $50 million a year for before/after school care for over five year olds.
- $150 million a year for Childcare Subsidy payments.

“We also announced a further $80 million to cover Early Childhood Education costs for teen parents through the Youth Services changes in Budget 2012.”

When the next tranche of welfare reforms come into effect from July 15 this year, there will be around 84,000 beneficiaries on the new Sole Parent Support.

About 16,000 sole parents with children aged fourteen or older who will be included in Jobseeker Support. Currently there are around 100,000 sole parents on the DPB.

The new changes this month will also include social obligations requiring all beneficiary parents ensure their children:

- Attend 15 hours a week Early Childhood Education (ECE) from age 3.
- Attend school from age five or six.
- Enrol with a General Practitioner.
- Complete core WellChild/Tamariki Ora checks.

“All of these changes will make a real difference with more parents supported into work and more children receiving vital services,” says Mrs Bennett.
