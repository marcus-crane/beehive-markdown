NZ on Screen, a website funded by NZ On Air has had more than 1 million visits in the last year, a thirty per cent increase on 2012, Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss announced today.

“More and more Kiwis are choosing to watch New Zealand television and film, and to listen to Kiwi music online. More than 1 million visits to the NZ on Screen website shows that New Zealanders watch and listen to Kiwi content on a range of platforms. These websites increase the availability of content,” says Mr Foss.

“Kiwi content is becoming more accessible thanks to the emergence of digital platforms and the availability of websites promoting home-grown talent. These three websites allow Kiwi content to reach not only a local audience, but also an international one,” says Mr Foss.

“Last month, NZ On Air announced it would continue funding three innovative NZ websites, NZ On Screen, Audio Culture and theaudience. It’s great to see so many Kiwis choosing to explore these innovative sites, and to see a continued commitment to funding from NZ On Air.

“We’re committed to supporting content that tells New Zealand stories through NZ On Air’s contestable funding processes. This promotes competition and ensures the best possible content is produced at the right price and reaches the widest possible audience,” says Mr Foss.

Audioculture was launched on 31 May 2013 and has had 78,808 page views.

In the year to 31 June, NZ On Screen received 1,200,000 visits and 2,900,000 page views.
