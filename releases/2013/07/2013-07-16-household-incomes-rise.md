Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the Ministry of Social Development’s Household Incomes Report for the 2011 calendar year.

“This provides a candid snapshot of how New Zealanders were doing financially in 2011,” says Mrs Bennett.

The report shows incomes increased as New Zealand recovered from the Global Financial Crisis and work increased on the Christchurch rebuild.

The 2013 Household Incomes Report shows the median household income rose 2.3 per cent in the 2011 calendar year, compared to a fall of 3 per cent the year before. 

“This report is the first to cover the beginning of the economic recovery and along with the rise in incomes also reveals inequality flattened out following the economic volatility of recent years,” Mrs Bennett said.

“New Zealand income earners in the top decile were actually hardest hit during 2011 with an 8 per cent fall in income, while all other deciles experienced a rise.” 

Most OECD countries, including Australia, the UK and the US, saw net falls in income during this period, particularly in lower income households.

The income inequality trend-line is flat, and there is no evidence of any general rise or fall in income inequality since 2007.

Child poverty remains a serious issue, and although all standard measures show rates have been flat since 2009, 25 per cent of children live in homes with no full-time worker.

“We know children living in benefit dependent homes have higher poverty rates than those in working families and we’re implementing comprehensive reforms to the welfare system to address that.”

“The reforms provide better support, including one-on-one case management for jobseekers and childcare assistance for teen parents,” Mrs Bennett said.

In this year’s Budget the Government also announced a package of initiatives designed to better support low income families, with targeted investment including:

- $100 million for the Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes programme, targeting low income households.
- $188.6 extra for the next stage of welfare reforms, with more intensive, work focused support for beneficiaries.
- $21 million over the next four years for rheumatic fever treatment and prevention.
- $9.5 million over five years, matched by Fonterra and Sanitarium, for the Kickstart Breakfast programme beginning with low decile schools.

Housing New Zealand is also spending a record $2.9 billion over three years including adding 3,000 bedrooms to state houses, 500 new infill homes in Auckland and insulating every state house capable of being insulated by the end of the year.

“Despite the bleak picture Opposition MPs like to paint, New Zealand has come through the recession better than most other countries,” says Mrs Bennett.

‘I do not deny some are doing it harder than others and that’s why the Government continues to target assistance and support to those most in need.”
