More young New Zealanders are succeeding in education with further progress towards achieving the Government’s Better Public Service \[BPS] results targets.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata say the Government’s drive for greater NCEA success is showing strong results that are making a real difference for young people.

**Result 5: Increase the proportion of 18-year-olds with NCEA Level 2 or equivalent qualification**

- **Target:** 85 per cent of 18-year-olds will have achieved NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification in 2017.

“Data for the 2012 year shows that 77.2 per cent of 18-year-olds achieved NCEA Level 2 in 2012, compared with 74.3 per cent in 2011. This is an increase of 2.9 percentage points, and exceeds the target set for 2012 of 76.1 per cent,’’ says Ms Parata.

“This means over 1,800 more 18-year-olds achieved NCEA Level 2 in 2012, which is a great result, but we must continue to do better.”

**Result 6: Increase proportion of 25-34 year olds with NZQF Level 4 or above**

- **Target:** 55 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds will have a qualification at level 4 or above by 2017.

In 2012, 52.6 per cent 25 to 34-year-olds had higher qualifications (New Zealand Qualifications Framework Level 4 and above), up from 51.8 per cent in 2011.

“This means over 8,100 more 25- to 34-year-olds gained qualifications at Level 4 of above last year than in the previous year. Additionally, 34 per cent of 22 year-olds had completed a qualification at Level 4 and above in 2012, compared with 32 per cent in 2011,” Mr Joyce says.

“The results for Māori and Pasifika students are also encouraging, with increases in the number of students with Level 4 qualifications and above. In 2012, 26 per cent of Pasifika 22-year-olds had completed a qualification at Level 4 and above, up from 22 per cent in 2011. Māori completion rates in 2012 were up from 20 per cent in 2011 to 22 per cent.”

In 2012, there were also 10,174 students enrolled in Trades Academies, Service Academies and fees free places through the Government’s Youth Guarantee.

The Government has introduced a wide range of initiatives that have helped to achieve these results.

“In the tertiary sector, we have introduced changes to improve industry training, introduced the New Zealand Apprenticeships scheme and increased support for Māori and Pasifika trades training. Extra flexibility was also introduced for high performing private training establishments so that more young people are encouraged to engage in qualifications,” Mr Joyce says.

“We are making steady progress towards our targets, which is pleasing to see. Qualifications at this level and above mean greater productivity for our economy and better jobs and higher wages for New Zealanders and their families.”

“At secondary school level, the Government has invested heavily in professional development for teachers, with a particular focus on increasing Māori and Pasifika success,’’ says Ms Parata.

“We have also worked with schools to identify students who are at risk of not achieving NCEA Level 2 and put in place practical support to help them. We will continue to work together to get every student across the line.”
