Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of former Court of Appeal Judge Hon Sir Bruce Robertson as chair of the Sports Tribunal of New Zealand.

“Sir Bruce’s judicial expertise and previous Tribunal experience as deputy chair will serve him well in this new role,” Mr McCully says.

Sir Bruce also has considerable experience in sport administration, particularly in rugby. He will be supported by newly appointed deputy chair James Farmer QC and reappointed deputy chair Alan Galbraith QC.

“As a prominent court and tribunal lawyer with experience on the Air New Zealand board, Mr Farmer brings an excellent set of skills to the deputy role,” Mr McCully says.

Former New Zealand cycling coach Ron Cheatley and ex-Black Fern Anna Richards have also been reappointed as Tribunal members.

“My thanks to outgoing Tribunal chair Hon Barry Paterson for his years of dedication as head of New Zealand’s leading sports mediation body,” Mr McCully says.
