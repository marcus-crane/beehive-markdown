Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today officially opened eight new affordable social housing units in Nelson, which will be rented to low and middle income families with high housing needs.

“Nelson’s housing costs are putting real pressure on lower income families and these new homes are affordable, good quality and centrally located. This initiative will make for eight happier, healthier and more secure families,” Dr Smith says.

“The total cost of the project is $2.2 million and will deliver six three-bedroom houses and two two-bedroom houses for families in need. It is the first phase of the Nelson Tasman Housing Trust’s social housing development at St Lawrence Street and has been made possible by a $1 million grant from the Government’s $139 million Social Housing Fund.

“These homes will be rented to families at 80 per cent market rents and targeted at those who do not qualify for a state house but have difficulty finding a private rental. The trust will help the families maintain their tenancy by drawing on their extensive community network.

“These new houses are of high quality. They’re warm and dry and include energy efficient features such as solar water heating and heat pumps.”

Dr Smith says the second phase of the social housing development, for a further two four-bedroom houses and two three-bedroom houses, is due to begin next month. The second phase has been granted $513,000 of capital funding from the Government’s Social Housing Fund.

“This initiative is part of the Government’s housing reforms to make homes more affordable and to expand the provision of community social housing. We believe community housing can deliver better social benefits than just expanding the state housing estate. Our ambition is to grow the community social housing sector to provide 20 per cent of social housing in the long term.

“The major national debate on housing is focused on Auckland and Christchurch and that is where the bulk of the Government’s new investment is going. However, we also have regions like Queenstown, Tauranga and Nelson that have affordability issues in which the Government needs to provide support.

“I am very proud as local MP of the innovation and commitment of the Nelson Tasman Housing Trust that is a model for my broader nationwide reforms. This project is a tribute to their years of hard work and is a credit to all involved.”
