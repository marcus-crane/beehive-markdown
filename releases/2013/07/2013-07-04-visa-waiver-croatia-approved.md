Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today announced Croatians will no longer need a visa to travel to New Zealand for a short visit.

Mrs Bennett made the announcement while in Croatia advancing discussions on a Social Security Agreement between New Zealand and Croatia.

“The visa waiver will make it easier for business visitors to come to New Zealand which will help further develop trade ties,” says Mrs Bennett.

“It will also mean a lot to Croatians visiting their Kiwi-Croatian relatives.”

Croatians will be able to visit for a period of up to three months visa-free.

“This agreement recognises the growing relationship as well as the historic links between our two countries.”

“We have a strong and vibrant Croatian community in New Zealand, and an increasingly important trade relationship with Croatia.”

The relationship has been further strengthened through Croatia joining the European Union as its 28th member on 1 July this year.

“The visa waiver will come into force in early July. Currently around 240 Croatians visit New Zealand a year but tourism is expected to grow with the visa waiver in place,” says Mrs Bennett.

There are around 100,000 Croatian descendants in New Zealand.

New Zealand visitors already enjoy visa free access to Croatia.
