Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says the response to the recent Cook Strait earthquakes on Sunday demonstrate the high calibre of civil defence staff and the importance of being prepared.

“This morning I met with Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown and senior members of the Wellington Regional Emergency Management Office team (WREMO),” Ms Kaye says.

“I have also spoken to Marlborough Mayor Alistair Sowman**,** and met with John Hamilton, Director of MCDEM, and Dr Kelvin Berryman, Director of the Natural Hazards Research Platform this morning.

“We discussed the science around the Cook Strait earthquakes. It’s important to understand that earthquake science is based on probabilities and the unexpected can happen. That is why it is important for all of us to continue to be prepared.

“Dr Berryman has informed us that the pattern of aftershocks appears to be aligned with previous geological activity in the region. Since the 6.5 magnitude earthquake on Sunday in the Cook Strait, he confirmed he believes that a standard aftershock sequence is occurring.

“The Natural Hazards Research Platform will continue to coordinate information flow and monitor activity in the Cook Strait area, and is keeping MCDEM informed,” Ms Kaye says.

“I appreciate this event would have been unnerving and frightening for many people in Marlborough, Wellington and the wider region. At times like this, it’s important that people look out for their loved ones and neighbours and continue to support each other.

“The indications I have had are that both the Wellington and Marlborough regions are now moving from response to clean-up and business as usual. I want to acknowledge the leadership and effort of all those involved in the response.

“This event is a timely reminder for all New Zealanders to continue to be prepared. People can get more information about being prepared for an emergency at [www.getthru.govt.nz](http://www.getthru.govt.nz),” Ms Kaye says.
