Broadcasting Minister, Craig Foss and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata are today announcing the appointments of Dr Lesieli MacIntyre and Taualeo’o Stephen Stehlin to the board of the National Pacific Radio Trust (NPRT).

Dr MacIntyre was a senior lecturer in Pasifika education at the Massey University College of Education. She has researched and written extensively on Pasifika education issues and is currently a senior adviser to Pacific Island students at the University.

Taualeo’o Stephen Stehlin is an experienced broadcaster, is a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to Pacific Island television broadcasting and the arts. He is a Council member of the Auckland University of Technology and is producer of TVNZ's flagship Pacific Islands show Tagata Pasifika.

The appointments are until 30 June 2016.

“This is great news for Pacific broadcasting. These appointments will complement the great work the Trust is already doing and will continue to move that work forward,” says Ms Parata.

“We would also like to thank and acknowledge the considerable service given by retiring board members, Brian Chamberlin and Dr James Prescott who have held office since January 2007,” says Mr Foss.
