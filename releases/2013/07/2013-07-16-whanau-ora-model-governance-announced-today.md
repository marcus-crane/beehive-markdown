The Minister for Whanau Ora Tariana Turia is delighted to announce the model for the future delivery of Whanau Ora in Wellington today. The Minister met with the Whanau Ora Governance Group, Regional Leadership Groups and Provider Collectives at the Wharewaka on the Wellington waterfront.

“The Government has now considered recommendations on the best model to ensure the delivery of Whanau Ora which will see significant changes to the future scope and direction of Whanau Ora,” says Mrs Turia.

“A key milestone in the Relationship Accord between the National Government and the Maori Party was to improve the reach, capability and effectiveness of Whanau Ora. Today marks the successful culmination of that work.”

“The Government will establish a Crown-Iwi Whanau Ora Partnership Group comprising senior ministers, iwi chairs and experts on Whanau Ora.”

“Three Non-Government Organisation (NGOs) commissioning agencies will be established, one based in the North Island, one in the South Island and a Pacific agency. These agencies will be required to have their own regional networks and capabilities to support their commissioning plans and decision-making.”

“This new commissioning model signals the wind down of the Regional Leadership Groups at the end of December. The governance group will also be wound down with its final task being the overseeing of the RFP process for the three NGO commissioning agencies. Te Puni Kokiri will remain the administering department for Whanau Ora at this point.”

“Whanau Ora represents a significant investment in whanau by this Government and I am excited about this new structure.”

“Around the country wherever I go I see whanau who have the capability and collective capacity to overcome the various challenges that confront them and can and will take responsibility if empowered to do so. Whanau Ora is empowering families to be less reliant on state agencies and transforming agencies to become facilitators rather than fixers.”

“I would like to thank the Governance Group in particular the chair Professor Sir Mason Durie who since the inception of Whanau Ora has provided insightful quality advice and has remained dedicated to restoring self determination to our people.”

“To the Regional Leadership Groups and Provider Collectives who have worked tirelessly because they believe in a better future for our people - I thank you all for your commitment and dedication to our whanau,” says Mrs Turia.
