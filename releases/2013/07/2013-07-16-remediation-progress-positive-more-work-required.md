Positive progress has been made in resolving outstanding issues with Novopay under the Remediation Plan - but the system is not out of the woods yet, Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce says.

The Remediation Plan was established in February this year with Cabinet agreeing to put aside up to $5 million to help deliver stable pay periods, clear the backlog of outstanding pay issues through the Backlog Clearance Unit (BCU), and resolve system bugs and defects.

“Since the Remediation Plan was introduced good progress has been made in three areas: processing of pay; fixing bugs; and clearing the backlog of pay instructions,” Mr Joyce says.

“Pay periods are now stable and are currently performing as expected. At the beginning of February the percentage of people on the school payroll who complained about underpayments, overpayments, and non-payments was 2.2 per cent. Eight out of the last nine pay rounds have been below the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review.

“We have also made progress in fixing bugs. At the end of February there were 613 outstanding bugs of which 60 were classified as Category Two, or ‘very serious’. The Technical Review identified that we should have fewer than 10 Category Two bugs by the end of June and we have achieved that with eight Category Two ones remaining out of a total of around 316 bugs.

“Since the establishment of the BCU in late March, the Education Ministry and Talent2 have also made significant progress by clearing virtually the entire backlog of around 12,000 pay instructions. The Ministry is now in the process of contacting schools to check that their pay instruction issues have been dealt with.”

Mr Joyce says despite improvements to Novopay functions that impact directly on fortnightly pay, there are three other areas that still need significant further work – leave balances, clearing overpayments, and resolving outstanding tax issues.

“Bug and data issues are impacting on the accuracy of leave balances. There are around 4400 people with continuing issues in regards to leave balances that we need to resolve and clear. The Education Ministry and Talent2 are continuing to work on a number of bug fixes in relation to leave balances.

“The backlog of overpayments is taking longer than expected to clear with around 10,000 still remaining. Around 600 overpayments a week are being cleared but our aim is to increase this to more than 1000 a week.

“The third area is to resolve outstanding tax issues in relation to back pay and issues with the wash up of the 2013 tax year as a result of overpayments between September and March. The Education Ministry, Talent2 and the Inland Revenue Department are working together on this.

“The Government is commissioning a further two-month period of remediation with the Education Ministry and Talent2 until 6 September to continue work on these issues. No extra funding is required on top of the $5 million agreed in February.

“There will be bug fixes and some remedial data entry to resolve the leave issues. We will step up efforts to clear the backlog of overpayments, introduce an upgrade to the Novopay software in mid-August to ensure tax on back payments is calculated correctly, and put in place more bug clearances – including those related to the end of year/start of year process.”

Mr Joyce says alongside the remediation work, the Education Ministry is finalising the project to improve the online functionality of Novopay for schools.

“In addition, regional support initiatives are being rolled out, starting in the South Island. Recruiting has begun for a network of Education payroll advisors who will be available to offer expert advice to schools.

“The Ministry and Talent2 are also committed to developing a service delivery model that works for all parties.

“While the Ministry and Talent2 have made significant progress with Novopay over the last five months, further remediation and effort is required to resolve outstanding issues. We are not out of the woods yet – there are a number of things that could still go wrong, and there continues to be issues that need to be solved. Our focus continues to be on ensuring the system performs better for school payroll administrators and staff,” Mr Joyce says.  “We thank staff for their on-going patience.”
