Associate Minister of Finance Jonathan Coleman is representing New Zealand at this week’s Pacific Island Forum Economic Ministers Meeting in Tonga.

“It is an important opportunity to discuss the economic development issues facing the Pacific,” Dr Coleman says.

“The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting is a chance for Finance Ministers to share experiences and develop collective responses to wider issues of economic growth and regional integration.

“It is important that New Zealand contributes to this dialogue, and that we assist with driving forward change. Sustainable economic development is vital to unlocking the Pacific’s potential and developing security and prosperity.

“New Zealand is committed to supporting increased trade, investment and economic opportunities in the Pacific.”

The annual Forum Economic Ministers meeting takes place from 4-5 July 2013 in Tonga. It brings together 15 Economic Ministers and representatives from across the Pacific.

Dr Coleman will also attend His Majesty King Tupou VI birthday celebrations, along with the Royal New Zealand Navy band which is taking part in events. The celebrations also include a tribute to the New Zealand and Australian Defence Forces for their 41 years of Technical Adviser assistance to the Tongan Defence Services.
