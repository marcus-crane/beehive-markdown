Legislation that will give effect to the final agreement to design, build and operate a $402 million international standard convention centre in Auckland has today been introduced to Parliament.

The New Zealand International Convention Centre Bill is to have its First Reading on Thursday. It follows the signing of the final agreement on Friday night between the Government and SkyCity.

The short Bill provides for the specific agreed regulatory concessions under the agreement to be provided to SkyCity, while ensuring that SkyCity must comply with gambling laws and regulations in all other respects in regard to those concessions.

It also establishes protection of the name “New Zealand International Convention Centre” and “NZICC”, and requires that the Convention Centre land cannot be used for any other purpose.

Documents relating to the negotiations have also been released today. This includes the Regulatory Impact Statement, which lays out the opportunities and risks that Cabinet had to consider, as well as Cabinet papers and information on harm minimisation.

Further information in relation to the agreement, negotiations and other matters will be released in the coming weeks.
