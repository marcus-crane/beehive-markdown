Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says a memorandum signed today between Landcorp Farming and Massey University and their Chinese counterparts will further strengthen the close ties between China and New Zealand in the agricultural sector.

The memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Anhui Agricultural University, Anhui Anxin Husbandry Development Limited and Anhui Provincial Government Decision-Making Cultural Exchange Centre provides collaboration on sheep farming and pasture growth opportunities in Anhui province.

Landcorp will provide sheep farming expertise while Massey University will contribute technical consultancy services.

“China has a large flock of sheep raised in low numbers, with the average farm size just half a hectare. While leading this trade mission it has become clear there is a great opportunity for the New Zealand sheep industry in China.

“New Zealand has a great history and expertise in sheep production right through the supply chain. This MOU provides a platform for Landcorp and Massey University to expand the existing relationships they already have in China.

“This is another example of China’s growth in agricultural production creating major opportunities for New Zealand businesses to use their skills and expertise.

“Earlier this year I signed a Strategic Plan on Promoting Agriculture Cooperation agreement with China's Minister of Agriculture, encouraging greater cooperation and sharing of knowledge. The MOU signed today is an example of this in action.”
