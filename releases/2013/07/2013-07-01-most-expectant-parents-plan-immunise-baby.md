The *Growing up in New Zealand* study shows nearly all babies received their six week and three month vaccinations, protecting them from childhood diseases like whooping cough.

*Growing Up in New Zealand* is a longitudinal study that provides an up-to-date picture of what it is like to be a child growing up in New Zealand in the 21st century. 

“Immunisation is one area of the study, including whether or not expectant parents intend to immunise their child and protect them infectious diseases,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Of the 6172 babies, 95 per cent received their six week vaccinations, 94 per cent received their three month vaccinations and 90 per cent received their five month vaccinations by the time they were nine months of age.

“Prior to the birth of their baby, mothers were asked if they planned on immunising their child. 85 per cent of mothers said they intended on immunising their child, 13 per cent were undecided and only 2 per cent were opposed to childhood immunisation.

“The greatest influences on parents when deciding to immunise their child are midwifes, family doctors, family, and books and magazines.

“First born children were more likely than second or subsequent children to receive each of their scheduled vaccinations. The study found first born children were 60 per cent more likely to receive their six week vaccinations.

“Immunisation is one of the most effective interventions to prevent against infectious diseases. New Zealand has gone from one of the lowest immunisation rates in the developed world to one of the best over the past four years – with 89 per cent of eight-month-olds now fully immunised.

“Increased immunisation is a priority for this National-led government and this information has supported our efforts to further increase immunisation rates,” says Mr Ryall.
