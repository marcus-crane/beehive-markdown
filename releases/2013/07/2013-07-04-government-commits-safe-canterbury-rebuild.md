Government Ministers have today signed the Canterbury Rebuild Safety Charter to help keep workers on the rebuild safe.

The Safety Charter, developed by the Canterbury Rebuild Senior Leaders’ Group, has been signed and endorsed by 50 construction, insurance, central and local government leaders.

“Rebuilding Canterbury on time, on budget and safely is a priority for the Government. The Safety Charter is a unique document, bringing industry and government together to make this happen,” says Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

Signatories to the Charter agree to ten actions, creating a consistent and collective approach to health and safety on all rebuild worksites.

“We’re delighted to work in partnership with the rebuild leaders to create what will be an enduring legacy not only for Canterbury but for industry right across New Zealand,” says ACC Minister Judith Collins.

“The cost of construction-related injuries can have a devastating impact on individuals, families and communities. Last year alone ACC paid out $79 million in construction-related claims,” she says.

Labour Minister Simon Bridges praised the rebuild leaders for creating a way of working together for safer, healthier work sites across the Canterbury region.

“If we fail to embed health and safety, we could see one or two people die each year of the rebuild and 600,000 working days lost through workplace illness and injury.

“The Senior Leaders’ Group is a unique partnership that will hold each other to account. It’s committed to preventing corner-cutting or unsafe practices that put lives at risk,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Safety Charter is about everyone taking responsibility for steps that will ensure workers, employees, contractors and subbies get home safely at the end of each working day,” the Ministers say.
