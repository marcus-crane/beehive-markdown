Health Minister Tony Ryall today congratulated health professionals around the country for the progress being made with the national health targets.

“Record numbers of New Zealanders are being assessed for heart disease, diabetes and pre-diabetes, and receiving advice on how they can make healthy changes to their lifestyles,” says Mr Ryall.

“The latest results show 849,000 New Zealanders have had a heart and diabetes check in the past five years.

“This is a great effort and I would like to thank general practice teams for their dedication to improving the health of New Zealanders.

“There has also been continued improvement in the two other preventative health targets – more people are getting help to quit smoking and more parents are immunising their babies.

“In the last year, around 411,000 people who smoke were offered brief help and advice to quit from hospital and general practice doctors or nurses – an internationally recognised health prevention measure.

“And 90 per cent of eight month olds are fully vaccinated, protecting them from childhood diseases like whooping cough and measles.

Mr Ryall also thanked hospital staff for providing more New Zealanders with elective surgery, such as knee replacements and cataract surgery.

“In the past year, 158,000 elective surgeries were delivered by public hospital funding – over 10,000 more than planned.

“New Zealanders continue to receive better health care as a result of the national health targets. The targets are a balance of improving access and better prevention,” says Mr Ryall.
