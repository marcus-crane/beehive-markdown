Labour MP Chris Hipkins is wrong - Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua will be subject to the new child protection policies announced yesterday, Associate Education Minister John Banks said today.

“The Vulnerable Children’s Bill will require all Crown-funded or Crown-contracted organisations who work with children – which includes Partnership Schools - to comply with the vetting and screening requirements of the legislation,” Mr Banks said.

“Under the Education Act 1989, Partnership Schools are subject to the same requirements as state schools with regard to the vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff members.  

 “This is not the first time Mr Hipkins has made false claims about the Partnership School policy – he is wrong when he says teachers won’t be qualified and he can’t even get the name right. 

 “I suggest he spends more time fact checking and less time scaremongering,” Mr Banks said.
