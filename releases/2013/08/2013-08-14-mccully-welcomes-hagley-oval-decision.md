Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully says he is pleased by the decision to proceed with the redevelopment of Hagley Oval as it clears the way for Christchurch to host the opening match and festivities of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.

The Environment Court today granted resource consent for a significant redevelopment of the Oval.

Hagley Oval will host the opening festivities, the opening match between New Zealand and Sri Lanka, as well as matches featuring Pakistan, England and the West Indies.

“The opening match will be a great spectacle and will showcase that Christchurch is up and running as a sporting and tourist destination,” Mr McCully says.
