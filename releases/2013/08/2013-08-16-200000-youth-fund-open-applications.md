Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has today opened the 2014 Youth Fund, with $200,000 available for applications from young people for community projects.

“The Ministry of Youth Development’s Youth Fund is unique in that it supports community projects designed and led by young people (aged 12-24), or by youth organisations in partnership with young people that develop active community participation,” Ms Kaye says.

“Regional panels of young people will assess submitted applications to decided where the funding will go. So this is a completely youth-led initiative.

“Young people from throughout the country have told me they would like the opportunity to make a greater contribution and community projects are a great place to start.

“The more opportunities we can give young people to participate in decision-making and getting involved in service in their communities the better.

“I don’t think we can underestimate the value to our country of investing in young leaders. Particularly through projects where young Kiwis lead the way in solving problems in their communities, or giving other young people opportunities to serve,” Ms Kaye says.

Funding available for each project will be between $2000 and $7000 and applications close at midday on 24 September 2013. The projects need to start from 1 January 2014 and be completed by 30 June 2014.
