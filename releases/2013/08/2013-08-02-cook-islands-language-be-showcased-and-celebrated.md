Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hekia Parata says next week’s Cook Islands Language Week is a great way to help ensure the Cook Islands language lives and grows.

“After the success of last year’s inaugural Cook Islands Language Week I am pleased to welcome the 2013 event and its fitting theme *‘Toku Reo, Utuutu \`la’ – ‘My language, Nurture it’*,” says Ms Parata.

“It is hoped this year’s event will encourage the Cook Islands community to embrace, promote and protect their language for future generations. I encourage all New Zealanders to join in the week-long celebration from August 4-10.”

The Cook Islands population makes up 22 per cent of the Pacific population in New Zealand but only one in six can speak their heritage language, Cook Islands Maori.

The aim of Cook Islands Language Week is to celebrate Cook Islands language and culture and to promote the teaching, learning and use of the language in every environment.

“I congratulate the Cook Islands community on this initiative and for realising the importance of passing on their language to the next generation.

“Cook Island-New Zealanders are proud of their culture and language and I look forward to seeing this showcased in celebrations and events across the country,” says Ms Parata.
