Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today launched the Secondary School Fee Grant Scheme at Alofi O Taoa School on Savai’i, Samoa.

“Removing the burden of school fees from families will give more children access to secondary education, with the chance to gain qualifications and improve their employment opportunities,” Mr McCully says.

The scheme will deliver fee-free education to children in year nine to 11 in government schools, reduced fees for children in mission schools and provide grants to help improve teaching materials.

“New Zealand has committed $5 million to the programme with the aim of increasing secondary school enrolments from about 70 per cent to 85 per cent of all eligible students by 2016,” Mr McCully says.

The scheme builds on the success of the Primary School Fee Grant Scheme, funded by New Zealand and Australia in partnership with Samoa, which helped 159 new students into primary education in its first two years.
