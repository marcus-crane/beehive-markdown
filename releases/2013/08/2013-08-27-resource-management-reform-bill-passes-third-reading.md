A Bill that will provide a six-month time limit on the council processing of medium-sized consents and a streamlined process for Auckland’s first Unitary Plan has passed its third reading in Parliament tonight.

Environment Minister Amy Adams says the Resource Management Reform Bill 2012 is part of a resource management reform package that will see further reforms introduced later this year.

The key features of the 2012 Bill are:A six-month time limit on the council processing of medium-sized consents

- A streamlined process for Auckland’s first Unitary Plan
- A stronger requirement for councils to base their planning decisions on robust cost-benefit analysis
- Consent applications for major regional projects can be directly referred to the Environment Court more easily

“The Government is creating a resource management system that is more certain, less costly, and enables growth, while protecting core environmental standards which are so critical to New Zealand,” Ms Adams says.

“The RMA reforms are about breaking the cycle of delay after delay and delivering decisions that provide certainty for all involved.

“Our reforms are not about growth at any cost.

“I have always said we have to balance our economic opportunities and our environmental responsibilities. That is at the heart of our approach to planning law.”

In addition to the changes outlined in the Resource Management Reform Bill 2012, the Government also intends to introduce a further Bill later this year.

The Bill will propose a number of improvements to the RMA across planning, consenting and the provision of national direction.
