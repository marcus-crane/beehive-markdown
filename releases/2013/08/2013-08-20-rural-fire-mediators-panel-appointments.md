Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has announced the latest members of the Rural Fire Mediators Panel.

The members, appointed for five-year terms, are James Carle, Kerry Ellem, Dennys Guild, Kerry Hilliard, Alan Jackson and Paul Sampson.

“Each panel member has a wealth of senior fire, engineering or forestry experience built up over several decades in their respective sectors. I am sure their skills will be of great value,” says Mr Tremain.

“I would also like to thank the outgoing members, Don Geddes, John Ward and Ralph Turner for their expertise and commitment.”

The Panel is a group of people with expertise in the rural fire or forestry sectors that are available to be appointed, from time to time, as Rural Fire Mediators. Mediators undertake specific investigations, such as identifying the cause of a rural fire or deciding the fire fighting costs to be recovered. Mediators have Commission of Inquiry powers in the course of their work.
