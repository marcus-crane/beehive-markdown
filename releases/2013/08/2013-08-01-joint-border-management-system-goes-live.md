Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the Government’s $89 million Joint Border Management System has been launched.

Importers, exporters, and their agents and brokers, can now submit shipment details electronically to a single point of contact through the JBMS Trade Single Window, rather than dealing separately with several government agencies.

“This reduces the duplication of data to border agencies and will speed up processing times.  Savings will be made by connecting directly to JBMS and doing away with third party transmission charges,” Mr Guy says. 

Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says over the next 10 years JBMS is expected to deliver an estimated $450 million in benefits.

Several pilot partners, responsible for about 60 per cent of all export and import transactions, have played a crucial role in the testing of JBMS. 

“Mondiale Freight for example has already sent and received more than 20,000 entries via the JBMS Trade Single Window.  It has experienced the benefits of faster response times and savings on electronic data transmission costs,” Mr Williamson says.

JBMS will be rolled out in phases, with other elements such a range of risk and intelligence tools, including for food imports.  Existing Customs and MPI electronic border systems will be kept running for 18 months, which will allow the cargo industry to choose when to transfer to the new system.

“The Joint Border Management System will also improve border security by strengthening reporting and cargo reconciliation requirements,” Mr Guy says.
