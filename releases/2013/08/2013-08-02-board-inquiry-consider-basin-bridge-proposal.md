Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced that an application for the Basin Bridge proposal will be decided by an independent Board of Inquiry.

The application by the New Zealand Transport Agency relates to a two-lane, one-way bridge on the northern side of the Basin Reserve that includes a segregated walking and cycling pathway. The proposal is part of the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance.

Ms Adams accepted the Environmental Protection Authority’s recommendation that the proposal was of national significance and should be decided by a Board of Inquiry.

“This process means that people directly affected by the proposal can have their say and the independent Board of Inquiry will deliver its decision within nine months,” Ms Adams says.

“This nine month streamlined process provides certainty for all parties. The Environment Court or relevant local authorities are not subject to this same timeframe.”

The application was nationally significant because of the wide public interest in the project, the significant changes to the local environment that will occur and because of its effect on an area of national significance, primarily the Basin Reserve Historic Area.

The Board of Inquiry will be chaired by retired Environment and District Court Judge Gordon Whiting. The other Board members are resource management consultant Christine Foster, social impact consultant James Baines and planning consultant David Collins.

The Board runs its own process and makes its decision independently of the Environmental Protection Authority and the Minister.
