The Government has released an initial action plan from Doug Martin, the Crown Manager for Christchurch City Council’s building consenting functions.

“The Crown Manager’s terms of reference tasked him with providing an action plan within one month. The plan we have now received provides a comprehensive set of actions which will address issues ranging from systems and processes, to staff culture,” says Local Government Minister Chris Tremain.

“I am pleased that this plan was developed after extensive consultation. In a short space of time Mr Martin has talked to Council staff, the Council executive and key stakeholders and developed a high level of trust. Feedback from staff has been very positive – they accept the need for change and are looking forward to it.

“Since his appointment as Crown Manager, Mr Martin has undertaken more than 60 one-on-one meetings with Council managers and key stakeholders, and 12 workshops with Council staff.”

“The Action Plan includes setting up an audit regime for building consents. We have requested that the Crown Manager include in this a further review of previously issued consents, to ensure there are no historic issues that need to be rectified. This follows two completed reviews by Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment staff,” says Minister for Building and Construction Maurice Williamson.

“The action plan aims for the Council to achieve International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) accreditation by the end of June 2014. This process will not be rushed. The rebuild of Christchurch relies on the Council having thorough and robust systems in place to manage consents, and this will take time,” says Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

“Rather than simply achieve the basics, we would like to see the Council well above the minimum standard for accreditation. The ultimate goal is for the Council not only to achieve IANZ accreditation, but to be an exemplar in the delivery of building consent services.”

The Crown Manager’s term expires on 31 December 2014 unless otherwise advised by the Minister of Local Government.
