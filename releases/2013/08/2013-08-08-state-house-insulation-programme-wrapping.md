Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today visited one of the last state houses in Auckland to be insulated under Housing New Zealand’s nationwide insulation programme.

“This three bedroom house for a family in Flat Bush in Manukau is one of the last to be made warmer and drier through Housing New Zealand’s programme to insulate every state house capable of being insulated by the end of this year,” Dr Smith says.

“Housing New Zealand has so far insulated more than 46,000 state houses, including 10,700 in Auckland since 2009, at a cost of $76 million. They have completed 99 per cent of the insulations and will spend the rest of the year completing assessments to make sure they haven’t missed any properties.

“Insulating state houses has been a priority for this Government because it helps to cut hospital visits, power bills and improve the overall health of tenants.

“Work carried out under the insulation programme includes installing ceiling and underfloor insulation, hot water cylinder wraps, and pipe lagging and stays for windows to ensure properties are adequately ventilated. Housing New Zealand is also installing clean heating solutions to homes as part of a separate programme.”

Houses with flat roofs, concrete floors, limited access between the ground and the floor and multi-storey apartments are unable to be insulated. However, for these properties Housing New Zealand ensures there is adequate heating options available such as solid wood burners, convection heaters, heat pumps, radiant heaters or reticulated gas heaters.
