Health Minister Tony Ryall and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye confirm there have been no reported cases of infant botulism in New Zealand to date.

“There are also no cases where infant botulism looks likely to be the cause,” Mr Ryall says.

“The Ministry of Health has a rapid comprehensive reporting process for paediatric units where a child is admitted to hospital and infant botulism looks likely to be the cause and where other more common conditions have been excluded,” Mr Ryall says.

“But if families have any concerns whatsoever about their infants, they should contact their GP or call Healthline or Plunketline.

“Plunketline and Healthline nurses have answered approximately 11,200 calls since Saturday (3 August),” Mr Ryall says.

The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI)–Food Safety has recalled two infant formula products made from potentially contaminated whey protein.

The recalled products are Nutricia Karicare Stage 1 infant formula (0-6 months) – all batches and Nutricia Karicare Gold+ Stage 2 follow on formula (6-12 months) – all batches.

Ms Kaye says the Government has put a number of resources into public information around the recall of two infant formula products, including online and print advertising, and messages on radio and facebook.

Ministers say they have had several discussions with the food and grocery sector and have been advised people are returning product across 400 retail outlets around New Zealand.

“The Food & Grocery Council is providing regular updates to MPI on domestic supplies of infant formula,” Ms Kaye says.

“The MPI consumer helpline has received more than 1000 calls since Monday (5 August) and its website information page about the potential whey protein contamination of infant formula has received more than 22,500 views since Saturday.

“To ensure the safety messages are accessible there are translations in Māori, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Samoan and Tongan on the MPI website,” Ms Kaye says.
