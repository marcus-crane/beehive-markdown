Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the reports on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Periods 9 and 10 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 9, which was paid on the morning of 24 July, paid 90,392 people a total of $167.69 million.

The report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.12 per cent of staff across the country, 13 staff were notified as not paid, 37 were overpaid, and 58 underpaid. Affected staff were from 76 schools or 3.1 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 10, which was paid on the morning of 7 August, paid 85,705 people a total of $163 million.

Complaints and notifications, in regards to that pay period, were received regarding 0.27 per cent of staff across the country, 19 staff were notified as not paid, 108 were overpaid, and 105 underpaid. Affected staff were from 173 schools or 7.05 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“The payroll system is starting to demonstrate on-going stability with 10 out of the last 11 pay rounds being within the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review team,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is pleasing given Pay Period 9 was the largest payroll so far this financial year and had the smallest number of issues of the 14 pay periods that have been monitored since February.”
