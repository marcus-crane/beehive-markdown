Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse has travelled to Indonesia to attend a major regional conference on people smuggling and trafficking.

The Special Conference on the Irregular Movement of Persons is being held in Jakarta today and will discuss prevention, protection, early detection, and the prosecution of people smugglers in the Asia-Pacific region.

“New Zealand recognises that people smuggling and human trafficking are significant regional problems that require countries to work together to find regional solutions,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“With new legislation passed in June, New Zealand now has measures in place to manage a mass arrival should one occur, and policies that send a clear message to potential people smuggling ventures that New Zealand is not a soft touch.”

During his two day visit Mr Woodhouse will also hold talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Burke, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, and visit the Jakarta office of Immigration New Zealand.
