Police Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Tauranga Police station, and has praised Bay of Plenty Police for their efforts in tackling and preventing crime.

The new building, costing $20.8 million, continues a Police presence on the same site stretching back to 1879.

It will house 160 staff and will also provide facilities for key community partners, such as victim support.

A total of thirteen new Police stations have opened since the start of 2009, with overall building costs of $105.3 million.

“Tauranga deserves this excellent new station, which will meet the modern policing demands of staff and the wider community,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It was delivered on time and on budget, and I want to thank the staff, designers, engineers and contractors for all their hard work.

“It was an honour to open the new building, and to acknowledge, in person, the Police staff who contributed to the 10.8 per cent reduction in crime in the Western Bay of Plenty last year.

“Foot patrols almost doubled in the district last year, and with frontline officers now equipped with smartphones and tablets to input and access data while on the streets, they will be even more visible.

“It’s estimated that the time saved by doing admin work online will mean Police in the Bay of Plenty can devote an extra 42,600 hours each year to crime prevention, or the equivalent of 28 additional staff.

“I wish Police staff and their community partners a safe and successful future in their new surroundings.”
