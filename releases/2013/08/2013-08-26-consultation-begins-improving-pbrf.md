Proposed changes to the Performance-Based Research Fund will save time and reduce compliance costs for researchers and institutions while continuing to reward research excellence, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

The PBRF rewards and encourages excellent tertiary education research by assessing research quality, allocating funding based on results, and publishing information on research performance.  The fund also supports the Government’s wider science and innovation objectives, by supporting research that provides and develops new talent.

The proposal clarifies the objectives of the PBRF and aims to:

- simplify the research assessment process, saving time and reducing costs
- encourage tertiary education organisations to employ and develop new researchers
- reward tertiary education organisations that attract research income from non-government sources and research commercialisation
- strengthen public reporting on research performance.

“The Government wants to build on the success of the current Performance-Based Research Fund to support world-leading research-led teaching and learning for students at degree-level and above. The changes aim to lift and maintain the international competitiveness of New Zealand tertiary education organisations,” Mr Joyce says.

“Government investment in the PBRF is increasing from $250 million to $300 million per year by 2016/17 and it’s important to ensure the fund delivers the best possible value for this investment. I encourage all parties with an interest in tertiary education research and the wider science and innovation system to contribute to this consultation.”
