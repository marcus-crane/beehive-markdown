Health Minister Tony Ryall is encouraging local people to put their names forward for this year’s district health board (DHB) elections and help run organisations bigger than Sky TV and Auckland International Airport.

“DHBs are big operations. Some get over $1 billion a year in revenue – even the smallest DHB has a budget of over $120 million,” says Mr Ryall.

“A quarter of DHBs have revenues greater than a number of the 10 largest domestic companies listed on the NZX, including Sky TV, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland International Airport and Ryman Healthcare.

“Like company directors, DHB board members govern the organisation. They set the overall strategic direction for the DHB and monitor its performance.

“People who have served on DHB boards have found it an interesting and challenging experience that has contributed to their personal and professional development.

“I would encourage anyone who wants to contribute towards better health in their community to think about standing for election,” says Mr Ryall.

Candidate nominations are now open and close at midday on August 16.
