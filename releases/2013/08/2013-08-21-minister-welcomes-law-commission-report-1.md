Commerce Minister Craig Foss welcomed the Law Commission’s report into incorporated societies.

“I would like to thank the Law Commission for its thorough review of the Incorporated Societies Act 1908,” says Mr Foss.

“The legislation is more than a century old, and I thank the Commission for suggesting ways to replace it with a modern Act.

“The Commission has made a series of recommendations to which I will give careful consideration,” says Mr Foss.

The Government will formally respond to the Law Commission’s recommendations by February 2014.
