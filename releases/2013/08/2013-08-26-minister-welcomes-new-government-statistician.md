Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says the appointment of Liz MacPherson as Government Statistician and Statistics New Zealand chief executive will continue a long history of official independent advice for the Government.

Ms MacPherson starts at Statistics New Zealand today following her role as deputy chief executive at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

“Liz has a wealth of experience in using statistics in key areas of government policy like employment, tourism, environment and the economy. That knowledge will be invaluable to her new role.

“There have been four Government Statisticians and a number of acting ones in the 13 years I’ve been the Statistics Minister. All of those have been committed to the need for statistical independence and all have helped the organisation to deliver more of the type of information New Zealand needs.

“Statistics NZ is part way through its 10-year transformation programme and I’m sure Liz will keep up the momentum. I look forward to working with her,” Mr Williamson says.
