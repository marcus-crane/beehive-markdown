Prime Minister John Key will lead the New Zealand delegation, which includes Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully, to the 44th Pacific Islands Forum in the Republic of Marshall Islands next week.

The Marshall Islands has highlighted climate change as a major theme for the leaders of the Forum’s 16 member states to discuss at this year’s meeting in the capital, Majuro.

The leaders will also discuss broader issues, including cooperation and integration around the Pacific Plan, Fiji’s steps towards elections, and security issues.

Mr Key says the Forum is an important event for New Zealand.

“We are a Pacific nation; this is our neighbourhood and we are committed to development and stability right across the Forum nations. This annual event plays a significant role in achieving that.

“I look forward to being in Majuro and engaging with fellow Pacific leaders. New Zealand values the constructive engagement we have with our Pacific partners but like any relationship, success comes from hard work, openness and communication and I think that’s the strength of the Forum,” he says.

As well as attending the Forum meeting and Leaders’ Retreat, the Prime Minister will hold bilateral meetings with other Pacific leaders, and participate in the Post Forum Dialogue.

The New Zealand delegation departs on Tuesday, 3 September, and returns on Saturday, 7 September.
