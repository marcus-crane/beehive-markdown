Associate Health Minister Todd McClay has today written to all local government authorities around New Zealand outlining their powers under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2013 and has called on them to put in place local rules to control further the sale of 'Legal Highs'.

“The government has made significant steps to regulate the legal high market and it is important that local people also have a say on the availability of synthetic drugs in their communities,” says Mr McClay.

“We have deliberately allowed communities the power to decide what areas in their towns and cities these products should not available from and it is important that Councils are fully aware of the powers we have given them in this respect.”

Section 66 of the Act states that territorial authorities may develop policies individually or collectively to control the sale of approved products within their districts. A local approved products policy may restrict the place, number and location of specialist stores.

“This includes local people deciding it is not appropriate for these products to be available near kindergartens, early childhood centres, schools, places of worship, other community facilities and in residential areas. Councils can also decide that shops selling these products cannot be located near each other,” says Mr McClay.

“Over the next few months further regulations will be established by government setting out clear requirements of anybody wanting to distribute and sell psychoactive substances. As this work progresses, it is my expectation that we will see significantly fewer retailers and products available in this market.”

“The Ministry of Health and the Police will be looking to work closely with local authorities to ensure that this new law is fully adhered to,” says Mr McClay.
