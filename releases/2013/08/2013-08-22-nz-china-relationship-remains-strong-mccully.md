Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says his visit to Beijing this week has reaffirmed the strength of the relationship between New Zealand and China.

“While trade and economic issues currently dominate the agenda, my discussions in Beijing have been wide ranging and have emphasised the extent of our shared interests,” Mr McCully says.

“This visit, which was planned some months ago, is timely in light of recent issues involving dairy products from New Zealand.”

Mr McCully today held discussions with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and State Councillor Yang Jiechi.

“Mr Wang and I spoke openly and constructively about issues with some dairy products and the response by Fonterra and government agencies,” Mr McCully says.

“The New Zealand Government has high expectations for New Zealand exports, including the application of strict food safety standards. When issues arise we expect good disclosure and remedial action.

“Both Chinese and New Zealand ministers acknowledge that Fonterra has work to do in the coming weeks to rebuild consumer confidence.

“China is an extremely important trading partner and we are committed to responding to this issue in a timely and cooperative manner.”
