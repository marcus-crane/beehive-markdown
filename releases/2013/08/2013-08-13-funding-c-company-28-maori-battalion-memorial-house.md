The government is pleased to be contributing $500,000 towards the construction of a C Company 28 Māori Battalion Memorial House on land adjacent to the Tairawhiti Museum, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today. 

“This grant has been given to ensure that the immense contribution of C Company members to this nation is recognised and remembered,” Mr Finlayson said. “C Company 28 Māori Battalion has a special place in the history of the region and New Zealand.”

The grant comes on top of funding of $600,000 under the Regional Museums Policy to the Tairawhiti Museum and Art Gallery’s redevelopment and extension project, which is now well underway.

The new funds will be used towards the cost of building the C Company Memorial House. 

The Trust’s concept for the C Company Memorial House is that it will also acknowledge the sacrifice by Horouta Waka District Māori in other theatres of war: The Boer War, the First World War, Korea, Malaya, Borneo, South East Asia and more recent postings such as Bosnia, East Timor, and Afghanistan
