The Primary Sector CEO Bootcamp conference over the last two days has been a major success, says Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

“Over the last two days in Wellington this conference has brought together 35 top agribusiness leaders and five Government agency Chief Executives into one room, representing 80% of all our primary sector exports,” says Mr Guy.

“The Bootcamp initiative started in 2012 and has involved CEOs working together to grow our export earnings and take advantage of major opportunities around the world.

“There is renewed determination to double our primary sector exports to $64 billion by 2025 and establish New Zealand as a premium producer of food and fibre. This is an ambitious but very achievable goal, with the right policies and leadership from both Government and industry.

“It is great to have so many top industry leaders in one room, prepared to collaborate and share expertise for sustainable growth.”

Prime Minister John Key along with Ministers Steven Joyce and Nathan Guy have addressed the group over the last two days, which has also featured update presentations from CEOs and collaborative action planning.

“Recent challenges have reinforced just how important the primary industries are to New Zealand. They remain the powerhouse of our economy, making up around 72% of all our exports and generating around $32 billion a year.”

The inaugural Bootcamp began at Stanford University in 2012, and the success of this has led to an ongoing programme of collaborative actions.
