Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the modernisation of New Zealand’s patents laws as the Patents Bill passes its third reading in Parliament today.

“This Bill is marks a significant step towards driving innovation in New Zealand, it replaces sixty year-old legislation and introduces a patent system suited for the 21st century,” says Mr Foss.

Mr Foss says passing the Patents Bill is an important part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda, which aims to boost innovation and help create a more productive and competitive economy.

“By clarifying the definition of what can be patented, we are giving New Zealand businesses more flexibility to adapt and improve existing inventions, while continuing to protect genuine innovations,” says Mr Foss.

Mr Foss thanked the many people involved in the Bill’s development.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many innovative NZ businesses that have given feedback on the Patents Bill for their engagement. Passing the Patents Bill guarantees that genuine inventions are protected, and Kiwi businesses can continue to innovate and grow,” says Mr Foss.
