Health Minister Tony Ryall and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye have welcomed a voluntary recall by Nutricia of two lines of infant formula that may be contaminated.

“The recalled products are Karicare Stage 1 New Baby Infant Formula (from birth) and Karicare Gold+ Stage 2 Follow-on Formula (from 6 months),” Ms Kaye says.

“We have been advised that Nutricia has voluntarily recalled the products to ensure potentially affected stock is off the shelves until there can be complete confidence as to whether or not these products are contaminated.”

“Ministers spoke with food and grocery industry members this afternoon and they have assured us they have no immediate concerns about ability to supply existing alternative infant formula products,” Mr Ryall says.

“The industry is putting in place arrangements to secure the on-going supply of these other infant formula products,” Mr Ryall says.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is continuing to work around the clock to verify and identify any products that potentially contain the contaminated whey protein,” Ms Kaye says.

“Today, MPI has sent staff to Fonterra’s offices in Auckland and Melbourne to verify Fonterra’s records about where the contaminated whey protein has gone.

“MPI also has a team in Nutricia’s New Zealand warehouses verifying which specific batches of its products may contain contaminated whey protein, and which don’t,” Ms Kaye says.

Mr Ryall said The Ministry of Health is keeping a close eye on the situation and there have been no case notifications of babies or infants with *Clostridium botulinum* in New Zealand.
