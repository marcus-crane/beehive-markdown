Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart tomorrow for Brunei to participate in series of regional trade meetings.

Mr Groser will attend the first Ministerial Meeting for the newly launched Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) FTA negotiations, an ASEAN Economic Ministers meeting, which will focus on the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), as well as attending an East Asia Summit Economic Ministers Meeting, and holding discussions on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

“These meetings provide an opportunity to advance the TPP and RCEP negotiations and to evaluate the progress of existing free trade agreements. As well as negotiating new agreements, the Government is committed to ensuring that New Zealand and its partners fully implement existing FTA commitments so as to make the most of those opportunities.

“Both TPP and RCEP will deepen economic ties by opening up trade in goods and services, boosting investment flows, and promoting closer links across a range of economic policy and regulatory issues.

“New Zealand is working with the other TPP parties to deliver on the commitment reiterated by TPP Leaders in Phnom Penh last year to achieve a comprehensive, high-ambition and 21st century TPP agreement that is consistent with the Honolulu statements endorsed by leaders and ministers in November 2011. The meeting in Brunei will be a critical checkpoint to take stock of progress made and discuss with my counterparts how we can secure an agreement as rapidly as possible,” Mr Groser says.

**Notes:**

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a FTA negotiation that has been developed among 16 countries: the 10 members of ASEAN and the six countries with which ASEAN has existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) – Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will create a regional free trade agreement involving 12 countries: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, the United States, Viet Nam and New Zealand.
