Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced that two new High Tech Youth Network studios will be established in Dunedin South and Penrose in Auckland.

“I am very pleased that the $1.9 million provided in Budget 2013 will enable the High Tech Youth Network to develop these two new studios and to continue to support young people enrolled at existing studios,” Mrs Goodhew said.

The High Tech Youth Network Trust (formerly the Computer Clubhouse Trust) provides free after-school learning environments where young people work with adult volunteer mentors to explore their own ideas, increase their skills and develop belief in their own potential through the use of technology.

“This programme is an excellent example of community groups, government and the private sector working together to improve access to and uptake of digital technology,” said Mrs Goodhew.

There are currently five High Tech Youth Studios located in Otara, West Auckland, Hamilton, Whakatane and Hutt City. A site in Northland is also currently under development.

Young people who attend the studios learn project management and technical skills such as computer game design, electronic publishing, Photoshop, animation, and 3D graphic design. Some sites provide free wireless internet connection to the surrounding community.

“I am excited by the objectives of the High Tech Youth Network Trust because they put young people at the centre and focus totally on helping them to become creative, confident, lifelong learners,” Mrs Goodhew said.
