Health Minister Tony Ryall donned a hard hat today to visit Burwood Hospital’s redevelopment site in Christchurch and hear first-hand what’s next with the record breaking project.

The new state-of–the-art health facility for Canterbury’s older people at Burwood is part of the largest and most complex hospital building project in the history of New Zealand’s public health service along with the redevelopment of Christchurch Hospital, Mr Ryall says.

The three main blocks accommodating up to 230 patients - “Burwood Health Campus” - will rest on special earthquake foundations, and sit amongst extensive landscaping.

“The $650 million plus hospital rebuild is part funded with around $430 million from the Future Investment Fund,” Mr Ryall says.

“The rebuild will go a long way to take the pressure off Canterbury health services and set them back on their feet after the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes,” Mr Ryall says.

This month a new car park, temporary entrance and reception to the Burwood Hospital are being developed. A number of old or earthquake damaged buildings will be demolished to make way for construction of the building platform for the new facilities.

Canterbury District Health Board chair Bruce Matheson said, “We have set a very challenging timeline – with work on the building platform starting next month; the main building work will start in January and the first ward blocks will be open by the end of 2015.”

Construction of Christchurch Hospital is expected to be completed in 2018.
