Prime Minister John Key is welcoming the first bilateral visit to New Zealand by Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill, later this week.

“New Zealand shares a close relationship with our largest Pacific neighbour, which both countries are keen to strengthen,” Mr Key says,

“Papua New Guinea is an important partner in the Pacific and Asia-Pacific region and I look forward to having constructive discussions with Prime Minister O’Neill.”

Both governments are encouraging greater commercial ties with a Double Tax Agreement going through the final stages of ratification.

“There are huge opportunities for New Zealand businesses in Papua New Guinea. The tax agreement will help facilitate trade between both countries”, Mr Key says.

“New Zealand also supports a large Aid programme in Papua New Guinea. We are sharing our expertise in renewable energy and agricultural production and distribution with Papua New Guinea. We are also providing continued support to Bougainville, including a successful community policing project.”

Mr O’Neill’s three day visit will include an official dinner and an official opening of the refurbished Papua New Guinea High Commission premises in Wellington. He arrives on Wednesday.
