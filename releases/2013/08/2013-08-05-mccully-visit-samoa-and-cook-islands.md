Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will visit Samoa and the Cook Islands this week to meet leaders ahead of this year’s Pacific Islands Forum in the Marshall Islands.

“This visit is a chance to hear the views of Samoan leaders, including Prime Minister Tuilaepa, ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum and to take stock of our on-going development assistance programme," Mr McCully says.

Next year Samoa will host the third Small Island Developing States (SIDS) conference, with over 3000 delegates from around the world.

"This important meeting takes place only once a decade and will put the Pacific development agenda in the international spotlight. My discussions with Prime Minister Tuilaepa will look at how New Zealand can best support Samoa as the host," Mr McCully says.

In the Cook Islands, Mr McCully will meet Prime Minister Henry Puna to discuss the Forum, and attend the swearing-in of the new Queen’s Representative, Hon Tom Marsters.

“The visit is also a valuable opportunity to see first-hand the progress being made on New Zealand-funded water, sanitation and energy projects in the Cook Islands,” Mr McCully says.

One of these - Te Mato Vai - is a $60 million partnership between the Cook Islands, New Zealand and China to replace Rarotonga’s ageing water infrastructure and deliver healthy drinking water to all homes and businesses.

“New Zealand is committed to being an active player in the Pacific region and supporting the on-going sustainable development of our closest neighbours,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully left for Samoa last night.
