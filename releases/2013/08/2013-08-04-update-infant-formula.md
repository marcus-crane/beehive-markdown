Health Minister Tony Ryall and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye advise parents and caregivers to follow the updated Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) advice on potentially contaminated infant formula in New Zealand stores.

Ms Kaye says updated information on affected products can be found here: [http://www.mpi.govt.nz/food/food-safety/whey-protein-contamination](http://www.mpi.govt.nz/food/food-safety/whey-protein-contamination)

“If people have any health concerns they should call Healthline on 0800 611 116 or Plunketline on 0800 933 922 for advice,” Mr Ryall says.

“The Ministry of Health is keeping a close eye on the situation and have advised us that they have received no case notifications of babies or infants with *Clostridium botulinum* in New Zealand.”

“MPI has received information overnight that has extended the range of products that are potentially contaminated. Nutricia has issued a precautionary recall of some Karicare infant formula. The products and batch numbers are available on MPI’s website,” Ms Kaye says.

“We encourage people to regularly check this website link for updates. Our goal is to ensure that people are safe and that the public have the information they need.”

“Officials have advised us that they are working with suppliers to ensure back-up supplies of infant formula are available if required,” Mr Ryall says.

“MPI and Ministry of Health are working together to inform the public about potentially contaminated infant formula products that may be in the hands of New Zealand consumers,” Ms Kaye says.

“There is a formal operational response team of more than 60 people working from MPI, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This team is providing updates to relevant Ministers.

“Ministers are meeting regularly to ensure a whole of Government response and that there are adequate resources to deal with this evolving situation.”

“The Government is taking this very seriously and is doing everything we can to ensure the public receives up-to-date and accurate information particularly regarding the safety of babies and infants,” Mr Ryall says.

“The Acting Director-General has published a statutory statement for the purpose of protecting the public.  He has advised me he expects to update statements as circumstances change and new information comes to hand in order to protect the public,” Ms Kaye says.  

“We will continue to update parents and the community,” Mr Ryall says.
