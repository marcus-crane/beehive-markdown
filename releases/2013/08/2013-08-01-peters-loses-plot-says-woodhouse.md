Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse says the latest tirade from Winston Peters shows the New Zealand First leader is clearly out of touch with reality.

Currently in China meeting with senior government officials, education leaders and Immigration New Zealand (INZ) offices, Mr Woodhouse said suggestions his trip was courtesy of China Southern Airlines were absolutely untrue.

“Mr Peters has absolutely no basis for making this statement and is either deluded or is being deliberately misleading. Either way, serious questions should be asked of him,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Mr Peters continues to claim applications are being stockpiled by INZ which is blatant rubbish, designed to stir the embers of xenophobia for political ends and he should be ashamed of himself.”

Mr Woodhouse says his trip to China has been extremely successful in strengthening ties between the two countries.

“The China market is an important part of New Zealand’s future economic success. It is important that we continue to develop relationships in China that will help strengthen ties and contribute to more jobs and higher wages for New Zealanders.

“I’ve been very impressed with the efficiency and professionalism of our Immigration offices in Beijing and Shanghai and I remain upbeat about the prospects in tourism, trade and education with China.”
