Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says people should be prepared for more aftershocks from the 6.6 magnitude Lake Grassmere earthquake last Friday.

“People should make sure they have a good emergency plan in place for their families, that they have adequate supplies and that they drop, cover and hold during earthquakes,” Ms Kaye says.

“On Friday the National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC) at Parliament was activated to ensure both Marlborough and Wellington Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups were supported through the earthquake and aftershocks. I spoke to both Mayors on Friday and offered any assistance they might need.

“I visited Seddon and the surrounding areas with Earthquake Commission Minister Gerry Brownlee last Saturday and we were joined by local MP Colin King. There is widespread damage but fortunately, mostly limited to roofs, brickwork, chimneys and windows.

“The Marlborough Civil Defence Emergency Management Group did a great job coordinating the response, which has now moved to the recovery phase. And the Fire Service worked hard over the weekend to protect damaged homes from the rain.

“In Wellington the Civil Defence Emergency Management Group has also moved to the recovery phase. They also worked hard during the response which saw most of the city’s workers trying to leave the central business district as quickly as they could.

“Both Marlborough and Wellington had building inspectors deployed over the weekend.

“I am impressed with how effectively and efficiently local authorities have responded to the event. They have been present in their communities providing leadership and instilling confidence in residents.

“Civil Defence National Controller John Hamilton will issue a press release today giving advice on what to do in an earthquake, particularly for those who work in multi-story buildings.”
