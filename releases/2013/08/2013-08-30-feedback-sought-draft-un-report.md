A draft report outlining New Zealand’s torture prevention efforts has been released for public consultation today by Justice Minister Judith Collins.

“This report is a key part of our commitment to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a core international human rights treaty,” Ms Collins says.

“It’s important New Zealand engages with international bodies like the UN Committee Against Torture so that we maintain our reputation as a strong advocate of human rights.”

New Zealand reports to the Committee Against Torture every four years about what it has done to implement the Convention domestically.

The draft report outlines measures the Government has in place to increase support for victims of domestic violence, efforts to address over-representation of Māori in the criminal justice system, and planned law changes related to human trafficking.

The report also notes that there have been no cases of torture in New Zealand during the review period.

The Government is seeking public feedback on its draft report before a final version is confirmed by Cabinet later this year.

“Anyone who is interested can participate in this process, by reading the report and commenting on the issues it covers,” Ms Collins says.

The report is available at [www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/consultation](http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/consultation)

Interested parties can make submissions by email to [humanrights@justice.govt.nz](mailto:humanrights@justice.govt.nz) until 27 September.

The Government will submit the report to the UN by the end of the year.
