The Government has committed funding for a further 19 community projects aimed at reducing bullying amongst young people under a second round of the Te Punanga Haumaru fund, announced Associate Social Development Minister Tariana Turia today.

Te Punanga Haumaru was established in 2012 to provide funding for communities to build community ownership and a commitment to reducing bullying of children and young people by changing attitudes and behaviours and encouraging positive social behaviour. A panel of young people with experience in this area met over two days to consider the 72 applications received.

“The panel were asked to look carefully for evidence of youth involvement, and community-wide support. This time there was also a specific focus on intermediate age and younger, given many projects previously funded focus on teenagers and their families,” said Mrs Turia.

“Twelve of the selected projects target Year 8 and under. This is an important group to focus on, as bullying can start from a very early age and is often entrenched by secondary school,” says Mrs Turia.

“We were looking for fresh ideas and innovative approaches that take a positive non-punitive approach. The projects chosen are diverse – and all show evidence of genuine community commitment, willingness to collaborate and recognition of bullying as a serious issue for children and young people.”

“It is encouraging that the 19 community initiatives funded under Te Punanga Haumaru are once again spread around New Zealand, amongst urban and rural communities from Auckland to Invercargill. It shows the widespread passion all over this country for building strong families and communities where our kids can thrive.”

The addition of 19 new projects brings the total number of projects funded to 82. The fund is on-going and the opening date for the next round will be confirmed later in 2013.
