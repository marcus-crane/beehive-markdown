The Government has contributed $10,000 to the Marlborough Mayoral Earthquake Fund, Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye said today.

“On 16 August 2013 the Lake Grassmere earthquake caused widespread damage in Marlborough, particularly in the Seddon-Ward area,” Ms Kaye says.

“In response to this, the Mayor of the Marlborough District Council Alistair Sowman has established the Marlborough Mayoral Earthquake Fund, to help those who have experienced the greatest loss.

“The Mayor advises me that the fund will be used to assist members of the community who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the earthquake. It will be used primarily to assist Marlborough residents who need support to pay for things like household items, medical bills, food vouchers, power, telephone and immediate repairs to damaged homes to make them habitable.

“As Minister of Civil Defence I have access to emergency expenses to contribute to such disaster relief funds and in this instance $10,000 is appropriate to meet immediate needs. This contribution is consistent with contributions to relief funds for similar sized events in the past.

“I know that an event like this can be traumatic and some people need a bit of extra help to get through. I am pleased to be able to provide some support to the community at this time.”

Anyone can donate to the Marlborough Mayoral Earthquake Fund through internet banking – account number 02 0600 0202 861 00 and noting Earthquake Fund, or they may be made at the District Council offices.
