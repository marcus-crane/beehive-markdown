Finlayson Park School children in South Auckland will share their school’s rheumatic fever prevention programme with Health Minister Tony Ryall this afternoon.

The National-led Government is investing over $45 million preventing rheumatic fever, developing and raising awareness for this life-threatening disease. The programme is currently in over 200 schools and more than 47,000 children are participating.

“As part of our Better Public Services focus, the government has a target to reduce the incidence of rheumatic fever by two thirds to 1.4 cases per 100,000 people by June 2017,” Mr Ryall says.

“Our government in partnership with local schools is fighting back. Results won’t happen overnight but we’re confident we can reach the Better Public Services target.

“Statistically rheumatic fever is an illness that affects mostly Māori and Pacific children in our communities. It is a third world disease that has been in our community for far too long.” Mr Ryall says.

The Health Minister congratulates schools taking part in the programme including Finlayson Park School with special certificates.

“The investments made by our government and the vigilance of parents and local schools, are making a real difference to the fight against this disease.”
