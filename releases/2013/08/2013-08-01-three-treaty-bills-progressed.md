The House of Representatives sat through extended hours this morning to unanimously pass three bills for the settlement of historical Treaty claims through their first readings.

The Maungaharuru-Tangitu Hapū Claims Settlement Bill will give effect to the settlement of the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Maungaharuru-Tangitu Hapū.

The Ngā Punawai o Te Tokotoru Claims Settlement Bill will give effect to settlements reached with Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Ngāti Rangiteaorere, and Tapuika.

The Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Collective Settlement Bill will give effect to the collective redress of 13 claimant groups in relation to specific maunga (volcanic cones), motu (islands) and lands within the Tāmaki Makaurau region.

The bills have been now been referred to the Māori Affairs select committee, which will hear submissions and consider the bills before returning them to the House for their second readings.

“Our accelerated progress resolving historical Treaty of Waitangi claims means that we have more Treaty legislation before the house each year,” Mr Finlayson said. “Last year we introduced innovations such as extended sitting hours and cognate bills to ensure iwi who settle are not held up by the House.”

“The broad cross party support for these Treaty bills brings the people of Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Ngāti Rangiteaorere, Tapuika, Maungaharuru-Tangitu Hapū and Tāmaki Makaurau closer to enjoying the benefits of settlement. It demonstrates the importance of resolving all historical Treaty claims in a fair, just and timely way.

Copies of the deeds of settlement are available on the Office of Treaty Settlements’ website [www.ots.govt.nz](http://www.ots.govt.nz)
