Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced that grants totalling over $500,000 have been made to community organisations to promote and support volunteering.

“The grants were made through the Support for Volunteering Fund which aims to enable new and innovative approaches to the development and support of volunteering,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Whether it is arts, sports, health and emergency services or working with migrants, volunteers make a huge contribution to sustainable, active communities. Most community groups in New Zealand could not function without support from volunteers.”

Volunteering New Zealand has received $100,000 in funding and a further $338,000 was distributed to 15 regional volunteer centres.

“Volunteering New Zealand plays a leading role in the volunteer sector and builds volunteer capacity and capability within its member organisations. Their ongoing work promotes, supports and advocates for volunteering and encourages best practice in volunteering management.”

Seven organisations also received a total of $63,000 to undertake projects that promote and support volunteering in Māori, Pacific or ethnic communities.

“For example the Elizabeth Knox Home and Hospital has received funding for a project to increase the number of migrants involved in volunteering at their organisation and in the broader aged care sector.

“The volunteers will capture Knox residents’ stories and write case studies which they will share with other aged care organisations.

“The project not only promotes and supports volunteering within their migrant communities, but also gives the volunteers opportunities to improve literacy and personal confidence.

“To me this is what volunteering is all about, creating and building connections, and bringing together people of different backgrounds for a common purpose. These connections set the foundation for strengthening our communities.”
