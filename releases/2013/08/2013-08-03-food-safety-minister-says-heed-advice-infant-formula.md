Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye is encouraging consumers to heed the advice on potentially contaminated products provided this afternoon by the Director General of Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).

"The Director General of MPI has informed me today he is taking a cautionary approach and has exercised powers under the Food Act 1981 and the Animal Products Act 1999 to issue a Statutory Statement regarding potentially contaminated products on the New Zealand market and to provide advice to consumers," Ms Kaye says.

Ms Kaye says Government officials are working continuously to ensure public safety on the back of Fonterra’s notification yesterday afternoon about potentially contaminated products.

“I have been briefed regularly over the past 24 hours. MPI has co-ordinated a cross-agency group of officials from MPI, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ministry of Health to deliver the Government’s response to this notification and to obtain as much information as possible so the public can be appropriately informed,” Ms Kaye says.

“I urge consumers to heed the advice from MPI and to keep following that advice.

“My primary concern is that people are safe and that the public have the information they need to keep them safe.

“I advise parents and caregivers to take a precautionary approach and seek health advice if they have any concerns.”

Ms Kaye said she will be closely monitoring all developments on this issue.

“I am receiving regular briefings and officials will provide further updates to the public when new information becomes available. Trade Minister Tim Groser is also being briefed.”
