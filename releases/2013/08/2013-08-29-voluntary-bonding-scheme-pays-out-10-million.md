$10 million has been paid out to hundreds of graduate doctors, nurses and midwives who have chosen to work in hard-to-staff communities and specialities through the government’s voluntary bonding scheme.

The scheme was launched in 2009 to encourage newly-qualified doctors, nurses and midwives to work in hard-to-staff communities and specialties by offering payments to student loans after a three to five year bonded period.

Last year, the scheme was expanded to include medical physicists and radiation therapists. This year, a post graduate entry opportunity was introduced for GP trainees prepared to work in hard-to-staff communities.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said so far 67 doctors, 368 nurses and 66 midwives had received payments under the scheme.

“The popularity of this scheme means more health professionals are working where we need them most,” says Mr Ryall.

“Recruiting and retaining front line staff is a key priority for this government and investment in schemes such as this are an integral part of achieving this.

“Applications for payment for the 2009 and 2010 intakes are now being accepted. If you have participated in the scheme and believe you are now eligible to apply for payment, I encourage you to contact Health Workforce New Zealand,” says Mr Ryall.

The application for second payment for the 2009 intake can be found at:

“District health boards now permanently employ more than 1000 extra doctors and 2500 extra nurses than they did in 2008,” says Mr Ryall.
