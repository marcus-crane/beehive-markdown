Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says today’s passing of the Inquiries Bill will reform and modernise the law relating to inquiries.

“The Inquiries Bill amends the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908 and was long overdue for an update. It has been on hold since 2009 to enable the completion of the Pike River and Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commissions of Inquiry.

“Following the Royal Commissions, the Government identified a number of improvements that could be made to the Bill. I am pleased that we were able to make these changes with support across the House, and pass the Bill quickly through its remaining stages.

“The legislation provides for two new types of inquiry - public inquiries and government inquiries.

“Public inquiries will be established for matters of significant public importance. Government inquiries will deal with more immediate issues where a quick, independent and authoritative answer is required. The first use of this legislation will be to establish a government inquiry into the recent whey protein contamination incident.

“I would like to thank the Law Commission, Government Administration Select Committee and parties across the House for their work and support of this Bill.”
