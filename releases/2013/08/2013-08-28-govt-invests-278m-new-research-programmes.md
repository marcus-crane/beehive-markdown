New Zealand researchers will receive $278 million in new research investment, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The 51 research programmes receiving funding are in the biological industries, high-value manufacturing and services, energy and minerals, environmental, and health and society sectors.

“Science and innovation is critical to New Zealand’s economic success and growth. Our science investments must result in research programmes that deliver economic, environmental, and social outcomes,” Mr Joyce says.

“All the successful proposals not only meet these standards, but also cover a diverse range of topics - from safeguarding our $1.7 billion seafood industry to helping New Zealand companies to incorporate high-temperature superconductors in practical products for the electricity industry.”

Other proposals that will receive funding include:

- Developing new materials for 3D printing and use by New Zealand industry
- Assessing how downsizing in housing affects the independence of older adults
- Protecting our native forests from devastating plant diseases
- Improving knowledge of New Zealand’s complex geothermal systems allowing better use of their energy potential

Many of the proposals involve collaborations between several research organisations, with industry partners contributing co-funding and market knowledge to help accelerate commercial outcomes.

“The calibre of the proposals received this year was extremely high and true reflection of the great talent, excellent science, and strong engagement with users of research in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

Through the submission process, 229 proposals were received. The Science and Innovation Minister’s Science Board made the final investment decisions following a robust peer review and assessment process by independent experts. 

The new research contracts will take effect from 1 October this year and will run for between one and seven years.

**What is the Science Investment Rounds?**

The 2013 Science Investment Rounds is the process for the Science Board to determine how funds will be invested across investment priority areas.

**What funds are you investing in?**

- Biological Industries
- High-Value Manufacturing and Services (HVMS)
- Energy and Minerals
- Health and Society
- Environmental

There is no new investment in hazards and infrastructure as there were no funds released from maturing contracts in the Hazards and Infrastructure Research Fund for new investment in 2013.

**Why were those funds chosen?**

Funds will become available from maturing contracts in these research funds. 

**Who made funding decisions?**

Independent experts assessed proposals and the Science Board made funding decisions in line with criteria published in the *New Zealand Gazette*.

The Science Board – not the Minister – made the ultimate decisions in funding.

**What were the criteria used to assess proposals?**

Funding decisions were made after a transparent process, in which every applicant had the same information and opportunities.  Decisions were made against the same criteria.

The eligibility and assessment criteria are outlined in notices in the *New Zealand Gazette*. 

The criteria differed for each investment mechanism under the science-led contestable funding tool (Smart Ideas, Enabling Technologies, Targeted Research, Capability in Independent Research Organisations Funding and the Sandpit Process Funding tool). 

More information on the criteria is available at the following links:

**How many proposals were submitted?  How many were approved for funding?**

Research providers submitted 229 proposals for funding. The Science Board has approved to fund 51 of these proposals.  Therefore 22 per cent of proposals will receive funding.

**How much money will be invested?**

Over seven years, $278 million (excl GST) will be invested.

**What percentage of the funding will go to Crown research institutes, universities and others?**

Crown research institutes will receive 54 per cent of funding, universities will receive 12% and independent research organisations and other research providers will receive the balance.

**When will the funding start?**

Funding will commence from 1 October 2013, following conclusion of the contracting of successful proposals.

**What’s different from previous years?**

This year a new funding tool was used, which gave independent research organisations (IROs) the opportunity to apply for long-term funding from the Biological Industries and High-Value Manufacturing and Services Research Funds for research to support nationally significant capabilities. 

Cawthron Institute and the New Zealand Leather and Shoe Research Association both submitted proposals under this mechanism and were approved for funding.

**For those that were unsuccessful, what are their options?**

This year’s Investment Round was oversubscribed and unfortunately not every proposal can be funded. As this is a contestable process, the results depend on the number of proposals received, the quality of proposals received and the amount of funding available. 

MBIE is not the only source for funding.  If a provider wishes to maintain a research team that experiences a reduction in funding, options include using internal funding, seeking commercial revenue, or applying for funding from other public sources.

**What is the likely timing of the 2014 investment rounds?**

MBIE is currently making plans for the 2014 investment round and will consult with the sector shortly.
