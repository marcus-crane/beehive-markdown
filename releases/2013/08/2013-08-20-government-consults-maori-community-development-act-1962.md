The first comprehensive public consultation on the Māori Community Development Act since it was passed more than 50 years ago will take place throughout September, Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples announced today.

Dr. Pita Sharples said “the Māori Community Development Act 1962 had its genesis in a national conference of Māori leaders – 51-years on Māori people are being consulted on its future.”

“Government wants feedback from Māori communities and other stakeholders.  Nineteen consultation hui will be held across Aotearoa, and written feedback can also be emailed or sent direct to our consultation team,” said Dr Sharples.

In 1962 the Māori Community Development Act set up three mechanisms to support Māori community development; the New Zealand Māori Council (supported by three levels of Māori Associations), Māori Wardens and Community Officers.  A 2010 inquiry into the Act by the Māori Affairs Committee recommended Government seek feedback and undertake a comprehensive public consultation on its future.

“It’s time for Māori to have a say on the Act’s future, the role of pan Māori organisations and Māori community development in general,” said Dr Sharples.

The first hui will be held on Tuesday 3 September 2013 at Te Paatu Marae, Kaitaia. Further details about venues, dates and times can be found in the attached documents or at [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz).  Those who are unable to attend hui can email or freepost their feedback before Monday 30 September 2013 at 5pm.
