Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says changes to the Warrant of Fitness inspection system which will save New Zealanders $1.8 billion over 30 years, agreed by Cabinet in January this year, will be introduced in two stages.

“From 1 January 2014, light vehicles first registered anywhere between 2004 and 2008 will be required to have an annual, rather than the current six-monthly warrant of fitness inspection,” Mr Brownlee says.

“From 1 July 2014, annual inspections will be extended to include all light vehicles first registered anywhere on or after 1 January 2000.

“Also from this date new vehicles will receive an initial inspection, another one when they’re three years old, then annual inspections for their lifetime.

“Vehicles first registered anywhere before 1 January 2000 will remain on six-monthly inspections for their lifetime.

“Motorists won’t have to do anything different in relation to getting their Warrant of Fitness,” Mr Brownlee says.

“When they take their vehicle in for inspection at its next due date, the inspection agent will assign the appropriate date for its subsequent inspection.

“While the recent consultation on proposed changes indicated good support for the suggested approach of phasing-in the new Warrant of Fitness inspection frequency, submissions were varied on preferred start dates.

“The 1 January start date will provide the sector time to prepare for the changes while also ensuring New Zealanders begin receiving the benefits of the changes as soon as possible.

“Another part of the package of changes is a public awareness campaign to remind people they have a responsibility for the safety of their vehicle throughout the year.

“This $2 million, three-year information campaign will reach motorists through a range of mediums which could include advertising at vehicle-related locations and on radio, a website and brochures.

“The campaign will also be supported by focused Police enforcement activities,” Mr Brownlee says.

The changes also include extending the variable frequency range of certificate of fitness inspections.  From 1 July 2014, well-maintained heavy vehicles will be eligible to have a certificate of fitness applied from a range of three to 12 months, increased from the current three to nine months.

The default frequency will remain at six months.  Extending the inspection frequency will encourage and incentivise transport operators to maintain the safety of their vehicles.

Mr Brownlee this week signed into law the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Standards Compliance Amendment (No 2) 2013, which makes legal these changes to New Zealand’s vehicle inspection systems.

“The changes will save New Zealanders $1.8 billion \[in today’s money] over 30 years, without compromising road safety outcomes,” Mr Brownlee says.
