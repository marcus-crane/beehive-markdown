“A total of 381 people have put their names forward for places on the 20 District Health Boards in the upcoming elections; ten more than in 2010,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“I am advised candidate numbers per district range from 35 at Waitemata DHB down to 10 for South Canterbury DHB, which means there are enough candidates to hold an election in each district,” Mr Ryall says.

"That is important because DHBs are significant tax payer funded organisations and they account for most of the day–to–day business of the public health service.  They employ nearly 60,000 staff nationwide. In many parts of New Zealand the local DHB is the biggest employer with the biggest revenue."

Mr Ryall says candidate numbers have increased at 8 DHBs, stayed the same at 5 DHBs and decreased at 7 DHBs.

“122 incumbent members are standing (117 elected; five appointed) which is close to a third of all candidates, and 85 percent of incumbent elected members are standing for re-election.

“More women are standing in this election compared to 2010. This year 43% of candidates are women compared with 41% in 2010,” Mr Ryall says.

DHB elections will be held 12 October. They are carried out under the Single Transferable Voting System on an at large basis (with the exception of Southern DHB, which has two constituencies).  This means that voters get to express their preference for every candidate standing for their DHB.
