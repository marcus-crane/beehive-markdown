Justice Minister Judith Collins has received advice from officials regarding calls to re-examine the Teina Pora case.

Concerns have been raised about the convictions of Mr Pora in 1994 and again in 2000 for the rape and murder of Susan Burdett.

Mr Pora was convicted at a retrial in 2000 and an appeal against conviction heard by the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful.

Ms Collins says there are two ways that a person in Mr Pora’s situation can have their convictions re-assessed – through an application for the Royal prerogative of mercy or through an appeal to the Privy Council.

An application for the Royal prerogative of mercy involves an inquiry into a person’s convictions. This may involve the appointment of an independent person such as a retired High Court Judge or Queens Counsel to provide advice on the application.

Ms Collins says she is advised comments made by Mr Pora’s lawyer Jonathan Krebs regarding an inquiry were taken out of context.

Mr Pora filed an application for the Royal prerogative of mercy in September 2011. At the time the application was filed Mr Krebs advised the application was incomplete, and he was gathering further evidence. The application remains incomplete.

Ms Collins says it is for Mr Pora and his representatives to determine which route they wish to pursue.

“Officials have confirmed that Mr Krebs intends to lodge an appeal to the Privy Council shortly,” Ms Collins says.

“The Privy Council would have ability to quash the convictions or order a retrial.”
