Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy have welcomed the High Court’s decision to dismiss two appeals on the Board of Inquiry’s approval for New Zealand King Salmon to develop new marine farms in the Marlborough Sounds.

The decision of the Board of Inquiry, reached in February 2011, to approve four new salmon farming sites in the Marlborough Sounds was appealed by two parties and that appeal was heard at the High Court in Blenheim in May.

“The impacts of these new marine farms on the important recreation and conservation values of the Marlborough Sounds are small. This is about use of only six hectares of more than 100,000 hectares of water space in the Sounds,” Dr Smith says.

“We are a Bluegreen Government that wants jobs and development but also wants to ensure we look after our environment and great kiwi lifestyle. This decision confirms this balanced approach.”

“Primary industries are vital for economic growth in our regions, and aquaculture plays an important role in the Marlborough economy. I welcome the news that extra jobs will be created as a result of these new farms,” says Mr Guy.

“This decision is another step forward for New Zealand King Salmon in its plans to establish four new farms, delivering an additional $60 million a year in export income and providing 200 new jobs.”

“The decision reached by the High Court confirms the Board’s February decision. That decision was reached following a robust hearing process that worked through more than 1,200 public submissions, with more than 180 witnesses and submitters heard and over 10,400 pages of evidence received during a 37-day hearing.”

“This will make a strong contribution to the sector and the Government’s aim for a sustainable $1 billion aquaculture industry by 2025”, says Mr Guy.
