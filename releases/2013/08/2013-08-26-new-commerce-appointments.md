Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced three commerce appointments. Elisabeth Welson has been appointed to the Commerce Commission and Hon Sir Bruce Robertson, KNZM and Michael Behrens, QC have been appointed as Cease and Desist Commissioners.

“Ms Welson has a background and expertise on regulatory matters and experience having served as an associate member of the Commission. Sir Bruce and Michael Behrens have the appropriate expertise to hear and make a determination on applications for a cease and desist order against anti-competitive behaviour,” said Mr Foss.

Ms Welson, Hon Sir Bruce Robertson KNZM and Michael Behrens, QC have been appointed for five year terms beginning 19 August 2013.

Mr Foss acknowledged the contributions made by previous Commerce Commission member Donal Curtin and Cease and Desist Commissioners Hon Sir Richard Barker QC and Helen Cull QC.

Hon Sir Bruce Robertson KNZM is the current chair of the Disciplinary Committee under the Financial Advisers Act 2008. Sir Bruce retired in 2010 as a permanent judge of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, a position he held since 2005. He was a Divisional Judge of that Court for ten years.

Michael Behrens QC is a recently retired District Court Judge, a position he has held since 2004. Prior to his appointment as District Court Judge Michael Behrens lived and practised in Palmerston North as a sole practitioner and barrister sole.

Elisabeth Welson was appointed an associate member of the Commerce Commission in September 2012. Prior to her appointment she was a senior commercial Partner at a large commercial law firm based in Wellington. She co-led the firm’s competition and regulatory group and also headed up the energy, natural resources and utilities market group.
