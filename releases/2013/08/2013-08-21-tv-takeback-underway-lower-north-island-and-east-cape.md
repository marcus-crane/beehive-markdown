Environment Minister Amy Adams says a programme to encourage the recycling of unwanted televisions and raise investment in New Zealand’s electronic recycling capacity has today been launched in more than 20 North Island towns and cities.

The TV TakeBack programme aims to divert televisions from going to landfill in an initiative that involves the Government partnering with a range of councils, recyclers and retailers to provide a nationwide network of subsidised options.

The programme is being rolled out around New Zealand to coincide with the digital switchover in each region.

The initiative today starts in more than 20 towns and cities, including Wellington, Porirua, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, Kapiti, Masterton, Carterton, Martinborough, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Feilding, Levin, Gisborne and New Plymouth.

Residents in each town and city will be advised of the various recycling options via a local promotional campaign.

The initiative will get underway in the remaining parts of the North Island, including Auckland, in October.

The TV TakeBack scheme makes recycling a television affordable and straightforward. Through a Government subsidy, the cost to the public to recycle a television is no more than $5.

“The low-cost of televisions and the switch from analogue to digital television is creating a surge in unwanted sets,” Ms Adams says.

“The Government has recognised this as a potential growing waste problem, so we have committed money to encourage New Zealanders to responsibly recycle their televisions.

“There is now no excuse for not disposing of televisions responsibly.”

The programme was first launched in Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast in September. It was then extended to the rest of the South Island in March.

Almost 105,000 televisions have been collected for recycling during these phases of the programme.
