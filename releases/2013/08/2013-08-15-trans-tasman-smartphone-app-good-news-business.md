Commerce Minister Craig Foss has launched a Trans-Tasman smartphone app today, allowing consumers in New Zealand and Australia to search more than 2.5 million registered companies using their smartphone.

The Companies Office has partnered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to develop *NZAUConnect*.  The *NZAUConnect* app enables users to obtain information from the Australian and New Zealand Companies Registers along with the Australian Business Names Register.

“It is now possible to simultaneously search two million registered companies in Australia, and 550,000 in New Zealand on your smartphone,” says Mr Foss.

“In addition, *NZAUConnect* provides the ability to search a further 1.7 million organisations on the Australian National Business Names Register.

“Currently there are around eight million searches of the New Zealand Companies Office Register each year. The *NZAUConnect* app will see people able to search on the go, for free and from any location, provided they have a smartphone with a data or Wi-Fi connection,” says Mr Foss.

The Companies Office has recently introduced QR codes and Company Badges, both initiatives aimed at making it easier for users to verify company details online.

“It makes business sense for both the New Zealand and Australian governments to work closely, given many of our businesses are operating here and across the Tasman. We will continue looking at innovative ways to make it easier to do business in both countries,” says Mr Foss.

*NZAUConnect* can be downloaded for free from App Store and Google Play by searching for 'NZAUConnect'.
