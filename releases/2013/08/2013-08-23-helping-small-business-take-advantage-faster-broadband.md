Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today announced a new training programme to help small businesses take advantage of the Government’s ultra-fast broadband and rural broadband programmes.

A Digital Enablement Training programme will be rolled out across New Zealand in the coming months.

The programme includes workshops to examine how UFB, RBI and other new technologies will impact on companies and identifies the opportunities it presents.

Ms Adams says despite the fact that nearly two million New Zealanders want to buy online, only 64 per cent of small businesses have a website and only 11 per cent offer customers the ability to pay online.

“The internet is a strong and growing marketplace. Faster broadband can deliver greater productivity and lower costs, but small businesses need to know how to use it to maximum effect.

“Fast broadband enables businesses to connect easily to the world, and our investment in broadband will support innovation, high-tech jobs, and grow productivity.

“The Digital Enablement Training programme will help these businesses understand the benefits that UFB, RBI and ICT services can bring, and help them make more sophisticated use of the tools and services available.”

The programme has been supported by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and will be available through the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Regional Business Partner Network around New Zealand.

Ms Adams says the Government’s UFB and RBI programmes are making good progress.

A year two report on the broadband programmes released earlier this month showed more than 300,000 end users can now connect to the UFB network.

In addition, more than 149,000 homes and businesses in rural areas now have access to faster broadband under the RBI.
