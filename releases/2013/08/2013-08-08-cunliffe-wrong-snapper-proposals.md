Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says Labour MP David Cunliffe is completely wrong in his claims that changes to the commercial quota for Snapper 1 are off the table.

Section 8.4 on page 58 of the Snapper 1 consultation document says: *“The Minister could decide to change existing proportions up or down for either the commercial or recreational sector.”*

“Mr Cunliffe has got his facts wrong and should read the consultation document. There are a full range of options, including options that cut the catch limit for commercial fishers while leaving the recreational rules unchanged.

“There is no predetermined outcome and we want to hear the views of the public before making any decision.

“This is the most important inshore fishery in New Zealand. We need to ensure that the benefits are shared fairly, and that it is sustainable for our children and grandchildren.

“All options are on the table for a full and open consultation. You can’t have proper consultation by limiting options.

“I encourage people to have their say before the closing date of August 23. I will then make a decision by 1 October,” says Mr Guy.
