Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has announced that more Kiwis than ever before protected themselves against the flu this year.

The 2013 Influenza Programme ended on 31 July with a total of 1,253,830 flu vaccines distributed. This number even exceeds the 1.02 million doses distributed in 2010 following the 2009 flu pandemic.

“While we can’t be absolutely sure all the vaccines were used until all excess doses are returned, we can be sure that we have easily met our target of 1.2 million New Zealanders immunised against flu,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“The success of this year’s programme is the result of all the hard work by healthcare professionals who made sure as many people as possible were immunised. I wish to thank these professionals for their efforts and commitment to improving the health of all Kiwis.”

Of the 1.25 million vaccine doses distributed just under 690,000 were accessed for free by eligible people. The remainder were purchased privately either by individuals or by workplace immunisation programmes.

“The 2013 programme of free flu vaccinations has now ended, but the vaccine can still be purchased from general practitioners, travel clinics or selected pharmacies,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“While the flu season has been mild so far this year, the flu is a very unpredictable disease, so it is always best to protect yourself and your family by immunising against it.

“I hope that we will see an even higher number of flu vaccines distributed during the next year’s programme.”
