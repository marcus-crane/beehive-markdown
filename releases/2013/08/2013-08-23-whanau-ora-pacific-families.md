Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hekia Parata welcomes the release of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for a Commissioning Agency for Pacific families. It marks an important milestone for Whanau Ora and the work being done to respond to the aspirations of Pacific families says Ms Parata.

“I congratulate Minister Tariana Turia, Te Puni Kōkiri and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs for working together on this key milestone.

“The announcement today means we are an important step closer to meeting Pacific aspirations with Pacific community at the heart of it,” says Ms Parata.

Whānau Ora for Pacific families is about achieving the overall outcome of prosperity for all ‘Pacific families’ living in Aotearoa.  The new Commissioning Agency for Pacific Families will be expected to foster this by commissioning innovative and fit-for-purpose activities that best meet the needs of *kopu tangata, vuvale, magafaoa, āiga, fāmili, kāiga, **family*** from a range of Pacific stakeholders such as: extended-family and village groups; sporting and cultural groups; faith-based and church groups; education providers; community organisations and NGOs.

“Pacific stakeholders will also be involved in developing a Pacific-focused Whānau Ora outcomes framework, and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs will play a pivotal role in establishing the frameworks to guide procurement and contracting, as well as supporting community engagements,” says Ms Parata.

Te Puni Kōkiri will be the Administering Department for all Whānau Ora Commissioning Agencies, including the Commissioning Agency for Pacific Families.  The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Whānau Ora, in consultation with the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, will confirm the preferred NGO Commissioning Agency for Pacific families.
