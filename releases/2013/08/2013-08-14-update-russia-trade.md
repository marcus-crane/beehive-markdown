Trade Minister Tim Groser and Primary Industries Nathan Guy say that officials are working closely with Russian authorities to provide the reassurance they need over New Zealand dairy products.

“Russia has formally notified New Zealand of a temporary restriction of dairy imports from 61 of the 83 dairy plants approved for export to Russia,” says Mr Groser.

“Overnight, New Zealand officials in Moscow have confirmed that the restriction is now also being applied by Kazakhstan and Belarus. As the three countries are in a Customs Union, this is not unexpected.”

“MPI and MFAT, along with the New Zealand Embassy in Moscow, are working to reopen the market, including by meeting with key food safety and health officials in Moscow,” says Mr Guy.

“New Zealand was aware last week that Russia had concerns about the Clostridium botulinum incident. On 7 August MPI suspended Fonterra dairy exports to Russia so that we could work through their concerns.

“No potentially contaminated product has been exported to Russia, Kazakhstan or Belarus from New Zealand. However Russia has taken a precautionary approach, and we are now working to reassure the appropriate agencies of all the steps being taken by MPI and MFAT on this matter.”

Total dairy trade to Russia for 2012 was around $106 million, and $310,608 for Kazakhstan. There are virtually no New Zealand dairy products exported to Belarus.
