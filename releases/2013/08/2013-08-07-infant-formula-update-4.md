Health Minister Tony Ryall and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye say Plunket nurses are today contacting as many Plunket mothers as they can who are using infant formula to ensure they are aware of the recall.

“And the Ministry of Health is discussing with Tamariki Ora WellChild providers to ensure they are passing on the information to their families using infant formula,” Mr Ryall says.

“The recalled products are Nutricia Karicare Stage 1 infant formula (0-6 months) – all batches and Nutricia Karicare Gold+ Stage 2 follow on formula (6-12 months) – all batches,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Government has committed funds towards advertising to assist the public information campaign,” Ms Kaye says.

“We want to ensure that this message is accessible for parents and caregivers in New Zealand and abroad. There will be documents in different languages relating to the recall available on the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) website.

“The Director-General of MPI has held a press conference today outlining the processes underway to trace and verify products and data.

“He has advised the Ministerial response group that MPI’s traceability work indicates that there is no contaminated product beyond the two product lines recalled by Nutricia in New Zealand,” Ms Kaye says.

Mr Ryall says the Ministry of Health has sent advisories to GPs, paediatricians and district health boards updating the current situation – and it reports that to date, no notifications of cases of infant botulism have been received.

“If families have any concerns whatsoever about their infants, they should contact their GP or call Healthline or Plunketline,” Mr Ryall says.

“This has been an anxious time for families using the infant formula for their babies, both in New Zealand and for families in other countries who depend on the infant formula,” Ms Kaye says.

“We hope they all access the information and advice widely available on the websites of the Ministries of Health and Primary Industries and Plunket.”

“Yesterday I visited the Plunket and Healthline call centres to pass on our appreciation for the work they are doing to keep families and the public informed,” Mr Ryall says.

Mr Ryall says if people are on a low income or receiving benefits, Work and Income may be able to help with costs they are facing because of the Karicare infant formula recall.
