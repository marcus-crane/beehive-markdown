Health Minister Tony Ryall and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye say a public information campaign is underway to inform parents about the voluntary recall by Nutricia of two lines of infant formula that may be contaminated.

“The recalled products are Karicare Stage 1 New Baby Infant Formula (from birth) and Karicare Gold+ Stage 2 Follow-on Formula (from 6 months) all batches,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), as New Zealand’s food safety regulator, is able to assist companies when they do voluntary recalls.

“MPI has been communicating with the public in a variety of ways regarding the advisory statements it has issued.

“Now that there is a definitive recall across the two product lines, MPI is assisting Nutricia to ramp up public information,” Ms Kaye says.

This includes:

- National advertising of statutory recall notice
- Radio advertising
- Facebook advertising
- Online advertising
- People can get information and advice from Healthline 0800 611 116, Plunketline 0800 933 922, MPI’s consumer helpline 0800 693 721

“Ministers are speaking regularly with food and grocery industry members regarding supply of existing alternative infant formula products,” Mr Ryall says.

“The industry is putting in place arrangements to secure the on-going supply of these other infant formula products and Ministers’ will be updated daily about the level of supplies.”

“The Government is working closely with industry to ensure parents and caregivers have all the information they need at this time,” Ms Kaye says.
