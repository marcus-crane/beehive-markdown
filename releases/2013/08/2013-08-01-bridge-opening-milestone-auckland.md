Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed today’s opening of the new Ellerslie-Panmure Highway bridge.

“This new bridge is a significant milestone for the Auckland Manukau Eastern Transport Initiative (AMETI), which broadens transport options and frees up roads in an area with some of New Zealand’s highest traffic flows and resulting congestion,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Combining AMETI with an East-West Link is the Government’s next major focus for the Auckland transport network.

“The suburbs of Onehunga, Mt Wellington and East Tamaki are home to a number of industrial and logistics businesses that make a critical contribution to Auckland and the national economy.

“Businesses in this area already employ around the same number of people as workers in Auckland’s CBD, and there is considerable potential for many more jobs.

“Together, AMETI and the East-West Link have the potential to unlock the economic potential of this important part of Auckland.

“I have asked the NZ Transport Agency to work with Auckland Transport and report back to me about which elements of AMETI and the East-West Link should be brought forward with additional funding.

“This work will be completed in December, and I expect that the Government will make funding decisions in the first quarter of 2014.”
