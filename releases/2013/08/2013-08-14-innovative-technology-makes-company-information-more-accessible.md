Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the launch of QR codes and Company Badges as the Companies Office continues to make company information accessible online.

“It’s great to see the Companies Office giving businesses and individuals easy access to validate company credentials online,” says Mr Foss.

A QR code is a matrix barcode that can be scanned with a smartphone to access information about a product or company.

A Company Badge is an icon that can be embedded within a company’s website. When a user clicks on the Company Badge, they will be linked to the Companies Register website for further details about the current status of that company.

“These two initiatives are practical examples of how the government is achieving its Better Public Services commitment to increase availability of information though digital services across government agencies,” says Mr Foss.

“It’s common for clients to want to better understand companies they are dealing with and quickly find out whether they’re registered with the NZ Companies Office.

“The use of QR Codes and Company Badges is now being rolled out, with further technology enhancements planned,” says Mr Foss.
