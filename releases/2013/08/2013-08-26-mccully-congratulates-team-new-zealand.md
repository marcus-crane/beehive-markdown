Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully today congratulated Team New Zealand on winning the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series in San Francisco.

“Team New Zealand’s impressive run in the challenger series will stand them in good stead as they prepare to race Oracle for the America’s Cup next month,” Mr McCully says.

“Captain Dean Barker and the crew have remained composed and professional throughout the regatta, all while maintaining a strong lead.

“Luna Rossa, Team New Zealand’s design and training partners, have been gracious opponents and I am pleased to hear they have agreed to help Team New Zealand fine tune their boat as they attempt to regain the Auld Mug.”
