Education Minister Hekia Parata says releasing comprehensive data on how New Zealand children are doing at school is an important part of this Government’s approach to raising the achievement of all our kids in education.

Ms Parata released the *Education Report 2013* – a report card on progress in the Government priority areas in education.

“When I became Minister of Education I said we needed to start using the data we collect and collect data we don’t have to focus our resources. It’s about shifting away from statistics to numbers, from numbers to names and from names to needs. We have to make the story of our young people real. Statistics can mask that.  

“For the first time I am pleased to be able to bring together in one place a report on the metrics which track progress of our children through the education system,” says Ms Parata.

“The Government has set ambitious goals for meaningful improvement in education of all children, from 0 to 18 years old. This report confirms we are well on track, but also keeps us honest – we need to keep a laser-like focus on achievement and act quickly when we see a child can learn more and where we see children falling behind. For example Māori and Pasifika achievement rates are trending up, but still from a very low base. With good and consistent data we can target specific needs – as we have done with funding in this year’s Budget.

“My intention is to release this report card annually, so that all those with an interest in the education sector, but especially parents and whanau, can use to talk to their teachers and principals about the achievement of their children.”

Ms Parata says at the end of the month the Ministry of Education will also be releasing a range of school-by-school data, including on National Standards attainment.

Additionally, the Ministry is undertaking a series of regional workshops on achievement, retention and transition and will be releasing data on education at Territorial Local Authority level.

“As the saying goes, *“without data you are just another person with an opinion”.* As Minister I have championed the creation of a data rich environment for parents and teachers, so that we can focus on raising achievement, so that all New Zealand kids succeed,” says Ms Parata.

The full Report will be accessible on the following website from tomorrow: [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)
