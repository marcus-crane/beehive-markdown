Today Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced a $15.64m investment in new facilities for Tarawera High School.

“This is a great outcome for the Kawerau community and for the educational future of its young people. This is a significant investment reflecting the importance we place on raising achievement, and success for all,” says Ms Parata.

“We want to deliver a sustainable, modern learning environment for greatest benefit to students, families and whānau and to the Kawerau community as a whole.”

Design work will start immediately, with construction getting underway early in 2014 and taking around 15 months to complete.

“The new school will be progressively built. This means the school will be able to continue operations on site and the Ministry of Education will work with the board of trustees to minimise disruption to school operations,” says Ms Kaye.

“I am sure these facilities will be a great boost for young people in Kawerau.”
