Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed the State Services Commission’s announcement of Lou Sanson as the new Director-General of the Department of Conservation.

“Conservation is a large operational department with huge land holdings and unique responsibilities. I am delighted that Mr Sanson, who has long-term experience with DOC since its inception in 1987, brings to the role an in-depth knowledge of practical conservation work. It is a strength that the bulk of his experience has been from Southland, given that most of our conservation challenges are in the more remote parts of New Zealand,” Dr Smith says.

“Mr Sanson experience as chief executive of Antarctica New Zealand over the past 11 years is a good foundation for leading DOC. Both organisations are about conserving nature, managing natural risks in challenging environments, partnerships with others, and harnessing good science – albeit DOC is significantly larger.

“The department needs a consistency of direction after the major restructuring currently being implemented by retiring Director-General Al Morrison. I am pleased Mr Sanson is committed to these reforms and I see his number one priority as ensuring the new partnership model for the department successfully beds in.

“This is a significant appointment for DOC which has had a succession of very committed and talented Director-Generals, including Al Morrison. Mr Sanson’s appointment bodes well for the department’s future.”

Mr Sanson will take over from Al Morrison, who is leaving to take up the role of Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Centre at the State Services Commission, on 14 September
