Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced the Government is investing a further $542,000 to continue the environmental recovery programme, following the Rena grounding.

Today’s announcement brings the total Government funding for the programme to $2.42 million.

The programme identifies the environmental issues for the beaches, seabed, water fisheries, wildlife and management of waste, and sets out the responsibility for the recovery and monitoring of each aspect.

“The extra funding will be used to continue the monitoring of water quality and kaimoana, restore shorelines, protect wildlife and assess the mauri of the Bay of Plenty area,” Ms Adams says.

“It has been almost two years since the Rena was first grounded on the Astrolabe Reef and we have come a long way in the environmental recovery.

“While good progress has already been made to date, it is important that we continue to monitor the Bay of Plenty environment to give us a better understanding of what still needs to be done.

“I would like to thank all those involved for their hard work and commitment to the continued environmental recovery of the Bay of Plenty environment.

“Collaboration between the community, iwi, businesses, central and local government has been a key success of the project.

“With their help, we will continue to work to restore the Bay of Plenty environment back to its pre-Rena state.”
