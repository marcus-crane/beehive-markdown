Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says more than 100,000 people have now renewed their passports online as part of a drive by  the Government to change the way New Zealanders deal with government departments.

“This is a great example of what we can achieve with successful IT projects,” says Mr Tremain.

“The online passport renewal service has saved New Zealanders close to $7 million in passport fees since it was launched in November last year.

“New Zealand is the first country to have online passport renewals.  Over 20,000 New Zealanders overseas have renewed their passports online and  people are telling me how impressed they are with the service.   Renewing your passport online is easy and there is a very quick turn-around time. 

“People expect that it should be easy to deal with government departments for the services they need.  The Government is delivering on this as part of our Better Public Services goals.  We want 70 per cent of the most common transactions with government to be able to be done online by 2017. Online passport renewals are one of those transactions.”

The Passport Online Renewal Service is available for adults over the age of 16, who are renewing their passport at a cost of $124.50.  A full list of eligibility criteria can be found at [www.passports.govt.nz](http://www.passports.govt.nz/).
