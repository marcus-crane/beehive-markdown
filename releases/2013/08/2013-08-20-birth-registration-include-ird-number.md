Revenue Minister Todd McClay and Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain say parents registering the birth of their baby can also now apply for their child’s IRD number.

A joint service provided by the Department of Internal Affairs and Inland Revenue means parents can get an IRD number for their new baby by simply ticking a box, and supplying a small amount of extra information, on the Birth Registration form.

“Since 1 July, Inland Revenue has received more than 1,000 applications for IRD numbers for babies using the new service, meaning 94% of parents of newborns are choosing to apply for an IRD number for their child,” says Todd McClay.

“The advantage is that once parents have an IRD number they can immediately apply for Working for Families Tax credits, KiwiSaver or opening a bank account for the child.”

“As well as being an easy option for parents this service also saves them money. Parents no longer have to buy a birth certificate to get an IRD number. Instead of filling out multiple forms they now have the option of ticking a box on a form they already have to complete.”

Currently, parents of about half of the 60,000 children born each year apply for a child’s IRD number within the child’s first year.

“The Department of Internal Affairs and Inland Revenue have worked together to make sure the verification process is secure and meets the strict standards for authentication,” says Mr Tremain.

“This initiative is part of the Government’s drive for better public services. Effective collaborations like this result in faster, easier and cheaper services for New Zealanders.”
