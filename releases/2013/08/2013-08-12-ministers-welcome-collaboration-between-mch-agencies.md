Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson and Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss have welcomed collaboration that will lead to greater efficiencies and savings for Crown entities NZ On Air, the New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC) and The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA).

The three agencies are now based at the same location and have increased sharing of back office functions. A blessing was held this morning to mark the occasion.

“NZ On Air and the NZ Film Commission already work closely together, but the move is likely to see further opportunities for collaboration and efficiency through sharing resources,” says Mr Foss.

NZ On Air and the BSA are sharing services and some administration staff.

“Following the review of machinery of government, these organisations were encouraged to work more closely together in sharing back room functions, to maximise the funds available for their core businesses of promoting the growth of New Zealand’s cultural sector,” says Mr Finlayson. “I want to congratulate the NZFC, NZ On Air and BSA on this prudent move.”

“It is great to see government agencies taking the initiative to share back office functions which ensures better value for the tax-payer,” says Mr Foss. 

NZ On Air and the NZFC are already working together on a range of initiatives, having recently announced the creation of a [$2.5 million documentary fund](http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/industry-news/2013/mar/128315-new-25m-documentary-fund) for feature-length documentaries.

“While these three agencies operate in quite separate environments, and with different mandates, I would like to congratulate them on seeing the opportunity to work more closely,” says Mr Finlayson.

“I’m confident we will see more collaboration in the future as the creative and broadcasting industries continue to evolve and meet the challenges of a digital age,” says Mr Foss.
