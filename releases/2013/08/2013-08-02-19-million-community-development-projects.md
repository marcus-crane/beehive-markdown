Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced that eight new community development projects around the country will be supported with over $1.9 million of funding from the Community Development Scheme. 

“The Community Development Scheme supports communities which are working to generate their own solutions to local issues, and aspiring to become more self-reliant and resilient,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The scheme focuses on community-driven and based projects that enable communities to work together in new ways, to be innovative and to determine their own development priorities in order to achieve sustainable community outcomes.

“For example, the Rotorua Community Youth Centre will receive funding from the scheme for a project that aims to connect young people with older members of the community, to encourage learning by younger people and help older people remain connected and engaged with the community. 

“Another example is Patumahoe Primary School, which will be funded to lead initiatives aiming to strengthen and preserve the local sense of identity.  In the first year this will include reinstating the community newsletters, expanding the community website and holding workshops on local environmental issues.”

The other six projects that will receive funding are being led by Helensville District Health Trust, Counties Manukau Sport Foundation, Te Ora Hou Te Tairāwhiti Trust, Prison Fellowship New Zealand, YMCA of South and Mid Canterbury and Grey District Council. Each of the eight projects will receive funding of $80,000 plus GST per year for three years.
