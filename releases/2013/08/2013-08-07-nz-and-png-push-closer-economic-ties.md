Prime Minister John Key today met with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O’Neill at Parliament for talks focused on encouraging closer economic cooperation between New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.

“Papua New Guinea is set to become New Zealand’s largest trading partner in the Pacific and we have agreed to look at ways of encouraging further economic ties,” Mr Key says.

“There are extensive opportunities for New Zealand business, particularly around developing infrastructure to support Papua New Guinea’s rapid economic growth.

“Mr O’Neill said he would like to see more Papua New Guinea students studying in New Zealand and we strongly support this, both through scholarships New Zealand offers, and closer links between our tertiary institutions.

“As well as experiencing rapid economic growth, Papua New Guinea is increasingly a leader in the Pacific region and they are active on the international stage. New Zealand wants to support them as they seek to play a greater role in international affairs and the affairs of our own region,” Mr Key says.

Mr Key says today’s meeting was an excellent opportunity to hear Mr O’Neill’s views ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum next month and to take stock of the New Zealand Aid Programme’s joint achievements in Papua New Guinea.

“We have also agreed to look at further opportunities for cooperation in areas such as renewable energy, agriculture, community policing in Bougainville, and the further development of the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme,” Mr Key says.
