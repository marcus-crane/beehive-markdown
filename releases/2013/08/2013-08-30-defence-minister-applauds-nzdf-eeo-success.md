Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman today congratulated the New Zealand Defence Force on the recognition it received at the ANZ and EEO Trust Diversity Awards.

The NZDF’s support structure for LGBTIQ staff, Operation OverWatch, picked up the supreme award and the NZDF/MSD Youth Development Unit received a highly commended award for its residential course.

“OverWatch was established to support NZDF people, so they can do a professional job while having easy access to personal support. It is great to see the success of the programme being recognised” said Dr Coleman.

"It is important that the NZDF reflects the face of modern New Zealand and that we are able to attract great people who feel that the NZDF is a place where they want to make a contribution."

“I was also pleased to note the award given to the NZDF’s Youth Development Unit. The YDU has played a crucial role in providing thousands of young people with the skills and discipline to succeed in life”.
