Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced appointments to the Building Practitioners Board.

“Christopher Preston has been appointed member and Deputy Chair, and Melbourne Orange has been appointed as a member. Both terms are for three years.

“Brian Nightingale and William Smith have been reappointed for two year terms,” Mr Williamson says.

Mr Preston is currently a professional director. He is the former acting chief executive for the Registered Master Builders Association and Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ).

“Christopher Preston has proven governance and leadership skills, having held a number of chair positions for BRANZ, Life Time Design Limited and a local business association,” Mr Williamson says.

Mr Orange is a self-employed barrister and solicitor from Christchurch working in the energy, electrical and construction industries.

“Melbourne Orange is currently a member of the Electrical Workers Registration Board and will bring substantial disciplinary hearing experience to the Board,” Mr Williamson says.

The Building Practitioners Board was established under section 341 of the Building 2004. The Board’s functions are to approve rules relating to licensed building practitioners, investigate, hear complaints and discipline licensed building practitioners. It also hears appeals against decisions of the Registrar.
