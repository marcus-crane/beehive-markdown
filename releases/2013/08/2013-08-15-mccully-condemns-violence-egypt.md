Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has condemned the violent events in Egypt overnight.

“The use of military force against civilians is completely unacceptable and deserves strong condemnation,” Mr McCully says.

“The New Zealand Government continues to urge all parties to exercise restraint. Egypt’s future can only be secured through an inclusive political process that incorporates all parties.”

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise New Zealanders against all tourist and other non-essential travel to Egypt.
