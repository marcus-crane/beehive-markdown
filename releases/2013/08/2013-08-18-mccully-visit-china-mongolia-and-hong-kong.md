Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to China, Mongolia and Hong Kong this week for a series of bilateral meetings.

“This visit, which has been planned for some time, will enable me to update authorities on the response to recent meat and dairy issues,” Mr McCully says.

In China, Mr McCully will meet his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and State Councillor Yang Jiechi to discuss a wide range of issues.

“Our relationship with China is much broader than trade. We are working closely together on a range of issues, including in the Pacific where China is an increasingly important player,” Mr McCully says.

“Te Mato Vai, the $60 million water partnership between New Zealand, China and the Cook Islands, is the first of its kind and a blueprint for future development cooperation in the region.”

Mr McCully will also make his first visit to Mongolia where he will meet President Elbegdorj Tsakhia and Foreign Minister Bold Luvsanvandan to discuss possible cooperation in agriculture and education.

In Hong Kong, Mr McCully will meet government representatives and members of the business community.
