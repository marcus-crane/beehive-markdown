Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says the LINZ Data Service has set the benchmark for the release of public data for reuse, innovation and enterprise.

Launched in 2011, LDS provides free and open access to Land Information New Zealand’s fundamental land and seabed datasets to support the creation of new and improved products and services across business, government and the community.

“Offering more than 40 datasets for direct integration with business systems has led to cost savings, productivity improvements, product innovation and improved decision-making for those accessing the information.

“It has proven to be a revolution in the way people discover, use and share non-personal public data and is a testament to the value of the Government’s open data programme and geospatial strategy,” Mr Williamson says.

There are currently more than 5,600 registered LDS users, which span the geospatial, survey, utility, information technology, contracting and engineering industries, and community organisations and central and local government.

“The fact LDS has won international acclaim, including two awards at the 2012 Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards, illustrates how good a tool it is.”
