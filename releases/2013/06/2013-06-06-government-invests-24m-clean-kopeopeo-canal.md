A Government-funded clean-up of the Kopeopeo Canal in the Bay of Plenty means the community will eventually be able to swim and fish in the waterway for the first time in decades.

Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced the Government has committed an extra $880,000 to clean up the canal. This funding is in addition to the $1.5 million invested by the Government in 2011.

“Kopeopeo Canal is a priority site under the Government’s contaminated sites programme. We are committed to cleaning-up this waterway as quickly and as safely as possible,” Ms Adams says.

The additional funding will be used to remove about 40,000 cubic metres of contaminated sediment from the canal. The sediment will be stored and treated in secure containment cells.

The Kopeopeo Canal was originally built to allow drainage and floodwaters from low lying farmland into the Whakatane Estuary. However, between 1950 and 1989 the canal was contaminated by dioxins from a local sawmill.

The project is being managed by the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, which has provided $2.4 million towards the clean-up.

Ms Adams says cleaning up New Zealand’s contaminated sites is a priority for the Government.

Since 2008, more than $28 million has been invested to clean up contaminated sites throughout New Zealand. As well as Kopeopeo Canal, this also includes Tui Mine, the Patea Freezing Works, Minginui sawmill and dump, and the Waiwhetu Stream.

The Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund provides money for the investigation, remedial planning and remediation of sites that pose a risk to human health and the environment.
