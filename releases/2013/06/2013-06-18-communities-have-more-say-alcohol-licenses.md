Justice Minister Judith Collins says local communities now have a greater say in the availability of alcohol in their neighbourhoods.

Giving communities greater scope to object to liquor licence applications is the first step in the implementation of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012.

“Many New Zealanders are concerned by the misuse of alcohol in our society and the damage they see it causing,” Ms Collins says.

“This Government has given communities the tools they need to challenge unwanted bars, bottle stores and other licensed premises and stop them from setting-up in particular parts of their neighbourhoods.”

From today people can oppose a liquor license application if they believe the location of a licensed premise will negatively impact the surrounding neighbourhood, including the increase of noise levels or vandalism.

Previously people could only object to someone obtaining a liquor licence on their suitability to hold a license, and proposed trading hours.

Ms Collins says the implementation of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act is only part of creating lasting change to New Zealand’s drinking culture.

“This Government recognises that social change cannot be achieved through legislation alone. We are all responsible for reducing alcohol-related harm and for changing our drinking culture. We all have a part to play.”
