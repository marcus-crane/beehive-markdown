The Education Amendment Bill 2012 passed its Third Reading in Parliament today, amending the Education Act 1989.

Education Minister Hon Hekia Parata says the Bill will help all students to realise their potential.

“The provisions in the Bill will help equip New Zealanders with the qualifications and skills they need to make a successful contribution to our society and economy.”

“On search, surrender and retention, we have provided a clear framework to ensure schools can maintain a safe learning environment at all times.

“Our teachers will now be guided by law when they encounter a situation where they may require a student to hand over potentially harmful material. This Bill considers the safety of our teachers and of the students.”

The Bill also makes provision for Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua.

“Now the legislation is in place, I look forward to considering which of the applicants are most likely to achieve success as Partnership Schools.

“Partnership Schools provide a new approach to making the education system work for all young people, particularly for our vulnerable children.

“The range of applications we have received has been impressive, and I look forward to seeing the first schools open at the start of the next school year.”

This Bill also establishes the primary responsibility of Boards of Trustees as ensuring all students achieve their highest possible educational standards.

“Boards of Trustees up and down the country are dedicated to the vital job of governing our schools. I am pleased that the legislation acknowledges this by emphasising an unwavering focus on student learning and achievement.”

“New Zealand has a world leading education system, and we must strive to ensure that every student benefits from it. With the passing of the Bill, we have more tools and fewer obstacles to raising educational achievement for all New Zealand students.”

 

**Notes:**

**Partnership schools**

· The Bill creates the legal framework for a third type of school within the schooling network: Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua. The other two types of schools are State schools (including State integrated schools) and private schools.

· Partnership Schools are one of a number of new initiatives targeted towards addressing educational underachievement. The Bill provides parents and students with another option to choose from, when considering the most appropriate type of education for the student’s particular needs.

· Under the Bill, Partnership Schools will have more flexibility to make decisions about how they operate and use funding to deliver specific school level targets. Partnership Schools will be subject to strict accountability for improving educational outcomes.

· Partnership Schools will have a sponsor that the Minister of Education will approve to operate the school. The sponsor will sign a contract with the Crown that sets out the responsibilities and obligations of both parties.

**Search, surrender and retention**

· The Bill creates appropriate legal powers of search, surrender and retention which can be used in the schooling context.

· The objectives are to:

o provide schools with powers which contribute toward learning environments that are both safe and conducive to positive student achievement;

o balance the needs of teachers to effectively manage their students and provide safe learning environments, with the rights of students to be free from unreasonable search and seizure; and

o prohibit methods of search and seizure that are considered to be overly intrusive and invasive, and which are either inappropriate for the effective management of students, or unnecessary for ensuring student safety.

· Under the Bill:

o A teacher or authorised staff member (e.g. a school guidance counsellor) will be able to require a student to hand over any item, including an electronic device, which is likely to endanger the safety of any person or detrimentally affect the learning environment

o A teacher or authorised staff member will be able to confiscate items for a reasonable period, and either return or dispose of them (as appropriate)

o Where a student refuses to hand over a harmful item which is concealed in clothing, or a bag or other container, the teacher or authorised staff member can require the student to:

§ remove their outer clothing, or any head covering, gloves, footwear, and socks for searching; or

§ surrender the bag or container for searching.

o A search must be carried out with decency and sensitivity, and in a manner that affords the student the greatest degree of privacy and dignity consistent with the purpose of the search. Unless impracticable, the search must:

§ be carried out by a teacher or authorised staff member who is of the same sex as the student;

§ be carried out in the presence of the student and another teacher or authorised staff member who is of the same sex as the student; and

§ not be carried out in the view of any other person.

o Where a student refuses to comply with a teacher’s instruction, the teacher or authorised staff member will be able to take any disciplinary steps, or steps to manage the student’s behaviour, as the teacher considers reasonable

o Contractors will not be able to exercise any of the permitted search, surrender and retention powers, or search a student. However, schools will be able to engage contractors to conduct searches of school property through the use of dogs

o A teacher or authorised staff member will be able to encourage students to participate in a voluntary drug treatment programme that involves testing of bodily samples

o A teacher or an authorised staff member will be prohibited from:

- - physically searching a student;
  - using physical force against a student;
  - requiring a student to provide a bodily sample; and
  - having a dog present for the purpose of exercising a permitted search or seizure power

o The Secretary for Education will be required to issue rules and guidelines for the sector, covering the practical aspects of the new search and seizure regime. These will come into force at the same time as the relevant provisions in the Bill (1 January 2014).
