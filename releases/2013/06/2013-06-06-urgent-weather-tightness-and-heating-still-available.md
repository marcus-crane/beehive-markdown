With winter upon us Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee is reminding greater Christchurch residents that EQC can still authorise urgent repairs in certain circumstances.

“EQC can authorise urgent repairs if a house is unsafe, unsanitary or not sufficiently weatherproof, provided this arises from earthquake damage,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We threw huge resources into identifying who needed urgent repairs and had lost their primary heat sources following the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes, and since then EQC has undertaken more than 47,000 urgent repairs and installed 19,000 heat pumps and woodburners.

“These are additional to and entirely separate from the more than 38,000 full home repairs that have also been completed.”

Mr Brownlee says it’s important that no one is left with leaky roofs or without heating over winter as a result of earthquake damage.

“I’m confident we covered off most people with urgent requirements two winters ago or last winter, but still we see occasional cases where people have been putting up with houses that aren’t weather-tight, probably unaware this emergency repair service exists.

“It’s important that people whose homes need urgent work get it done before winter really sets in.”

Mr Brownlee says EQC is also working to help those most vulnerable by prioritising their repairs where possible.

“If you have an EQC damage claim and you or someone in your home has a serious medical condition and is dependent on a carer, or is over 80 years of age, please call EQC.

“In these circumstances, EQC may be able to push the repair ahead in the schedule, so long as there aren’t factors that prevent an early repair,” Mr Brownlee says.

If you have quake-related weather-tightness issues or lost your primary heat source in any of the Christchurch earthquakes, please call EQC on 0800 DAMAGE (0800 326 243).
