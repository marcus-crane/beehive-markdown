Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the three-week-old Residential Advisory Service is making strong progress, with 113 cases having been booked for appointments with independent advisers.

“Since its launch on May 16 the service has received 386 phone calls and emails, resulting in 113 initial appointments with property owners being made, 104 of which have already been held.

“These appointments may lead to a range of steps, including the gathering of more technical advice or facilitated meetings with parties involved in the property owner’s issues.

“What I’m confident of, given the attitude of all parties involved in and supporting the Residential Advisory Service, is that the general result for property owners will be progress and resolution,” Mr Brownlee says.

Another 168 of the approaches to the service by phone and email have proven more suitable for referral to other agencies and services, with the remainder having been call-backs, changes of appointment or general enquiries.
