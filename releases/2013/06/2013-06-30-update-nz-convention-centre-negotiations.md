The Government and SkyCity Entertainment Group have extended to Friday, 5 July the timeframe for negotiation of the final agreement to design, build and operate the $402 million New Zealand International Convention Centre.

“We have made good progress on an agreement that runs to a few hundred pages, and it makes sense to take a few more days to ensure all details are sorted,” Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

On 14 June the timeframe under the Heads of Agreement was extended to 30 June. The parties today agreed to extend the period for negotiating the final agreement to 11pm, 5 July.
