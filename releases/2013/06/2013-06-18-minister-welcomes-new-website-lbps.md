Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says the launch of a new website will make it easier for Licensed Building Practitioners to access information online.

The [www.lbp.govt.nz](http://www.lbp.govt.nz) site also provides information for New Zealanders wanting to find the right people for building and renovation work.

“This website will act as a one stop shop and provide crucial information for those in the industry and the public.”

The Licenced Building Practitioners scheme was established in late 2007 to improve and formally recognise the skills and competence of building practitioners.

LBPs are designers, carpenters, bricklayers, roofers, external plasterers, site and foundations specialists who have been assessed competent to carryout work essential to a residential building’s structure or weathertightness.

There are currently 23,000 LBPs in New Zealand accountable to the Building Practitioners Board.
