Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide a further $1.7 million to help those displaced by the conflict in Syria.

“New Zealanders continue to be appalled by the on-going death and destruction in Syria,” Mr McCully says

“The number of Syrian refuges in neighbouring countries has reportedly reached over 1.4 million, placing massive strain on the region.

“New Zealand is committed to supporting those forced from their homes by the fighting and continues to call for urgent international action to end the conflict.”

The latest funding will go toward a joint project with the Government of Turkey to build three schools in refugee camps, and for food assistance delivered by the World Food Programme for Syrian refugees in Jordan.

New Zealand has previously provided $3 million to support refugee populations in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, as well as those displaced within Syria.
