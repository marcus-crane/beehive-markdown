A new energy rating scheme launched today could help lift energy efficiency in New Zealand commercial buildings by as much as 25 percent, says Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges.

Speaking at the launch of NABERSNZ, Mr Bridges said the voluntary rating system aims to transform the way office buildings use energy.

“Commercial buildings use 21 percent of New Zealand’s electricity, costing business $800 million every year.  On average, building energy performance could be improved by 20-25 percent,” says Mr Bridges.

NABERSNZ, developed in partnership with the New Zealand Green Building Council with assistance from the business community, is modelled on a similar system in Australia.

The scheme rates commercial building energy use on a scale of one to six, with certified ratings being issued on the level of energy performance.

“It’s expected that in time, the system will become the industry-recognised benchmark for energy performance in office buildings, similar to the energy star mark used for electronic products and appliances,” says Mr Bridges.

“There is considerable scope for better energy use in our commercial buildings and the NABERSNZ scheme is a good incentive to raise performance, helping New Zealand businesses to become more productive.”
