Relocating government agencies back into the Christchurch CBD is a step closer says Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman.

“The public sector will be locating facilities in the heart of the city as an integral part of delivering the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Moving government agencies back into the CBD is part of the government’s commitment to the revitalisation of Christchurch.”

Dr Coleman says the Crown has received a good response to the call for proposals for public sector office accommodation in the CBD.

“The government’s Property Management Centre of Expertise has been working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) to meet the priorities and challenges of the re-build, and initiated the Christchurch accommodation project.

“This project aims to provide long term office accommodation solutions for government agencies in Christchurch and will help boost the development of the city centre,” Dr Coleman says.

“There are currently 20 government agencies involved in the project and the process remains on track to select preferred suppliers in the third quarter of 2013.”

The Property Management Centre of Expertise is also looking at ways to improve the delivery of government services through the co-location of agencies which encourages greater collaboration between agencies.

“The government has strengthened the role of Property Management Centre of Expertise to manage public sector office accommodation in a more effective and efficient way,” Dr Coleman says.
