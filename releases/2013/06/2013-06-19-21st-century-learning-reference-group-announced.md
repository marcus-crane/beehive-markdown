Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye has today announced 14 members of a new reference group that will provide expert advice on 21st century learning environments and digital literacy in schools.

“The group will be chaired by Brett O’Riley and includes people who are proven leaders in technology and education,” Ms Kaye says.

“It has been important to me to have people from a diverse range of backgrounds at the table.”

Taking account of the recommendations of the select committee enquiry and Government response into 21st century learning environments and digital literacy, the 21st Century Learning Reference Group will work on a strategy for learning that enables schools to make the best use of modern technologies.

“The Government has already rolled out a number of initiatives, including allocating $134 million to speed up school network upgrades by two years and the provision of wireless capability to schools,” Ms Kaye says.

“Other initiatives that have been progressed include enhancing the role of information science in the education sector, the development of 21st century building design templates and initiatives to tackle cyber bullying.

“This group will be tasked with exploring ways to provide every student and educator, in both rural and urban New Zealand, with the knowledge, skills and abilities required for the 21st century.

“I will be asking the group to prioritise particular areas of work such as improving device access and the development of 21st century skills.

“With the increasing number of schools adopting device polices and many progressing Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), it will be important to ensure that children from low income families also have access to online learning opportunities.

“We are investing significantly in the roll out of ultra-fast broadband fibre, school network infrastructure and a managed network for schools. These initiatives will make a real difference as a new platform for effective teaching and learning practices in schools.”

By 2016 all schools in New Zealand will have increased access to digital learning opportunities – 97.7% of schools will have fibre connections, and the most remote schools (2.3%) will have wireless or satellite connections. In addition, all eligible schools will have their school networks upgraded and the option to connect to a managed network for schools.

“When the group meets later this month I will be confirming their task is to deliver a strategy that will enhance learning and educational achievement,” Ms Kaye says.
