Trade Minister Tim Groser has announced that the third CER-ASEAN Integration Partnership Forum will take place in Cairns, Australia, on 18 June.

The annual Integration Partnership Forum is aimed at sharing the lessons from the Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER) between New Zealand and Australia with the wider ASEAN membership.

“New Zealand and Australia have two of the most integrated economies in the world, and for more than 30 years CER has been helping to drive growth and trade on both sides of the Tasman,” says Mr Groser. “We want to share our experience of CER and its benefits with the ASEAN countries.

“This year’s meeting will focus on the CER approach to competition policy and how we can build on the success of the 2009 ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement.

“ASEAN members have set an ambitious timetable for establishing an ASEAN Economic Community and developing robust competition policies across the ten Member States will be vital to meeting the 2015 deadline.

“New Zealand and Australia have their own national competition policy regimes, but we have worked closely on coordination and enforcement to help create a predictable and competitive environment for business. We hope that sharing our approach to this challenging issue will provide ASEAN members with some useful ideas.

“We are supportive of the benefits greater regional economic integration will deliver across the ASEAN membership, including for New Zealand and Australia,” Mr Groser says.
