Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse has acknowledged World Refugee Day, held every year on 20 June. This year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) theme is ‘1 family torn apart by conflict is too many’.

“World Refugee Day provides an opportunity to come together to commemorate the journey of all refugees around the world, and to celebrate the contribution that refugee communities have made to our country,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“Our annual refugee quota of 750 refugees is a reflection of the government’s commitment to fulfilling its international humanitarian obligations and responsibilities to provide protection to refugees.”

“Since we began resettling young Polish refugees in 1944, approximately 34,000 refugees have come to our shores to seek a brighter future. New Zealand can be rightly proud of its contribution over the years to providing solutions to the world’s refugee problem,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The Government also recognises that the challenges of the refugee journey do not end with refugees’ arrival in New Zealand. All refugees spend their first six weeks at Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre, and it was pleasing to announce last month that the Centre is to undergo a $15 million rebuild.”

Mr Woodhouse says that last year the government confirmed its commitment to refugee resettlement with its agreement to the Refugee Resettlement Strategy.

“The strategy focuses on improving outcomes for refugees, so that they more quickly achieve self-sufficiency, social integration and independence, and is seen internationally as world best practice,” Mr Woodhouse says.

World Refugee Day is marked in more than 100 countries. For more information visit: [www.worldrefugeeday.org.nz](http://www.worldrefugeeday.org.nz)
