Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced that money seized from drug crime will be allocated to Government agencies to directly fight crime and drug addiction.

“As part of our 2009 Methamphetamine Action Plan, we made a commitment that money taken from those who profit from drugs would be used to hit the drug trade and reduce the harm from drugs,” Ms Collins says.

“We’re sending a clear message that this Government is serious about tackling drugs, particularly methamphetamine, and the harm they cause in our communities.”

The Government has received about $8.3 million since the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act came into force in December 2009.

Key agencies such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Corrections will now bid for funding for drug treatment projects and the New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Customs Service will bid for funding for law enforcement initiatives.

Bids will be assessed by the Inter-Agency Committee on Drugs (IACD), who will then advise the government on the best programmes to fund.

Ms Collins says the Government remains committed to fighting crime and drug dependency.

“We must ensure our law enforcement agencies have the support they need to continue to break drug supply chains and tackle organised criminal groups dealing in this anti-social behaviour,” Ms Collins says.
