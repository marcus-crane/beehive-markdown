New Zealand health services continue to monitor the avian influenza situation in China and the novel coronavirus in the Middle East – and remain ready to respond should advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) change.

Current WHO advice is that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission and WHO does not advise travel restrictions or special border screening.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said New Zealand has testing capability for these viruses and pandemic plans which can be activated quickly if advice changes.

“The Director General of Health, Kevin Woods, has recently returned from the World Health Assembly in Geneva where he attended a joint briefing by WHO and the Chinese Health Minister about avian influenza,” says Mr Ryall.

“Dr Woods has advised me the avian influenza outbreak in China appears to have been contained but continuing vigilance is necessary as the virus can cause serious respiratory illness. The virus is thought to have occurred as a result of exposure to infected poultry.”

Since February 2013 there have been 132 confirmed cases of avian influenza in China, including 37 fatalities. There has been only one new case of human infection with avian influenza reported in China since 8 May 2013.

“The Ministry of Health is also continuing to monitor reports overseas on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),” says Mr Ryall.

“Sustained person to person transmission has not occurred, but as with avian influenza there is a continuing need for close monitoring of this new virus.”

A total of 53 confirmed cases of human infection with the coronavirus have been notified to the WHO since September 2012 including 30 deaths from nine countries – France, Tunisia, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and United Kingdom.
