Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has announced the new appointment of Michael Barnett and the reappointment of Susan Peterson as members of the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW) for terms of three years beginning 1 July 2013.

NACEW provides independent advice to the Minister of Women’s Affairs on matters related to women’s employment.

“I congratulate Mr Barnett on his appointment. He will bring insights on the needs of New Zealand employers to NACEW’s work and his experience as chair of the Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) Trust will also be invaluable,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“I look forward to Ms Peterson’s continued involvement with NACEW and congratulate her on her reappointment.

“I also acknowledge the valuable contribution made by Ranjna Patel during her term as a NACEW member and thank her for her service.”

Michael Barnett is Chief Executive of the Auckland Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a Director of the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He has also held roles on the boards of Willis NZ and International Risk Management Consultants and Insurance Brokers.

Susan Peterson has served as a ministerial appointee on NACEW since September 2010. She is an independent director, the former General Manager of Wealth Business and Performance at ANZ and an IHC New Zealand board member.

The other members of NACEW are Traci Houpapa (chair), Galia BarHava-Monteith (deputy chair), Dr Airini, Norah Barlow, Barbara Burton, Suzanne McNabb and Lynette Olsthoorn.
