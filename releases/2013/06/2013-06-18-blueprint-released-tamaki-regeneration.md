The draft strategic framework for the housing-led regeneration of Tāmaki has today been released for public feedback by Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith, Auckland Mayor Len Brown and the Tāmaki Redevelopment Company.

“Our ambition is to transform the Tāmaki area over the next 25 years into a thriving and prosperous community with better educational opportunities, more people having jobs, and improved health and recreational facilities. This will only be achieved if we take the people with us, which is why we are consulting with the community on this draft blueprint,” Dr Smith says.

“A significant part of the regeneration programme is focused on housing. Fifty seven per cent of the existing 5000 properties are owned by Housing New Zealand and too many are old, cold and mouldy and are of the wrong size and in the wrong place. This draft blueprint sets out a vision of providing up to 6000 additional homes in the area with a better mix of social, affordable and market housing.

“This massive urban regeneration programme is a first for New Zealand in scale and approach. The model is based on world best practice of similar urban re-developments. It is being progressed in partnership with the Auckland Council and is deliberately focused on not just housing, but all of the components like education, employment and recreation that are needed for a more successful community.”

Auckland Mayor Len Brown welcomed the release of the draft framework.

“The local community, and Auckland as a whole, have been working towards a plan for the regeneration of Tamaki for a number of years. The challenge now is to ensure new homes and economic development are delivered in a way that supports the aspirations of local residents and builds strong and resilient communities,” Mr Brown says.

“This is a new model for Auckland and for New Zealand, and along with central government we believe it is a great opportunity to deliver more affordable homes to meet the needs of the local community.”

Chair of the Tāmaki Redevelopment Company Martin Udale says the release of the strategic framework is an important opportunity to check that the company’s vision for Tāmaki (Panmure, Glen Innes and Point England) meets the community’s aspirations.

“The community has played an integral part in developing this vision for Tāmaki’s regeneration over the past five years. In order for us to deliver on that vision, we need to check back with our stakeholders to see whether we have captured their collective aspirations and priorities for their families,” Mr Udale says.

“We acknowledge that from a community of around 18,000 residents, there are going to be differing views as to what progress might look like. We are committed to getting out and about and providing opportunities for active participation of local residents in shaping decisions affecting their future. With 30 per cent of our residents under the age of 15 years our team will work hard to ensure the voices of our young people are heard.

“I urge residents to read and provide feedback on the draft document. However, this period of engagement is only the start and the company will continue to work with the community to deliver on their vision for Tāmaki.”

The Tāmaki Redevelopment Company was formed by the Government and Auckland Council in July last year. The Government contributed $5 million to help establish the company and the Auckland Council contributed $3.5 million.

Shareholding Ministers will consider a business case from the Tāmaki Redevelopment Company on the regeneration opportunities later this year.

Feedback on the draft strategic framework closes on 19 July. Further information can be found at [www.tamakitrc.co.nz](http://www.tamakitrc.co.nz)
