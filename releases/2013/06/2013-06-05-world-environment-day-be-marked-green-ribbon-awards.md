Environment Minister Amy Adams says tonight’s Green Ribbon Awards, recognising the positive difference that communities are making to the environment, are a great way to mark World Environment Day.

Ms Adams will host the awards ceremony at Parliament tonight. Eleven category winners will be announced, before a Supreme Winner is revealed. The awards recognise the outstanding contributions made by organisations, businesses and communities to protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment.

Being held for the 24th time, this year’s awards had more than 200 entries from 46 towns and cities. The finalists cover areas such as caring for water, minimising waste, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and business leadership.

“World Environment Day is an ideal occasion to show the human face of environmental issues, and promote the fantastic work that is happening in our communities,” Ms Adams says.

“The Green Ribbon finalists are a diverse group of people. They come from a range of backgrounds and the work they do is challenging, time-consuming and sometimes unrewarded.

“Tackling environmental issues is not easy. It takes initiative and dedication, and the awards pay tribute to the incredible work being undertaken all over New Zealand to address the environmental challenges we face.

“The panel of judges faced a tough task picking the finalists and winners from amongst a high quality field of contenders.”

This year, the United Nations theme for World Environment Day is an anti-food waste and food loss campaign, encouraging everyone to reduce their food print.

In previous years, the Green Ribbon Awards have recognised organisations that model this theme. The 2011 supreme winner – Eco Stock Supplies – is turning waste food into high quality food product for livestock, while last year, Wellington’s Kaibosh Food Rescue was a finalist in the minimising waste category.
