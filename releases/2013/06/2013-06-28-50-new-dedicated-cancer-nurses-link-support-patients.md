Health Minister Tony Ryall has today welcomed four more cancer care nurses appointed as part of the Government’s $4 million a year programme to give cancer patients in every district health board dedicated support and coordinated care.

“I would like to congratulate all 50 new cancer nurse coordinators on the difference they are already making to patients and their families,” Mr Ryall says,” and I warmly welcome the four new Canterbury DHB cancer nurses to the programme.”

Mr Ryall is attending the inaugural Cancer Nurse Coordinator Forum in Wellington where the new nurses from around the country are setting up national and regional networks and links to provide coordinated support and advocacy for cancer patients.

“Families can understandably become confused and overwhelmed when one of their own is diagnosed with cancer.

“And if that’s not hard enough, then they have to negotiate their way through a complex maze of tests, appointments, treatments, and services.

“Research shows some cancer patients can come into contact with up to 28 doctors, and even more nurses, throughout their treatment.”

“But one dedicated cancer nurse coordinator can help a patient and their family navigate their way through the system,” Mr Ryall says.

Natalie James, National Nurse Lead of the Cancer Nurse Coordinator Initiative, says the aim is to have dedicated cancer nurses acting as a single point of contact and assisting patients and their families across different parts of the health service.

“Nurses are already making connections with patients in their regions and working with them as the patients start the complex cancer journey,” Ms James says.

“Many have already received positive feedback from patients in their communities.”

“This more personalised service will mean better treatment and a less stressful experience for patients,” Mr Ryall says.
