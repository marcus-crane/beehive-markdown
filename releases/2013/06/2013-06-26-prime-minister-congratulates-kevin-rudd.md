Prime Minister John Key tonight congratulated Kevin Rudd on his elevation to the leadership of the Australian Labor Party and acknowledged outgoing Leader Julia Gillard.

“I will be passing on my congratulations to Kevin Rudd as soon as I can,” says Mr Key.

"The relationship with Australia is our closest and most important, and I look forward to working with Kevin Rudd in continuing our cooperation across the trade, economic, defence and security spheres.

“I enjoyed a close working relationship with Kevin Rudd in his past roles as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and I look forward to that continuing.

"I would also like to acknowledge Julia Gillard’s commitment to the trans-Tasman relationship during her time as Prime Minister.

“She has been a good friend to New Zealand and I have always looked forward to our discussions and appreciated her hospitality during my visits to Australia.

“The bonds between our two countries will remain strong and we will continue our important work on achieving a Single Economic Market, as well as cooperating closely on the regional and international stage."
