An initiative to speed up the time it takes to get urgent Family Court applications in front of judges has been rolled out to all Family Courts across the country.

Courts Minister Chester Borrows says the initiative, called e-Duty, links judges around the country so that an e-Duty judge can immediately review and decide on urgent applications to the Family Court for things like orders to protect children or vulnerable people.

Previously the applicant would need to wait for a judge to become available in the court where the application was made. Using existing technology and systems, e-Duty cuts the time it takes for a decision to be made on these to less than an hour, instead of up to half a day.

“People make these types of applications at a very vulnerable time in their lives so speeding up the process means that they can feel safer, sooner,” says Mr Borrows.

“This is a great example of how the courts are able to use modern technology to deliver a better service for court users.”

e-Duty was developed in 2010 by Hamilton-based Family Court Judge Noel Cocurullo and local Ministry of Justice court staff after they identified that the paper-based system they were working with took too long. After initially being rolled out with great success in the Waikato, e-Duty is now available across the country, with the support of Principal Family Court Judge Laurence Ryan.

Six Family Court judges will be available to review e-Duty cases each day, and in most cases be able to make decisions within an hour of the proceeding being received.

“eDuty shows how we can make smarter use of existing tools and resources to improve the way our courts work. I want to congratulate Judge Cocurullo and the Hamilton court staff for their inventiveness and hard work in making eDuty a reality,” says Mr Borrows.
