Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says a new nationwide reintegration programme for prisoners will help reduce reoffending and result in fewer victims of crime.

Budget 2013 made $10 million available over two years from the Justice Sector Fund to establish the new “Out of Gate” programme, which is aimed at steering offenders away from a return to crime.

The post-release service will support prisoners as soon as they leave a facility, at a time when they quickly need to readjust to life outside the wire.

Up to 4000 prisoners, serving sentences of less than two years, will be allocated a dedicated provider who will connect them to social service agencies and help with accommodation, employment and general living skills.

“Prisoners are at risk of returning to crime as soon as they step out of the prison gate,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We are putting a huge effort into giving offenders education and training opportunities, alongside drug and alcohol rehabilitation. But we don’t want all of that great work undone within a few days of their release, at what can be a crucial time for many offenders.

“By guiding prisoners back into life outside prison, and giving them every opportunity to stay crime-free, we can help turn their lives around, and stop them creating more victims of crime.

“This common-sense nationwide approach follows discussions between Corrections and justice sector groups, with implementation due to begin in September 2013.

“The programme will be evaluated as we go along, to ensure that it is effective in helping us reach our target of a 25 per cent reduction in reoffending by 2017.”

A Request for Proposals from interested service providers will go out from Corrections today.
