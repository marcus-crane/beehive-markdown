Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the 2013 Financial Knowledge and Behaviour survey at the Financial Literacy Summit in Auckland today.

“Improving financial literacy is vitally important. The study launched today shows that while New Zealanders have the knowledge to make good financial decisions; they often do not act on this knowledge. Many continue to make poor decisions when it comes to their personal finances,” says Mr Foss.

The 2013 Financial Literacy Summit is hosted by the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income, which is headed by the Retirement Commissioner, Diane Maxwell. With more than 300 delegates it is New Zealand’s largest Financial Literacy Summit.

“The Government is focused on providing regulatory settings that enable investors, businesses and consumers to make the best choices and achieve the right outcomes when it comes to saving, investment, and credit,” says Mr Foss. 

The survey was undertaken by the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income with the support of ANZ. It involved 852 face-to-face interviews. The Colmar Brunton survey was a follow up to similar surveys in 2009 and 2005.
