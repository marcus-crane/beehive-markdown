Commerce Minister Craig Foss today released a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to strengthen the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill.

The Bill tightens New Zealand’s companies and limited partnerships registration regime and addresses misuse by overseas entities.

“The changes I am introducing today implement the Commerce Select Committee’s recommendations to give the Registrar of Companies more power to identify the true owner of a company,” says Mr Foss.

The SOP gives the Registrar powers to enquire about:

- Individuals controlling companies and limited partnerships;
- individuals controlling directors and general partners; and
- individuals that directors and general partners may have delegated their powers to.

“The Registrar will be able to use these powers to assist with the detection, investigation and prosecution of serious crimes, including money laundering and tax fraud, and share this information with other enforcement agencies,” says Mr Foss.

The SOP also amends the schemes and amalgamations provisions for companies and the offences for serious breaches of certain directors’ duties.

“The changes in relation to directors’ duties follow substantial consultation with key stakeholders. They strike the right balance between holding to account directors who irresponsibly breach their duties and cause serious loss while still allowing for legitimate risk-taking,” says Mr Foss.

Progressing the Bill is part of the government’s Business Growth Agenda to improve regulation and lift confidence in New Zealand’s capital markets.
