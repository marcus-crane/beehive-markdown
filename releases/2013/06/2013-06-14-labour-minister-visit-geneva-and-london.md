Employment relations and workplace health and safety are key areas of discussion for Labour Minister Simon Bridges when he attends the International Labour Conference in Geneva next week.

The Minister will address a plenary session on this year’s theme of ‘Building a Future with Decent Work’, meet with political counterparts and senior ILO officials and attend a meeting of Asia Pacific Labour Ministers.

“This is an important opportunity to meet with other Labour Ministers and learn from each other’s experiences. I am particularly keen to discuss New Zealand’s on-going investment in improving the practice and culture of health and safety in our workplaces,” says Mr Bridges.

In London, the Minister will hold bilateral talks with his British counterparts for Energy and for Labour, and meet with the British health and safety regulator, the Health and Safety Executive.

He will also visit Olympic Park with health and safety expert Lawrence Waterman OBE.

“We can learn important lessons for the Christchurch rebuild from the excellent health and safety performance throughout the 2012 Olympic build, and the conversion of the facilities into a permanent site. I am keen to take a closer look at this project,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Bridges leaves for Europe tomorrow.
