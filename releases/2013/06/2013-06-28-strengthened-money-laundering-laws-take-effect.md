New laws strengthening New Zealand’s financial system against serious crime take effect from this Sunday 30 June.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the [Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2009/0035/latest/DLM2140720.html) (AML/CFT Act) will make New Zealand safer by helping law enforcement agencies detect and deter serious crimes such as drug dealing, tax evasion and fraud.

“The new AML/CFT regime will make it easier to recover money gained illegally and help close the loopholes that criminals can use to launder money,” Ms Collins says.

“It also aligns New Zealand with international laws and best practice and increases our trading partners’ confidence in our financial sector.”

The Act applies to a range of businesses classified as reporting entities such as banks, other financial institutions, some financial advisors and casinos.

Reporting entities have had since 2009 to implement the required changes, which include [checking and verifying](http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/criminal-justice/aml-cft/information-for-businesses#what-is-customer-due) customers’ identities, [assessing the risks](http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/criminal-justice/aml-cft/information-for-businesses#what-is-an-aml) the business faces, adopting an [AML/CFT programme](http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/criminal-justice/aml-cft/information-for-businesses#what-is-an-aml-1), appointing a [compliance officer](http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/criminal-justice/aml-cft/information-for-businesses#what-is-an-aml-2) and reporting suspicious or unusual transactions.

Ms Collins says the new law is part of a co-ordinated international effort to tackle a serious global problem and New Zealand is putting in place systems that mirror those in other countries.

“Being in step with the rest of the world is crucial to New Zealand as a trading nation, as more authorities around the world are requiring compliance with AML/CFT standards,” Ms Collins says.

“The new laws don’t just help fight crime and terrorism; they also reflect sound practices that reduce financial risks for businesses while also protecting the savings and interests of their customers and investors.”

The Ministry of Justice is responsible for administering the AML/CFT Act. Three government agencies - the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Financial Markets Authority and the Department of Internal Affairs are responsible for supervising, monitoring and enforcing the AML/CFT regime.
