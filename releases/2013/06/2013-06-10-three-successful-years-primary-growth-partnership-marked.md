Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy have marked three years of the Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) at a function at Parliament tonight.

“The PGP invests in research and innovation to boost productivity in New Zealand’s farming, forestry and food sectors,” Mr Guy says. “This will mean more exports, jobs and better environmental outcomes as well.”

“The Government and industry have so far committed $658 million of multi-year funding for 13 projects.  The potential benefit to the wider economy from these projects is over $7 billion per year from 2025.

“Some examples of current projects include red meat sector collaboration, manuka honey trials, harvesting trees from steep land, improving the precision of seafood catches, and selective breeding of greenshell mussels.

“These investments in productivity will play a big part in achieving the Government’s goal of doubling primary exports by 2025,” says Mr Guy. 

“Science and innovation are key drivers of economic growth and international competitiveness,” Mr Joyce says. “The PGP programme is crucial for New Zealand to maximise the value of our primary sector exports through greater investment in innovation.

“The Government is now investing hundreds of millions annually in business R & D across all sectors, including food and beverage manufacturing, digital technologies, health technologies, hi-tech manufacturing, and agri-technologies.”

Overall, the Government’s total cross-portfolio funding for science, innovation and research has increased 28 per cent over the last four years, up to $1.36 billion in 2013/14.

Mr Guy also announced a change of chairperson for the Investment Advisory Panel for the Primary Growth Partnership.

Chair Bill Falconer is standing down from 31 July and will be replaced by current panel member Joanna Perry.

"I want to thank Bill Falconer who has brought commercial acumen and passion to this important role.

"The Investment Advisory Panel is a crucial part of the success of PGP. The Panel brings commercial and boardroom experience which it has diligently applied to the PGP investment process,” says Mr Guy.

The latest round of PGP is now open for funding applications. Further information is available at: [http://www.mpi.govt.nz/agriculture/funding-programmes/primary-growth-partnership.aspx](http://www.mpi.govt.nz/agriculture/funding-programmes/primary-growth-partnership.aspx)
