The future health of some of New Zealand’s iconic lakes is being enhanced through a significant programme of lake weed control work, says Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson.

“Carried out by Land Information New Zealand, the work programme represents an on-going government investment of more than $600,000 per year in the control of lagarosiphon and hornwort in specific New Zealand lakes.”

Originally used by the aquarium trade, lagarosiphon was first noticed in the Rotorua lakes in the 1950s. An unwanted organism, which is capable of choking waterways, smothering native aquatic plant communities and establishing quickly if untreated, has gradually appeared in many lakes.

Hornwort is a submerged freshwater weed that rapidly invades water of varying clarity, temperature, light and nutrient level. Its dense growth crowds out native species and impedes irrigation, drainage and other water uses.

“Both species of weed represent a very real threat to the health of New Zealand’s lakes.

“Lake Wanaka is a good example of there being noticeably less lagarosiphon this year when compared to 2012. A combination of suction dredging, hand weeding and herbicide control has been used by divers at the lake,” Mr Williamson says.

Land Information New Zealand, in collaboration with community groups, councils and others, has in the past year had work programmes in place at Lakes Okataina, Rotoehu, Tarawera, Rerewhakaaitu, Rotoma, Rotoiti, Rotorua, Okareka, Benmore, Wanaka and Dunstan.

“The work of LINZ and others is enhancing those lakes for the enjoyment of all New Zealanders.”
