Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy is flying to China tonight, leading an agribusiness trade mission.

The trip is formally hosted by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and the delegation will visit Beijing, Shanghai, and the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Anhui.

“This is a valuable opportunity to match New Zealand agribusiness companies with business opportunities. Of particular interest is pasture and animal husbandry expertise, general agricultural services, and the construction of dairy farms,” says Mr Guy.

“As part of the trip a New Zealand business event will be held in Beijing where members of the business delegation will present to Chinese businesses and officials with a range of commercial interests. The programme also includes a visit to a Fonterra Yutian farm in Hebei province.

“This trip follows Prime Minister John Key’s very successful visit to China in April, during which President Xi and Premier Li identified agricultural science and technology as among China’s priorities for further cooperation.

“The visit to Beijing also provides the opportunity to follow-up on Chinese Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu’s visit to New Zealand in April, and the Strategic Plan on Promoting Agricultural Cooperation signed by Ministers during that visit.

“New Zealand and China have a very strong trading relationship, particularly in meat and dairy products, and this visit will build on that. In April this year China overtook Australia to officially become our largest export market.”

There will be 13 members of the New Zealand trade delegation, including AsureQuality Ltd, CRV Ambreed New Zealand, Livestock Improvement Corporation, Fonterra Cooperative Group Limited, Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd (ESR), Gallagher Group Limited, MilkTest New Zealand, Taranaki Dairy Technologies, Landcorp, Massey University, and PGG Wrightson Seeds.

Mr Guy returns to New Zealand on 7 July.
