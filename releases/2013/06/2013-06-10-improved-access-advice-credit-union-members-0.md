Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced that low-risk credit union savings accounts and term deposits would be re-categorised to improve access to financial advice. The changes come into force today.

The move will cut regulation, allowing all types of financial advisers to provide personalised advice on these simple products.

“As these products are low-risk and easier for consumers to understand, the current regulatory requirements are unnecessary. The cost of adhering to the current requirements is preventing some credit unions from advising their member on how to best meet their savings goals.

“The change in category will improve credit union members’ access to financial advice and encourage them to improve their levels of savings and investment. Consumers can continue to access to free disputes resolution services, in the event that they are unhappy with the advice they receive.

“The Government is focused on making sure that levels of regulation are appropriate and consistent across the board,” says Mr Foss.

The re-categorisation of some credit union advice is part of the government’s Business Growth Agenda commitment to lift the rate of national savings.

The changes will come into force through regulations made under the Financial Advisers Act 2008.
