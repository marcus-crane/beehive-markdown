Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says the 2013 Fieldays has reinforced just how important the primary industries are to New Zealand’s economy.

“125,127 people attended this year’s event at Mystery Creek and the overall mood was very positive. It was an honour to open the 45th National Fieldays, an event that attracted nearly 700 international visitors and 22 delegations keen to learn from New Zealand.

"Primary industries are the powerhouse of New Zealand’s economy generating around $30 billion a year in exports, which is about 72% of all our exports.

“The Government’s focus on doubling our primary sector exports by 2025 was reinforced along with programmes like the Primary Growth Partnership which is supporting new research and development.

"Farmers are incredibly innovative and have led the rest of the nation when it comes to productivity and adapting new technology.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries ran a very successful high-profile site including well attended seminars. The beagle detector dogs were a big draw card.

“Farming communities have shown enormous resilience to come through what was probably the worst drought New Zealand has faced in 70 years. Grass growth has recovered and many regions now realise how important the Government’s support for water storage projects really is.

“Congratulations to everyone involved in running what is the biggest event of its kind in the southern hemisphere. I really enjoyed my three full-on days and it was great having Prime Minister John Key attend on Friday.

"This week has been a great chance to recognise and salute the drivers of our economy, and set some ambitious goals for the future,” says Mr Guy.
