Environment Minister Amy Adams says she is pleased with the strong demand for a new multimedia toolbox to help businesses understand and manage the risks posed by hazardous substances.

Two weeks since Ms Adams launched the resource, more than 1500 orders have been made for the toolbox.

The toolbox is designed to help businesses, particularly small businesses, understand and manage the risks posed by hazardous substances.

It includes a guide to working safely with hazardous substances, an emergency response plan, posters to use in the workplace, animated safety videos and a calculator, which allows businesses to enter a list of their hazardous substances and learn what key safety controls they must have in place.

“Between 500 and 800 New Zealanders die every year because of industrial illness, many due to exposure to hazardous substances. Many of these deaths are preventable with the right safety measures in place,” Ms Adams says.

“Chronic health problems caused by exposure to hazardous substances such as paint, solvents and liquid agrichemicals all too often lead to disabilities and early death. That is simply not good enough and attitudes in the workplace have to change.

“Businesses need to take responsibility for making sure they follow the rules for hazardous substances, which are designed to reduce the risks to workers.”

The multimedia toolbox is one of a series of measures Ms Adams has introduced in response to concerns about workplace compliance.

A comprehensive review of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms legislation is underway to determine if the regime is fit for purpose with regard to hazardous substances.

The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) will soon launch a three-year $1.35 million campaign to raise public awareness about safely managing hazardous substances both at home and at work.

“We need to end the Kiwi ‘she’ll be right’ attitude. This attitude is literally killing us.

“The EPA’s campaign will make people aware of the simple actions they can take to prevent exposure to hazardous substances.”
