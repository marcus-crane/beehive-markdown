The Crown signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Rotorua iwi Ngāti Rangiteaorere at Parliament today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

“The Crown acknowledges that it breached the Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with Ngāti Rangiteaorere, including the erosion of traditional tribal structures following the introduction of native land laws,” Mr Finlayson said. “This settlement will enable a more constructive relationship between the Crown and Ngāti Rangiteaorere in the future.”

“Ngāti Rangiteaorere receives $750,000 financial redress and the return of culturally significant sites, which is in addition to a payment of $750,000 and the prior return of Te Ngae Mission Farm in 1993.”

“The government is committed to resolving all historical treaty grievances in a just and durable way. This settlement brings us one step closer towards resolving all historical claims in the Bay of Plenty region and New Zealand as a whole,” he said.

The deed will now be implemented through omnibus legislation with Ngāti Rangiwewehi and Tapuika.
