Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, will visit New Zealand this weekend.

Mr Kishida’s visit will be the first by a Cabinet minister in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government, which came into power in late 2012.

“Japan’s participation in the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations opens a new chapter in our bilateral relationship,” Mr McCully says.

“I look forward to discussions with Mr Kishida on how we can strengthen our cooperation, both bilaterally and in the wider region.”

During his visit, Mr Kishida will also meet Trade Minister Tim Groser.
