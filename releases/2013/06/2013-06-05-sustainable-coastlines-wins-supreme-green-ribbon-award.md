Environment Minister Amy Adams has tonight announced that the Sustainable Coastlines Charitable Trust is the Supreme Winner of the 2013 Green Ribbon Awards.

The award was presented to the Trust at a ceremony hosted by Ms Adams at Parliament tonight. A further eleven category winners from around the country were also announced.

Sustainable Coastlines manages a wide network of volunteers to protect and sustain coastlines in New Zealand and across the Pacific.

Among many other projects, the Trust coordinates large-scale coastal clean-up events, runs educational programmes, manages public awareness campaigns and organises riparian planting activities.

The Trust also developed an interactive, portable education station to raise awareness about waste minimisation and reduce the occurrence of marine debris.  A converted shipping container is used as a travelling educational platform and has been successfully utilised by community groups, local councils and as a feature at the national launch of SeaWeek 2012 at Auckland Zoo.

“The Trust has adopted an innovative and broad-reaching approach to environmental education and outreach. Its methods are highly engaging and effective,” Ms Adams says.

“Marine debris has great repercussions on public health and the marine environment. The Trust has been pushing boundaries, using innovative ways to engage with the community and has demonstrated great entrepreneurship in tackling this issue.”

The Green Ribbon Awards recognise the outstanding contributions made by organisations, businesses and communities to protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment.
