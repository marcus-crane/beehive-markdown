ACC Minister Judith Collins has announced Mr Mark Gilbert as Chair of the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC).

The MSAC advises ACC, on behalf of motorcyclists, how to invest funds collected through the Motorcycle Safety Levy, paid as part of the motorcycle relicensing process.

“I congratulate Mr Gilbert on his appointment. Mr Gilbert is a passionate motorcyclist, is well respected within the motorcycling industry and has an extensive understanding of manufacturing and distribution of motorcycles in New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

Mr Gilbert recently retired from the role of Managing Director of BMW New Zealand. He has worked in the automotive industry for more than 25 years and has held a number of governance roles including Vice President and President of the Motor Industry Association New Zealand, New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development and BMW Philippines.

Mr Gilbert’s two-year term on the Council will commence on 1 July 2013.

Ms Collins also acknowledges the contribution of outgoing Interim Chair Mr Paul Searancke.

“I thank Mr Searancke for the contribution he has made during his time on the Council, particularly for overseeing a number of significant motorcycle safety initiatives,” Ms Collins says.
