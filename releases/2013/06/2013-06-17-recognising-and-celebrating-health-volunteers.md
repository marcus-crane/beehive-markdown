As part of National Volunteer Week, Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced the outstanding achievement award recipients for the first annual Minister of Health Volunteer Awards.

“These awards celebrate and recognise the dedicated volunteers who are a valued part of New Zealand’s public health service,” says Mr Ryall.

“The first Minister of Health Volunteer Awards received an overwhelming number of high quality nominations with more than 90 nominations received.

“The age of the award recipients ranges from 14 to 85. Their inspiring stories highlight the commitment, dedication and hard work by volunteers to improve the quality of lives of New Zealanders.

“From running a hospital shop to creating te reo Māori resources on injury prevention to supporting young people diagnosed with arthritis – these are the people who make a difference to our health services every day.

“Well done to all the individuals and teams who were nominated for the awards and congratulations to those recognised as outstanding achievers.

“I look forward to meeting and personally recognising the award recipients, along with my associate Jo Goodhew this week,” says Mr Ryall.

Mrs Goodhew is presenting awards in Christchurch this morning, and Mr Ryall will present awards in Auckland at 10am on Tuesday 18 June and in Wellington at 2.30pm on Wednesday 19 June.

National Volunteer Week is from 16–22 June 2013 and is New Zealand’s largest celebration of volunteerism and civic participation.
