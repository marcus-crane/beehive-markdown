Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced the reappointment of Judge Carolyn Henwood as the Chair of the Confidential Listening and Assistance Service.

The Service is a time-limited body established to provide assistance to people who allege abuse or neglect or have concerns about their time in State care

prior to 1992.

Judge Henwood, a convenor of the New Zealand Parole Board, has over 20 years experience as a District Court and Youth Court Judge and has chaired the Service since its inception in 2008.

“Judge Henwood brings a wealth of senior judicial experience to a role that is often faced with complex and sensitive issues,” says Mr Tremain.

“Her leadership has been integral to the high performance of the Service to date and I have every confidence that she will maintain this record of success in her new term.”

The Service has provided assistance and support to more than 700 people to date.
