The Government is calling for applications for 2013/14 to its Regional Museums Policy fund for Capital Construction Projects, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The fund assists regional museums and art galleries that house collections of national significance to improve access to and care of these collections through major construction projects. About $3 million will be available for allocation to new applications from qualifying museum and art gallery redevelopment projects.

The Regional Museums Policy for Capital Construction Projects was established in 2000/01. It recognises that nationally significant collections are held by key regional museums. Past recipients include: Toitū Otago Settlers Museum ($6 million); Rotorua Museum and Art Gallery ($7.5 million); MTG, the Hawke’s Bay Museum and Art Gallery, Napier ($6 million), the Len Lye Centre, New Plymouth ($4 million) and Tairawhiti Museum, Gisborne ($0.600 million).

Applications close at 5pm on Friday 12 July 2013.
