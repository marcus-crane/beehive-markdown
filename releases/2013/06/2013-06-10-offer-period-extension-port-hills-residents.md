Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says an extension to the offer expiry date for Port Hills properties will bring their offer process in line with that of flat land owners.

The offer expiry date will now give Port Hills property owners until 31 January 2014 to accept their Crown offer. Work is continuing on the zoning review for the 130 Port Hills properties whose owners requested another look at their zoning, and an announcement on final zoning decisions is expected in the coming weeks.

“We know there has been a long wait for the Port Hills owners who requested we review their zoning, but it cannot be forgotten that this zoning decision is based on life risk,” Mr Brownlee says.

He says the review is taking in all Port Hills zoned areas, and not just those who specifically asked for the review, which adds a layer of complexity to the process.

“It is not as simple as looking at the liquefaction risk for buildings on flat land; safety and life risk is another ballgame altogether and we must make the most informed decisions possible.”

Mr Brownlee says once the outcome of the zoning review has been finalised, CERA will attempt to contact all property owners affected by zoning changes individually.

The Port Hills offer process is different to the flat land as property owners must complete final settlement within six weeks of accepting the Crown offer. Flat land owners had various deadlines up until May 31 2013 to accept their offer, but were able to nominate any date up until 31 January 2014 to complete their final settlement and move out of the property.
