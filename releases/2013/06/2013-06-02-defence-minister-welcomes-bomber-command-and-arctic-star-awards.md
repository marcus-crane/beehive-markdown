Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman welcomes two new UK awards for service in Bomber Command and the Arctic Circle during World War II.

13 Bomber Command Clasps and an Arctic Star are being presented today to a group of Kiwi veterans at the Auckland War Memorial Museum Hall of Memories at an event organised by the Bomber Command Association.

“It is great to see these veterans being awarded the recognition for their service during WWII. It is fitting that they were able to receive their awards today, marking the annual Commonwealth Bomber Command Day celebration,” says Dr Coleman.

“These awards recognise the great bravery of those who contributed to two highly significant campaigns. Personnel who served north of the Arctic Circle and the aircrew in Bomber Command faced many dangers. A significant number of New Zealanders died whilst serving their country during WWII. We pay tribute to the sacrifices of so many and remember those who never returned home.”

In February this year the UK Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans announced the institution of the Bomber Command Clasp and the Arctic Star. The awards are the first new Commonwealth WWII awards since the late 1940s when the original medallic recognition system was finalised.

Up to 6,000 NZ Armed Forces personnel served as aircrew in Bomber Command and up to 1,000 former Royal New Zealand Navy or former New Zealand Merchant Navy personnel served north of the Arctic Circle during WWII.

The UK Ministry of Defence is supplying the awards free of charge and the NZ Defence Force will administer them. The NZ Defence Force estimates that around 2,000 applications may be received for the Bomber Command Clasp and around 300 applications for the Arctic Star. The awards can be issued to veterans or to the next of kin of those who are deceased.
