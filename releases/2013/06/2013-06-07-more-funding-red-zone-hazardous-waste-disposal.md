Environment Minister and Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Amy Adams has today announced a further $500,000 of funding to safely dispose of hazardous household waste from residential red zone houses.

Today’s announcement takes total government funding for the programme to more than $1 million.

Ms Adams says the first stage of the project collected more hazardous waste than originally expected, so the Government has stepped up and increased funding for the initiative.

“With 7860 properties identified in the red zone in Christchurch, it is important that any hazardous household materials, such as cleaning products, paint, LPG, and garden sprays, are removed and disposed of in a safe and environmentally-sound way,” Ms Adams says.

“Not only does this project manage the safe disposal of hazardous waste, it also provides valuable information about the types of waste found in the typical New Zealand home.

“It is also a timely reminder to all New Zealanders that if they have any hazardous waste around the house, they should dispose of it safely.”

Through the clean-up programme, a mobile service will collect hazardous waste from the red zone properties prior to demolition.

The scheme, which is being run in partnership with Environment Canterbury, Christchurch City Council and Waimakariri District Council, is due to be completed by the end of the year. More than 360 tonnes of waste is expected to be collected.

The Government is funding about 76 per cent of the project from the Waste Minimisation Fund, with the rest of the money coming from the councils.

Money for the Waste Minimisation Fund comes from a levy charged on waste disposed of at landfills.

To date, the Government has allocated $43.3 million in funding for 83 projects through the fund.
