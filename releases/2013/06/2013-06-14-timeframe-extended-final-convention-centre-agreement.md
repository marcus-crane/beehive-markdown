The Government and SkyCity Entertainment Group have extended the timeframe for negotiation of the final agreement to design, build and operate the $402 million New Zealand International Convention Centre.

The Heads of Agreement signed by both parties on May 12 sought the completion of a full agreement by June 14, or at a later date by mutual agreement. It set out the contribution that each side would make to building the NZICC and was negotiated by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on behalf of the Government, with approval by Cabinet.

The parties have today agreed to extend the period for negotiating the final agreement to June 30.

“The Heads of Agreement remains unchanged in all other respects,” Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says. “As I said at the time, concluding a final agreement in a month was always going to be ambitious.

“Legislation that will give effect to the agreement will be introduced to Parliament once the agreement has been completed and will proceed through Select Committee and other normal parliamentary processes.”

An international convention centre in Auckland will generate significant spin-off benefits including a projected $90 million annual injection into the economy; an estimated 1000 jobs during construction; and 800 jobs once it is up and running. It will accommodate up to 3500 delegates.
