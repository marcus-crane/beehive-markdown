Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today announced the appointment of the Rotorua Children's Director to lead implementation of the local Children’s Team.

Toni Hocquard, the Rotorua Regional manager of Stand Children's Services, has been seconded to take up the role after Kirsten Rei reached the end of her appointment.

“I’m delighted Toni has taken on this leadership role, she has the skills and experience necessary to keep the momentum going around this vitally important work in Rotorua,” says Mrs Bennett.

Toni Hocquard has a strong background in working with multi-agency teams, non-government organisations, and children and their families.

“Stand Children’s Services have been extremely supportive of the Children’s Action Plan and I thank them for making an important member of their team available for this work.”

"Kirsten Rei has done an outstanding job to date and built a strong foundation for the Children's Team, and I wish her the very best in her new role,” says Mrs Bennett.

The White Paper for Vulnerable Children requires Children’s Directors to provide regional leadership for co-ordinating services for vulnerable children.

Rotorua is one of the first two demonstration sites and will be live from 1 July.
