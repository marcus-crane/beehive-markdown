Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith has accepted the resignation of Housing New Zealand’s board chair Dr Alan Jackson to avoid a potential conflict of interest.

"Dr Jackson wrote to me earlier this week to let me know he would be stepping down as chair to avoid a potential conflict of interest with his role as a director at Fletcher Building,” Dr Smith says.

“Housing New Zealand has had processes in place to avoid any perceived or real conflict of interest between Dr Jackson’s roles. However, given the scale and pace of new work by Housing New Zealand including the massive rebuild programme in Christchurch, of which Fletcher Building may potentially tender for, he considered it was untenable to continue in both roles.

"Dr Jackson has done a splendid job of contributing to the evolution of social housing, particularly through chairing the ‘Home and Housed: A Vision for Social Housing in New Zealand’ report. It is a tribute to the quality of this work that it is the blueprint for the major reforms in the Social Housing Reform Bill currently before a select committee. He has also done an outstanding job in improving the performance of Housing New Zealand. I am disappointed to be losing his skills but support his decision given the potential conflict of interest.”

Dr Smith says deputy chair Adrienne Young-Cooper will be acting as chair until a new chair is appointed.
