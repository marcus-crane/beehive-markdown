Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce arrives in Europe tonight to strengthen New Zealand’s science, innovation and international education links with the European Union.

The visit includes Mr Joyce opening the biennial New Zealand-European Commission Joint Science and Technology Cooperation Committee meeting in Brussels on 20 June.

“The EU plays an increasingly major role in setting the agenda for Europe’s research and innovation,” Mr Joyce says.

“There is scope to work closer together as we attempt to find science-based solutions to the world’s problems. This is consistent with the $133.5 million the Government is allocating to the 10 National Science Challenges to tackle some of the biggest science-based issues and opportunities facing New Zealand.

“The EU also shares our focus of the need to grow business research and development to boost economic benefit.”

The Brussels meeting and workshops will also be attended by a delegation from New Zealand’s research and innovation sector.

Minister Joyce is also visiting Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom to strengthen connections in science, business, and international education.

“There is an opportunity for us to explore deeper relationships, particularly for students wanting to study in an English-speaking country,” Mr Joyce says.
