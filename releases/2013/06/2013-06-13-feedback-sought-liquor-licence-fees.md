The Government is seeking public feedback on proposals for a new risk-based system for setting fees to more fairly and fully cover the costs of alcohol licensing.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the Ministry of Justice has released a public discussion document today proposing a risk-based fees system where the liquor outlets that pose higher risks and generate higher costs pay a higher fee.

“We want a system that recovers the full cost of alcohol licensing, and more fairly apportions the costs of the liquor licensing system,” Ms Collins says.

“Currently all licensees pay the same fees, regardless of their size and despite the fact that some types of premises clearly create more costs than others.

“Current fees recover only around 56 per cent of the costs of the licensing system and ratepayers are subsidising the alcohol industry by about $5.4 million per year.”

Under the discussion document proposals, low cost/low risk outlets, such as winery cellar door sales will pay lower fees. Higher risk, higher cost outlets, such as bottle stores and nightclubs will pay more.

“The proposals in the document provide a framework for the industry, communities and other interested parties to have their say and offer their solutions for improving the funding of liquor licensing,” Ms Collins says.

Consultation on the new fees framework will run between 13 June and 12 July 2013.

The discussion document is available from the Ministry of Justice [website](http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/a/alcohol-licensing-system-new-fee-regime-public-consultation-paper/).
