Health Minister Tony Ryall welcomed today’s announcement that New Zealand and Canadian researchers will work together to explore ways to better care for older people with complex health needs in the community.

The Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC) and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) will jointly fund the research project, with the HRC investing $1.2 million and the CIHR investing $2.5 million.

“Like many other countries around the world the demand on health services in New Zealand and Canada continues to grow,” says Mr Ryall.

“More people are living beyond the age of 85 but have multiple long-term health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, dementia or cancer, and need additional health and disability support services.

“Keeping these people healthy in the community is a priority in New Zealand.

“This National-led Government is investing more in home-based services to help older New Zealanders live in their homes longer. We are investing more in the prevention of diseases including cancer screening. And we are investing more in programmes supporting patients with long-term conditions.

“Both New Zealand and Canada recognise the importance of providing personalised healthcare closer to home. This joint research project will explore innovative community-based health care service models that address the health and social needs of older adults with complex care needs.

The research will be carried out over five years and will be led by Professor Toni Ashton at the University of Auckland and Dr Walter Wodchis at the University of Toronto.
