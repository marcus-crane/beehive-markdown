Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata says Pacific people will play a key role in New Zealand’s future economic prosperity and it is vital they are given the best support to succeed in business.

“As one of the fastest-growing populations in New Zealand, Pacific people have the opportunity to help shape and influence New Zealand’s economic future,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Parata addressed business entrepreneurs at Unlimited Pasifika, a Pacific Business Trust event in Wellington. Th event celebrates Pacific achievement and success and showcases local Pacific businesses.

“The Pacific Business Trust is helping Pacific businesses and entrepreneurs get off the ground and guiding them towards their goals. This support is essential to their success.” says Ms Parata.

The Pacific Business Trust, funded through the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, offers training, support and business development services to help Pacific entrepreneurs and business people succeed.

“The support of the Pacific Business Trust means that new and established Pacific businesses are able to call upon the knowledge of business experts to assist them in their own business journey.

“As more Pacific businesses and entrepreneurs flourish, then other Pacific people will be encouraged to follow their dreams of business ownership,” says Ms Parata.
