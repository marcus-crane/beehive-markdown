Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced Auckland lawyer Sarah Roberts as the next Chair of Public Trust.

Ms Roberts replaces current Chair Trevor Janes who retires from the Board at the end of this month.

“Ms Roberts has been a member of the Public Trust Board since 2007 and her experience will ensure continuity and a smooth transition in the leadership of Public Trust,” Ms Collins said.

Another board member, Sue McCormack, will be reappointed for a second term.

Ms Collins thanked both Mr Janes and also retiring Deputy Chair Robin Hill for their leadership of the Board and strong contribution to the transformation of Public Trust.

“I’m confident that with Ms Roberts as Chair, assisted by the existing and new members, the Board will be well placed to lead Public Trust in the next phase of its development.”

Ms Roberts commences her term as Chair on 1 July 2013.
