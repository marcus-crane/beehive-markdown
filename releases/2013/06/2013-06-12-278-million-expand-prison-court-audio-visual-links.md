Corrections Minister Anne Tolley and Courts Minister Chester Borrows have announced that safety and security is being enhanced with the expansion of audio-visual links (AVL) to a further 14 District Courts and nine prisons, allowing more prisoners to make court appearances while physically remaining inside the wire.

The $27.8 million expansion will take place over the next two years, with connected courts able to link with connected prisons anywhere in the country. 

Approximately 40,000 remand court appearances are made each year and, where installed, AVL is expected to be used in a significant number of these.

“There are enormous benefits to be gained by using AVL to allow prisoners to appear before a judge without leaving the secure confine of prison grounds, and it has already saved over 8000 external prisoner trips to and from courts,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The risks associated with transporting prisoners outside the wire - to the public, Corrections and court staff – are completely removed, along with any risk of escape.

“AVL is also more efficient, as it means Corrections and Police don’t have to spend valuable time planning, carrying out, or funding escort duties from prison to court and back again. It also removes the risk of contraband being smuggled back into prisons.”

“Our drive to modernise the court system is about using technology to deliver court services in ways which are better, faster, cheaper, easier, and more convenient.  AVL absolutely fits that bill,” says Mr Borrows.

“The AVL programme is a joint initiative of the Department of Corrections and the Ministry of Justice and is enabled by the Courts (Remote Participation) Act.  It was first installed in the Auckland District Court in August 2010, and was followed by installations in Hamilton, Manukau, the Mason Clinic in Auckland, and more recently in Christchurch.

“It is already in place in Mt Eden, Waikeria, Christchurch Men’s and Whanganui prisons.”

AVL is funded from baseline, with an installation budget of $18 million for District Courts (with $9 million of capital from the Department of Corrections and $9 million of operational funding from the Justice Sector Fund). A further $9.8 million is budgeted for the installation in prisons, funded by the Department of Corrections.

Judges continue to have discretion to require prisoners to appear in court.
