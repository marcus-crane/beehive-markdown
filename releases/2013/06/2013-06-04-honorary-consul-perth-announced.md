Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of an Honorary Consul to a new consulate in Perth, Western Australia.

“With the fastest growing economy of any Australian state, Western Australia has great potential for New Zealand businesses,” Mr McCully says.

“It is home to over 70,000 New Zealanders, and regular flights between Auckland and Perth have increased prospects for tourism and goods and services exports.”

Chris Ellison, a New Zealander with a business background in Western Australia, has been appointed Honorary Consul.

“Mr Ellison’s appointment is another step forward for New Zealand’s engagement with Australia - our most important bilateral relationship,” Mr McCully says.

“The Consulate, to open on July 1, will boost official and business connections and act as a focal point for the many New Zealanders who live there.”
