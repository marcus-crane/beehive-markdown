A library of short videos highlighting people’s experiences of the health and disability sector is a valuable new resource for New Zealanders, says Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

The Health Quality & Safety Commission’s consumer programme has produced more than 20 short videos over the past year featuring consumers, family/whānau and providers talking about their experiences of the health system.

“The Government is committed to improving the quality and safety of our health system.  These videos give a very personal view of what it’s like to be involved in the health system from a variety of viewpoints,” says Mrs Goodhew. 

“The videos are an extremely useful way for us to learn about how patients, family/whānau and consumers experience the care they received and therefore how quality and safety in the health system can be improved to best meet their needs.”

Most of the videos run for three to four minutes. They are grouped into four categories – patient, consumer and family/whānau videos; videos of members of the Commission’s consumer network; videos of the Commission’s consumer representatives; and provider videos.

The library includes videos of people talking about their diagnosis and living with cancer, mental illness, diabetes and other chronic illnesses.

The videos can be viewed on the [Commission’s website](http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/our-programmes/consumer-engagement/video-library/).
