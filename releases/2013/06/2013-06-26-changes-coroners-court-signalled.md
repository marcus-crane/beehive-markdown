Improvements to the coronial system, announced today following a targeted review of coroners, will make the process faster and more effective, says Courts Minister Chester Borrows.

The changes include improving coroners’ recommendations by making their scope more focused, strengthening the role of the Chief Coroner to improve timeliness and consistency in the system, and reducing effort spent on cases where a coronial investigation or inquest is unnecessary.

“I have two key goals with these changes. The first is to help improve public safety and reduce unnecessary deaths, and the second is to speed up the process to make things easier on families,” says Mr Borrows.

The Ministry of Justice sought the views of coroners and professional groups who work closely with the coronial system, such as doctors, funeral directors and pathologists, government agencies and Iwi Authorities when developing these recommendations.

“The process of review and discussions with key stakeholders has raised some really useful ideas on how to make subtle changes to the Act to improve services for families and public safety outcomes,” Mr Borrows says.

“In particular, people asked for coroners’ recommendations to really focus in on what we can learn from that case and how that death might have been prevented. They also asked for inquiries to be finished quicker.”

Coroners’ cases involving an inquest or hearing on the papers take over 400 days to complete on average, and over 700 days if coroners have to wait for another investigation to be completed.

“I have seen first-hand how the coronial process can affect families already grieving over the unexpected death of a family member,” Mr Borrows says. “Improving the process will make a real difference for these families and help them move forward with their lives.”

A key change is a requirement for coroners to involve individuals and organisations like government departments that have an interest in the death in the coronial process more so they can contribute to the evidence and help develop robust recommendations that can realistically be put into place.

“This is a pragmatic step that will make a real difference to public safety,” Mr Borrows says. “Some coroners already follow this process but including this approach in legislation will ensure this practice is consistent across all coroners.”

The proposed amendments will also strengthen the use of memoranda of understanding between coroners and other authorities that investigate deaths and accidents, for instance the Transport Accident Investigation Commission, and give the Chief Coroner a greater oversight role to help reduce duplication of investigations.

The Act will also be changed to help the Chief Coroner to be able to spread workloads more evenly among coroners and place more emphasis on his role in providing procedural guidance to speed up the coronial process and improve consistency.

The proposed changes will be made through a Bill amending the Coroners Act 2006 to be introduced to Parliament later this year. This will go through a select committee process, including public submissions before it is passed into law.

A number of other issues raised during the review, including a further clarification of which deaths need to be reported to the coroner, will be announced later this year.

Coronial services are currently provided by a Chief Coroner, 16 permanent coroners and support staff. In 2011/12, 6,095 deaths were reported to the coroner (around 20 per cent of all deaths), coroners took jurisdiction of 3,351 cases, 1,280 inquiries were opened and 288 public coronial inquests were held.
