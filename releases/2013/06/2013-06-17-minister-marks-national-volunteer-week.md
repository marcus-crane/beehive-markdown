Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today called on New Zealanders to take part in New Zealand’s largest celebration of volunteering and civic participation - National Volunteer Week, Te Wiki Tūao a Motu.

“This is a week, co-ordinated annually by Volunteering New Zealand, which is set aside to celebrate the contribution volunteers make in their communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

This year National Volunteer Week is 16-22 June and the theme is “He tāngata, He tāngata, He tāngata!” which emphasises that volunteering is all about people.

“New Zealanders are among the best volunteers in the world with nearly a third of New Zealanders volunteering collectively about 270 million hours every year,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“These people play a vital role in building stronger communities, bringing diversity, personality, history and experiences to their role. Volunteers offer connections within their community and their whānau.

“This government recognises the significant contribution of volunteers and is working to overcome barriers in policy, practice and legislation so that more people can be volunteers,” the Minister says.

“By celebrating the people involved in volunteering we are acknowledging the efforts of a vast humming web of connections, opportunities and community spirit.”

Mrs Goodhew will be recognising and celebrating volunteers throughout the week including presenting some of the inaugural Minister of Health Volunteer Awards, presenting the Volunteering Waikato Volunteer Recognition Awards, and in speeches to local Grey Power and Rotary branches.
