State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today that State Services Commissioner, Iain Rennie, has been reappointed for a three-year term.

“Iain Rennie is leading the public service through a period of significant change,” Dr Coleman says.

“His reappointment reflects the need for sustained and focused leadership as the government delivers its Better Public Services programme.

“The State Sector and Public Finance Reform Bill is the biggest change to the public service environment in a generation. The State Services Commissioner as Head of State Services will be responsible for driving that change across the bureaucracy.”

The State Services Commissioner is a statutory appointment, made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Iain Rennie has served as State Services Commissioner since 1 July 2008. He was Deputy State Services Commissioner from February 2007. Mr Rennie came to the State Services Commission from the Treasury where he gained experience in a range of macroeconomic advisory roles prior to being appointed as a manager in 1993. Between 1997 and 2007 Mr Rennie held three deputy secretary positions within Treasury.
