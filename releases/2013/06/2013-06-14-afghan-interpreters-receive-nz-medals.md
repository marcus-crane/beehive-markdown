Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s presentation of New Zealand operational medals to the 30 Afghan interpreters who have resettled in New Zealand.

“I am very pleased that our Afghan interpreters who served with our troops and police in the NZ Provincial Reconstruction Team (NZPRT) in Bamyan are being awarded these medals today,” says Dr Coleman.

“As New Zealand residents, it is appropriate that they receive the same medallic recognition as the New Zealand Defence Force and New Zealand Police personnel they served alongside.

“The interpreters played a vital role in the operation of the NZPRT. They risked their lives to help New Zealanders, and we are very grateful for their service.

“Today the group is resettling in Hamilton and Palmerston North, and I’m sure they will be warmly welcomed by the local community. It is great to see that they are starting their new lives in New Zealand with their families. I wish them the very best for the future.”

Chief of Army, Major General Dave Gawn, is presenting the group with the New Zealand General Service Medal (Afghanistan) Primary Operational Area (NZGSM) and the New Zealand Operational Service Medal (NZOSM).
