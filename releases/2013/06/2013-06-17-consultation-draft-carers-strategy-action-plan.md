Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has announced the opening of consultation on the second Carers’ Strategy Action Plan.

“The New Zealand Carers’ Strategy was launched in 2008 with an Action Plan covering 2008 to 2012. The Action Plan is now in the process of being renewed for the five years covering 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2018,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The Strategy acknowledges that improving support for informal carers is important for developing strong healthy families and meeting future challenges of providing care.

“A draft Action Plan for 2013 to 2018 has been prepared with input from the Carers Alliance, taking into account international trends and government priorities.

“In order to make the new Action Plan as relevant as possible, it is really important that carers provide their feedback on this draft.

“The consultation is being run by the Ministry of Social Development and finishes on Friday 2 August 2013. 

“I encourage everyone who is interested in this important work to take this chance to have their say.”

Information on the consultation process and a copy of the draft Action Plan are available on the Ministry’s website [www.msd.govt.nz](http://www.msd.govt.nz).
