A Bill that will help deliver a system that supports better planning decisions and creates a streamlined process for the first Auckland Unitary Plan has passed its second reading in Parliament tonight.

Environment Minister Amy Adams says the Resource Management Reform Bill 2012 is part of a resource management reform package that will see further reforms introduced later this year.

The key features of the 2012 Bill are:

- A six-month time limit on the council processing of medium-sized consents
- A streamlined process for Auckland’s first Unitary Plan
- A stronger requirement for councils to base their planning decisions on robust cost-benefit analysis
- Consent applications for major regional projects can be directly referred to the Environment Court more easily

Ms Adams says the costs, uncertainties and delays of the current resource management system are affecting New Zealand jobs, infrastructure and productivity, and place an unfair burden on communities.

**“**There is too much uncertainty in the outcome of the process, and the impact of this is real. Potential new jobs are not being created and communities are missing out on economic benefits.

“Resource management reform is a key part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda.  We need a resource management system that provides good environmental outcomes, while still supporting economic growth, and is capable of adapting to changing values, pressures and technologies.”
