Land owners interested in building and/or renovating homes on Maori land are gathering at the Wellington Town Hall today to discuss how the Government can help at a one-day Maori housing seminar.

Associate Minister of Housing Tariana Turia says the Government has a number of new initiatives that will help Maori achieve their housing aspirations.

“This seminar will inform Maori land owners about the different types of support that the government is offering them,” says Mrs Turia.

These include:

- The new Kainga Whenua infrastructure grants, to assist with water supply and roading
- Kainga Whenua loans, which make it easier to build on Maori land
- Putea Maori housing development grants
- The Special Housing Actions Zone Fund for communities with serious housing needs

“We also want to hear what other practical solutions the Government can provide to help. The more we know about the barriers Maori face in terms of developing housing, and what has helped or will help them overcome those obstacles, the better,” says Mrs Turia.

The seminar will feature workshops and speakers, including:

- Minister of Housing, Dr Nick Smith
- Maori Land Court, Judge David Ambler
- Maori housing practitioner and lawyer, Victoria Kingi

This may become the first of a series of seminars on Maori housing.
