“Our participation in these regional processes is important. It allows us a voice in discussions that can influence the regional political, security and economic environment,” says Mr McCully.

Mr McCully will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry and other foreign ministers to discuss bilateral and regional issues.
