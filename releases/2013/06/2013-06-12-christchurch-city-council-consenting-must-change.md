Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the time has come for the Government to take urgent action to address the Christchurch City Council’s repeated inability to meet statutory timeframes for processing building consents.

This follows a letter dated 30 May from International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) to Christchurch City Council which gives the council till June 28 (16 days from today) to improve consenting processes or lose accreditation as a Building Consent Authority.

“This is to say the very least alarming and, in the circumstances of the massive rebuild we face in Christchurch, a crisis point,” Mr Brownlee says.

“For some time now we’ve had grave concerns about consenting processes at the Christchurch City Council.

“When I’ve asked for information about that in recent months I’ve been assured things were changing, and improving.

“Because of our concerns the Government has had the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (formerly the Department of Building and Housing) involved on a number of occasions since 10 February 2010 in trying to assist Christchurch City Council to improve and speed up their building consent processes.

“We have provided considerable support and advice, but still the council has failed to adequately address its systems, resources and improve the culture of its consenting staff.

“As a result Government Ministers of Canterbury Earthquake Recovery and Building and Construction are now working on a contingency plan for implementation ahead of the IANZ deadline of June 28 for a decision to be made on whether Christchurch City Council maintains its Building Consent Authority accreditation.

“I note from the agenda of the council’s Planning Committee meeting on June 5 that in March and April the council was receiving an average of 35 building applications a day, a workload which led council officers to report: ‘we have seen backlogs develop across all process steps – from pre-processing initial data entry through processing and into typing. The sheer volume exceeds capacity and applicants are expressing a significant level of concern at this.’

“The council knew this workload was coming and hasn’t adequately addressed it. We can’t let that continue and will be discussing the Government’s approach with councillors soon,” Mr Brownlee says.
