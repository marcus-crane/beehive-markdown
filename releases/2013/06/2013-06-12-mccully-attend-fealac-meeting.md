Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Bail today for the Forum for East Asia and Latin America Cooperation (FEALAC) Ministers’ meeting.

FEALAC was launched in 2001 to encourage closer links and cooperation between the two regions.

"New Zealand has significant ties with Asia and we are committed to developing closer relationships with Latin American countries through the Government’s Latin America Strategy," Mr McCully says.

"Our engagement with both regions, and our geographical location, means New Zealand is well-placed to play a constructive role in these discussions.”

While in Bali, Mr McCully will meet the Foreign Ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia and Nicaragua as well as representatives from many of the 36 FEALAC countries.
