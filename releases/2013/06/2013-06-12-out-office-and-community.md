Justice Minister Judith Collins today launched the Hutt Valley Mobile Community Office, a specially fitted-out van that will deliver justice, health and social services to the Hutt Valley.

“The Mobile Community Office ensures these important services are available to those that may otherwise not be able to access them,” Ms Collins says.

Services provided by the Mobile Office include victim support, neighbour support, immunisations, Plunket services, Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ) services, ACC services, budget advisory services and probation services.

Ms Collins says it’s fantastic to see the justice sector working with support agencies on initiatives that will make a real difference in our communities.

“The Mobile Community Office is a smart way of delivering frontline services to those who need them,” Ms Collins says

“This is what Better Public Services is about. Agencies working together to make a difference for people who need their help.”

The Mobile Office is a joint collaboration between the Ministry of Justice, New Zealand Police, Department of Corrections, Upper Hutt City Council, Hutt City Council, ACC, Regional Public Health, Hutt Valley District Health Board, Hutt Safe City, Victim Support, Upper Hutt Community Rescue, Child Youth and Family and Mowai Ahuru O te Awakairangi.

The office is a pilot and will provide services throughout the Hutt Valley, including Wainuiomata.
