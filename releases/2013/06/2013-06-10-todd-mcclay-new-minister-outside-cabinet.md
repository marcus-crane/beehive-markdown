Prime Minister John Key has today announced Rotorua MP Todd McClay will be appointed as a new Minister outside Cabinet, following the resignation of Peter Dunne.

Mr McClay was elected into Parliament in 2008 and was made the Chair of the Finance and Expenditure Committee last year.

“Mr McClay will be the new Revenue Minister and Associate Health Minister,” Mr Key says.

“The role of Associate Conservation Minister will be discontinued and those responsibilities will be assumed by the lead Minister – Dr Nick Smith.”

“I look forward to welcoming Mr McClay to the Executive. He has proven himself to be a valuable member of the National Party Caucus over the past four-and-a-half-years,” Mr Key says.

Mr McClay will be sworn in at Parliament at 9am tomorrow by the Governor-General.
