Courts Minister Chester Borrows officially reopened the Masterton courthouse today following a $3.5 million refurbishment and strengthening project.

“I want to acknowledge the support from our staff, the judiciary, local government, lawyers, Police and Corrections staff and other court users for their patience and support since we were forced to close the court,” Mr Borrows says.

“It’s been a tough road but I’m very pleased with the way the Ministry has handled the disruptions to court services over this time and I’m excited to say that the wait is over and normal service can resume.”

The courthouse has been closed since November 2011 after an engineering audit of all the Ministry’s properties nationwide found the 1912 brick courthouse was a risk to public in a serious earthquake.

The work on the courthouse was done by Greytown-based Holmes Construction Limited, which won the contract following a robust tender evaluation process.

In addition to earthquake strengthening, refurbishment work included additional public waiting areas and more accessible public counters, a single point of entry and screening station to enhance security, secure interview rooms for lawyers to meet with clients, and enhanced internet connectivity allowing Audio Visual Links to be used in court. This will allow prisoners to appear remotely in court from their prison location.

Improved internet connectivity also ensures the court is ready for the first phase of the Electronic Operating Model. This will be phased in from July 1 with electronic filing of Police charges. Later stages will see Corrections submit pre sentence reports electronically, and the final stage will enable Judges to view case information and maintain the court record electronically.
