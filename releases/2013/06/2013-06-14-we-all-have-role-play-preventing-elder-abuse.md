Elder abuse and neglect needs to stop and it is up to all of us to work together to prevent it, says Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew.

Saturday 15 June 2013 marks the eighth World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.

“World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is about acknowledging older people as integral to strong families, and affirming that there is no place for elder abuse,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The prevention of elder abuse and neglect is one of my key priorities and something I personally feel very strongly about.”

Elder abuse can take many forms, and includes behaviours or lack of action which causes physical, psychological, sexual or financial harm or distress to an older person.

“Older people are entitled to make their own decisions, feel safe and live free of fear. They have the right to dignity and care in a supportive environment,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“When a family values and supports all of its members, elder abuse and neglect will not take hold. It is only by working together that we will be able to stop abuse and neglect of our older people.

“World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is also an opportunity to recognise the good work being done by our community organisations to address this issue.

“Organisations like TOA Pacific encourage families to make time, share and celebrate each other though their “Empower to Pamper” programme.  Age Concern New Zealand provides support and information to counter elder abuse and neglect.

“This is very important work to ensure older people are treasured and valued by their family, communities and New Zealand.”

Events are being held around the country to mark World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, to celebrate older people and highlight and expose the often hidden issue of elder abuse and neglect.

Information on these events can be found on the [Ministry of Social Development](http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/whats-happening/events/2013/world-elder-abuse-awareness-day.html) website.
