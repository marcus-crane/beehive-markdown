Justice Minister Judith Collins has today announced extra support for the victims of serious crime funded by the Victims’ Offender Levy.

The $50 levy is imposed on all offenders at the point of sentencing and contributes to support services for victims of crime.

Ms Collins says it’s critical that victims get the support they need to be part of the justice process, and to help them recover and rebuild their lives.

“This Government is committed to putting victims at the heart of our justice system,” Ms Collins says.

“Over 4000 victims have received support through the Victims’ Offender Levy since it was introduced in 2009.

“I’m pleased to say returns from the offender levy will allow us to put an extra $739,000 into supporting victims of crime.”

Extra support for victims will include:

- Funding Victim Support to pilot more intensive support for homicide victims
- Introducing a Crime Scene Grant to help victims with accommodation costs where their homes or vehicles cannot be used because they are a crime scene
- Increasing discretionary funding to families of victims killed by a criminal act
- Increasing funding for the work of the national Sexual Violence Survivor Advocate

Victims of crime travelling to New Zealand from outside the Pacific to attend court hearings and support persons for parents or caregivers who are in court in place of child victims will also receive extra funding.

Ms Collins says the Government is delivering on its promise to put victims first.

“One victim of crime is still one too many – we must continue to support services that put victims first.”
