Thwarted by the fierce weather affecting the country, Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew asked Hon Todd McClay to open, on her behalf, Waikato DHB’s new $42m Older Persons and Rehabilitation Building in Hamilton today.

In welcoming the new state of the art facilities, and the difference they would make to the lives of those who needed them, Mr McClay told those present at the opening “the Government is committed to helping older New Zealanders live healthy and independent lives. As part of this commitment, we want older people to be able to live safely and independently in their homes for as long as they are able to do so.”

The new building provides a space for assessment and rehabilitation teams to provide seamless rehabilitation care, including:

- Assessment, treatment and rehabilitation services for older adults
- Mental health services for older people
- Organised stroke services, including an acute stroke service
- Rehabilitation services for people under 65 years

“By assessing and treating the medical and rehabilitative needs of older people in the Waikato region, the service will ensure that older people can return to their homes sooner and more safely” said Mr McClay.

Also attending the opening and the unveiling of a commemorative plaque were local MPs David Bennett and Tim MacIndoe who congratulated Waikato DHB on the new facility.

“This is another important piece of the ongoing redevelopment of Waikato DHB’s Hamilton campus and it should be congratulated for its work on this,” said Mr Bennett.

The facility is purpose-built with a capacity of 113 beds It also has significant outdoor areas and courtyard space, and links via bridge to Waikato Hospital. All staff will carry communication pendants to keep in contact with patients and other staff.
