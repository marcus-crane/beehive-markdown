Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has congratulated South Canterbury District Health Board (DHB) for pledging support for New Zealand’s national patient safety campaign.

The DHB today formally pledged its support for the Open for better care campaign, which was launched by Minister Goodhew on 17 May 2013.

Mrs Goodhew said she was particularly pleased to see the campaign support from South Canterbury DHB, which is in her Rangitata electorate.

“I’m delighted South Canterbury DHB has shown its commitment to working in partnership with patients, consumers and families/whānau to reduce patient harm. This is an important step in making a real difference to patient safety,” she said.

“Open for better care focuses on four key areas where evidence shows it is possible to reduce patient harm – falls, surgery, healthcare associated infections and medication. Each topic will be rolled out sequentially, with falls the first area in the spotlight.”

A wide range of people attending the pledge signing ceremony talked about what patient safety meant to them, including a public health nurse, an orderly, a physiotherapist and a representative from Sport Canterbury. The choice of speakers reflected the DHB’s belief that everyone has a part to play in keeping patients safe.

South Canterbury DHB is in the process of setting up a combined hospital and community falls prevention steering group. The steering group will ensure integration of the workplans for falls prevention in both the hospital and community. A number of the strategies for falls prevention - such as a review of medications that may increase falls risk - involve both the hospital and primary care, so it is essential that the process is well integrated.
