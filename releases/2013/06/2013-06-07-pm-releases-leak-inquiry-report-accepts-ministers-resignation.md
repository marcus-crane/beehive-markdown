Prime Minister John Key today released David Henry’s report into the unauthorised disclosure of Rebecca Kitteridge’s compliance review of the GCSB, and announced that he has accepted the resignation of Peter Dunne as a Minister.

Mr Henry’s report was delivered to the Prime Minister on the evening of Wednesday, 5 June.

“When I announced the terms of reference for the inquiry I made it very clear that I expected all Ministers and their staff to fully cooperate,” Mr Key says.

“In this situation, a sensitive government document was leaked to a reporter and that is a very serious matter.

“The report shows that Mr Dunne has not met all of the requests for information from the inquiry.

“I am extremely disappointed with what has taken place. I expect my Ministers to always uphold the highest standards, and to be held to account for their actions.

“I have met with Mr Dunne to discuss the matter. He has advised me that he remains unable to fully meet the inquiry’s requests, and accordingly, he offered, and I have accepted his resignation as a Minister.

“I am deeply saddened by these events. Mr Dunne has had a long distinguished career in Parliament and has made a significant contribution as a Minister over many years.

“He has been a great partner for the National Party in Government. But fundamentally, the public have high expectations of Ministers and so do I,” Mr Key says.

Mr Key announced that Deputy Prime Minister Bill English will be Acting Minister of Revenue until a decision is made about the permanent portfolio allocation. In the meantime, Mr Dunne’s associate Ministerial responsibilities will revert to the relevant lead Ministers.

“Mr Dunne has advised me that he intends to continue to meet the terms of United Future’s confidence and supply agreement with the National Party.

“Finally, I would like to thank David Henry for a thorough and professional inquiry,” Mr Key says.
