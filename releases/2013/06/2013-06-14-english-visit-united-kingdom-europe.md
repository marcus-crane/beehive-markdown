Finance Minister Bill English leaves for Europe and the United Kingdom next week, where he will meet government officials and business leaders, including senior staff at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.

“The visit will provide me with a direct insight into Europe’s economic challenges and their expected impact on New Zealand over the next few years,” Mr English says.

“I am also keen to talk to senior officials about using technology and innovation in delivering better public services.

“And a focus of my visit will be sharing ideas about public sector reform and financial markets.”

In Paris on 20 and 21 June, Mr English will meet senior OECD officials, where the global and European economic outlook and the economic benefits of infrastructure investment will be on the agenda. He will also be looking for fresh insights into policy issues affecting New Zealand.

Mr English visits The Netherlands on 24 June, meeting with the Dutch Central Bank and the Dutch Tax Agency.

Later that week, he will travel to London, meeting business and investment market leaders, along with senior UK government officials in the areas of information technology and shared public services, as well as the London School of Economics.

Mr English leaves New Zealand on Tuesday 18 June and returns on Sunday 30 June.
