Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman welcomes the release of the Defence Force’s Court of Inquiry into two incidents in August 2012 where five soldiers lost their lives in Bamyan Province, Afghanistan.

“Losing five of our soldiers in Afghanistan in August last year was a very tragic and difficult time for the Defence Force and for New Zealand,” says Dr Coleman.

“Today’s release of the inquiry will be difficult for the families who continue to mourn their loved ones.

“I wish to pay tribute to all 10 New Zealand soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, and to those who have been wounded in the line of duty.”

The Baghak contact on 4 August 2012 was one of the most complex fire-fights involving Defence Force personnel since the Vietnam War.

“Our soldiers performed well under fire, and displayed great courage and professionalism. It was a very intense situation and our eight casualties occurred within a chaotic 12-minute period,” Dr Coleman says.

“Two of our soldiers were injured as a result of friendly-fire. The reality is that while unfortunate, this is always a risk during complex combat situations.”

Four National Directorate of Security (NDS) personnel lost their lives that day and nine NDS, an Afghan National Policeman, and an Afghan national were wounded as a result of insurgent fire.

“Afghan lives were saved that day due to the actions of New Zealand troops. The inquiry found no evidence that our people killed or wounded any Afghan National Security Forces personnel,” says Dr Coleman.

The Court of Inquiry also examined the repatriation of the three soldiers who were killed by an Improvised Explosive Device on 19 August 2012.

“This was an unusual situation and the three soldiers were processed as best they could be given the situation and the resources available,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Defence Force has conducted a review of Mortuary Affairs, working with NZ pathologists, NZ Police and the Coroner, and they are updating their operating procedures.”
