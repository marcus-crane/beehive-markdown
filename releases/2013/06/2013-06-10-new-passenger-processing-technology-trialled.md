Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the Customs Service has begun trialling the next generation of automated passenger processing technology, SmartGate Plus, at Auckland International Airport.

The prototype gate, which has been supplied by Morpho Australasia, is a one-step process which eliminates the kiosk and ticket – a requirement of its predecessor.

It uses face-on-the-fly technology that photographs the person as they approach the scanner.

“This technology builds a 3D image as you walk up to the gate and then flattens the image to match it against your ePassport photo. The whole process take about nine seconds, which is more than two times faster than the SmartGates currently installed at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

“This is the first single-step prototype using 3D for face recognition to be used in a live operational environment. About 4000 SmartGate Plus eligible passengers each week are expected to use the gate, which has been installed at Air New Zealand’s premier departure,” Maurice Williamson says.

It will be available for passengers over the age of 16, who have a New Zealand, Australian, US or UK ePassport. The new gate will be trialled for about three months and then evaluated.

Each week, approximately 50,000 people use Customs’ existing SmartGates when arriving or departing New Zealand.

“Biometric self-processing technology has streamlined passenger processing and provided a secure, efficient way to clear passport control.”
