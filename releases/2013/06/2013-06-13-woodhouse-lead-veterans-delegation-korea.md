The 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice next month will be attended by a New Zealand delegation including thirty Korean War veterans between the ages of 73 and 88.

Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse will lead the official delegation to the Republic of Korea, where Anzac, United Nations and New Zealand commemorative services will be held between 26 – 28 July.

“New Zealand played an important part in the Korean War, and suffered significant losses. We committed more than 6000 personnel, and lost 45 men, with another 79 wounded,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“It will be an honour to accompany the veterans back to Korea for these commemorations, and it’s pleasing to provide them with the opportunity to share stories and reflect on their time at war.

“Our veterans deserve recognition and support for their service. In 2011 the Government committed to funding a number of veterans to attend major 60th and 70th commemorations linked with their service.”

Mr Woodhouse says the government is funding a number of commemorations where it meets the costs of international travel, accommodation, on-ground support and medical costs for eligible veterans to attend.

“A delegation of veterans travelled to New Caledonia for Anzac Day to commemorate the War in the Pacific, which was a very special trip. There will also be major commemorations around Monte Cassino in May 2014, followed by D-Day in June 2014.”

The official delegation departs New Zealand on Tuesday 23 July.
