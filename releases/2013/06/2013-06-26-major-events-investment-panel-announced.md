Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced an eight-member investment advisory panel for the Major Events Development Fund.

The Major Events Investment Panel, chaired by Brian Roche, will advise Major Events Ministers - whose portfolios include Tourism, Foreign Affairs, Sport and Recreation, Economic Development, and Arts, Culture and Heritage – on investing the $10 million per annum Fund.

“Brian was extensively involved in New Zealand’s successful delivery of the Rugby World Cup 2011 and is committed to ensuring that Government investment in future major events achieves economy-wide benefits,” Mr Joyce says.

Also appointed to the Panel is Therese Walsh, who is currently Head of New Zealand for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.

“Therese’s experience in senior roles with Rugby New Zealand 2011 has provided her with practical knowledge of hosting pinnacle events in New Zealand.”

Other members of the Panel include the chief executives of six government agencies that have an interest in ensuring major events in New Zealand can be leveraged to meet wider government objectives. These are:

Chief Executive, Ministry for Culture and Heritage – Lewis Holden

Chief Executive, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment – David Smol

Chief Executive, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade – John Allen

Chief Executive, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise – Peter Chrisp

Chief Executive, Sport New Zealand - Peter Miskimmin

Chief Executive, Tourism New Zealand – Kevin Bowler

“This new Investment Panel will enable greater value to be drawn from the significant investment that the Government makes in major events each year,” Mr Joyce says.

“Such events generate a wide range of direct and indirect benefits for New Zealand including tourism revenue, new business opportunities, development of infrastructure and amenities, achievement in sports and arts, and national pride.”
