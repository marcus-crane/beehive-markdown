Education Minister Hekia Parata will attend the 13th education seminar organised by Libertad y Desarrollo in Santiago, Chile this week.

The seminar will be attended by over 1,000 teachers from public schools, principals, country school managers and other key sector stakeholders.

Ms Parata, who leaves for Chile tomorrow, will make three presentations on; ‘*The Keys to Public Education Success in New Zealand’, ‘Professional Development of Educators in New Zealand: The key to a Globally High Performing Education System,’ and ‘Intercultural Education.’*

“New Zealand is recognised in Chile as having one of the most successful education systems in the world,’’ says Ms Parata.

“We are the only country to be selected by the Chilean Government for the ‘*Penguins Without Borders’* programme to date, which sees high-achieving Chilean students travel to New Zealand to study.  This speaks volumes for the high regard in which our education system is held in Chile.

“I am looking forward to discussing ways to expand initiatives such as this, and demonstrating New Zealand’s commitment in education cooperation between the two countries.’’

While in Chile, Ms Parata will also meet the Ministers of Economy, of Education, of Agriculture, and of Labour. 

“This will provide me with a great opportunity to raise further awareness of New Zealand’s education brand, promote our education system, meet and establish connections with key education figures in Chile, and pave the way for future education cooperation between the two countries.”

Ms Parata will also use the opportunity to personally invite Chile’s Minister of Education to attend the International Summit on the Teaching Profession which New Zealand will host in March 2014.
