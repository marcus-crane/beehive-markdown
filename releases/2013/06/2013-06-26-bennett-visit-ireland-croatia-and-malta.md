Social Development Minister Paula Bennett leaves tonight for Ireland and Europe to meet Ministerial counterparts, visit community organisations and advance Social Security Agreements.

In Europe we have an opportunity to advance and conclude bilateral Social Security Agreements with Croatia and Malta.

In Croatia, Minister Bennett intends to advance discussions on the signing of a Social Security Agreement which would allow pension portability for nationals of both Croatia and New Zealand.

Ministerial counterparts in Croatia have also expressed an interest in meeting to discuss child protection and social development issues.

“I will also be joining the Croatian Club NZ cultural group and Te Ihi Connection kapa haka group when they perform in Croatia during an important time as the country signs up to the European Union.”

“This is an opportunity to strengthen our ties with Croatia. Around 100,000 Croatian descendants live in New Zealand and they form a strong part of the local communities they live in. ”

Minister Bennett will sign a Social Security Agreement with officials in Malta and attend several bilateral meetings with Ministers.

The trip to Ireland includes visits with youth services and advocates, researchers, child protection organisations and employment services.

“I’m particularly keen to meet with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Ombudsman for Children and child protection agencies about their work with children in care and addressing abuse and neglect.”

“As well as furthering work on Social Security Agreements, this trip is an opportunity to deepen our understanding of policy settings in other countries and how they are facing the challenges of the global financial crisis.”

“I’m also focused on learning from non-government organisations in all three countries about how they contract with government while maintaining their independence,” says Mrs Bennett.
