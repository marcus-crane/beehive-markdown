Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today welcomed the appointment of Sue Mackwell as the new National Children’s Director.

“Ms Mackwell has been a key figure in social policy development for many years, and a highly respected leader at the Ministry of Social Development,” Mrs Bennett said.

“In her role as Deputy Chief Executive for Social Policy and Knowledge she has been instrumental in driving the extensive policy work behind the White Paper for Vulnerable Children.”

As National Children’s Director Ms Mackwell will be responsible for managing the implementation of the Children’s Action Plan, and leading the establishment and rollout of the new Children’s Teams.

“This appointment represents a significant investment towards achieving the aims of the White Paper, and is a key milestone for the Children’s Action Plan,” Mrs Bennett said.

The National Children’s Director will report progress on the Children’s Action Plan to the Vulnerable Children’s Board, which is made up of key government Chief Executives.

The Children’s Action Plan contains more than 50 initiatives that will better protect vulnerable children from abuse and neglect.

Children’s Teams are an integral part of this, and will see local professionals working together across the social sector to make individualised plans for vulnerable children.
