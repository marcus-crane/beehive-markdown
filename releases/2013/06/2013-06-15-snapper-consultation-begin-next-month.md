Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says no decisions have been made yet on any changes to regulations in the Snapper 1 area, but formal consultation will begin next month.

“Overall the stock is growing and in good health. This is a highly valuable fishery and we need to ensure the benefits are shared sustainably amongst all sectors.

“The new plenary science report shows the stock is rebuilding well, and anecdotal evidence suggests it is in good health.

“However challenges still remain. Overall snapper numbers are up 70% over the last 15 to 25 years, but are still only about half the level of the current management target.

“There will be a full consultation process beginning in July, covering a wide range of options – including increases or decreases to both commercial and recreational limits.

“These options are yet to be finalised, but will include keeping the status quo.

“An option of reducing recreational bag limits may be one of the options floated, but this could be combined with an increase to the overall recreational tonnage. This would allow more people to enjoy this valuable natural resource.

“I encourage everyone to have their say when consultation begins in July, and caution people against jumping to conclusions.

“Any decisions will be based on the best available science, and be widely consulted on. We need to ensure this valuable fishery is sustainable for future generations.

“I look forward to final advice being provided to me in September so that any new rules are in place for the new fishing season beginning in October,” says Mr Guy.
