Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed $6.88 million in Government funding for two new Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) programmes, which will deliver a major boost to productivity and environmental outcomes.

“A project led by the Whai Hua group will work to develop new probiotic dairy health products. This will help to add value to what we export by targeting high value niche markets.

“This will involve Miraka Ltd, the first Māori owned dairy processing company and agribusiness Wairarapa Moana Incorporation which runs dairy and forestry operations.

“The Government and the companies involved will invest $1.75 million each into this project. It expects to generate $8.6 million a year in economic benefits to New Zealand by 2021.

“The second project will help improve how fertiliser is applied to hill country. Remote sensors will measure soil fertility and then connect with GPS–guided aerial topdressing to deliver targeted applications.

“This will help the environment by better targeting fertiliser use and reducing nutrient run-off. At the same time it will help sheep and beef production and profitability by growing more pasture,” says Mr Guy.

The programme is being led by Ravensdown and research partners are Massey University’s Precision Agriculture Group and AgResearch.

The Government and Ravensdown will each invest $5.13 million, and it expects to generate $120 million a year in economic benefits to New Zealand by 2030.

The Government and industry have so far committed $674 million of multi-year funding for 15 projects.  The potential benefit to the wider economy from these projects is over $7 billion per year from 2025.
