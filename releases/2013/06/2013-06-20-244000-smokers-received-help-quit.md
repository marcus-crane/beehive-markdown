The latest primary care health target results show general practices are focused on improving the health of New Zealanders, with almost a quarter of a million smokers receiving brief advice to quit from their GP or practice nurse in the past year.

“There is strong evidence that a brief conversation with a health professional is one of the most effective ways to get people to give up smoking,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Performance in the better help for smokers to quit target has increased by 11 per cent since July 2012, when the primary care target was first published.

“While more work is needed to help more smokers to quit, significant improvements have been made.

“For example, nine primary health organisations (PHOs) have achieved increases this quarter of more than 20 per cent – Health Hawke’s Bay Limited, Western Bay of Plenty PHO, South Canterbury Primary and Community Services, Eastern Bay Primary Health Alliance, Nga Mataapuna Oranga Limited, Christchurch PHO Limited, Southern PHO, Kimi Hauora Wairau (Marlborough PHO Trust) and Rural Canterbury PHO.

“Improvements have also been made with the increased immunisation with 33 out of 35 PHOs achieving the increased immunisation target for eight month olds. And there has been a three per cent increase with the more heart and diabetes checks this quarter.

“This year’s Budget includes $35m to support more heart and diabetes checks and to provide more care and support for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes.

“I congratulate general practices and PHOs for their focus on improving the health of New Zealanders and encourage them to continue their hard work to achieve these important preventative health targets,” says Mr Ryall.

PHOs are funded by district health boards to provide health care services through general practices to patients who are enrolled with them.
