Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the Canterbury Home Repair Programme is approaching the half way mark, with more than 38,000 of around 80,000 full residential repairs completed.

“With about 1800 repairs a month currently being completed, the Canterbury Home Repair Programme will hit the half-way mark within the next few weeks,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Very often the first half of the journey is the hardest, and there’s some truth in this in Canterbury due to the large amount of preliminary work required for many of the more complex repairs.

“Not least of this is the extensive Technical Category 3 geotechnical drilling and investigation that was necessary to identify the appropriate repairs for homes with structural and foundation damage.”

More than 1441 holes were drilled in TC3; making it New Zealand’s largest ever residential land drilling programme.

Repairs have been carried out right across Christchurch, with 43 per cent completed in the eastern suburbs, where more than 80 per cent of the more complex repairs exist. EQC has set a target of completing repairs to properties with the worst structural damage by the end of this year, and all repairs completed by the end of 2015.

“Even before the substantive repair programme was underway in earnest, around 47,000 emergency repairs were being completed and 19,000 heat pumps or solid fuel heaters were being installed to mitigate some of the worst impacts of the earthquakes,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Canterbury Home Repair Programme is managed for EQC by Fletcher EQR, a subsidiary of Fletcher Construction, and is the largest residential repair project of its kind. It manages the repair of properties where the damage falls between $15,000 to $100,000 plus GST per claim.

Research shows that more than 80 per cent of owners whose properties have been repaired under the programme are satisfied or very satisfied with their repair.

“Our goals in establishing the Canterbury Home Repair Programme were to ensure quality repairs which supported property values over time; and stemming price inflation for work done and the materials used,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I know many people are anxious for work to start. We have almost 1300 contracting firms accredited to the programme with around 5000 people working for them.

“More than $1.25 billion in payments have been made to contractors – about $3 million a day.”

To date EQC has paid more than $5.5 billion (including GST) on building, land and contents claims.
