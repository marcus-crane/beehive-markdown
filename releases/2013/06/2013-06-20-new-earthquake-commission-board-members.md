Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee today announced three new appointments and two reappointments to the board of the Earthquake Commission (EQC).

Sir Maarten Wevers has been appointed as a board member, and will take up the role of chairman on 1 August 2013, when the current chairman, Michael Wintringham, retires.

EQC’s level of insurance expertise is also being bolstered with the appointment of former Vero chief executive Roger Bell of Auckland, and Dr Alison O’Connell, an actuary as well a former insurance company executive and a public policy specialist.

Mr Brownlee thanked Mr Wintringham and his fellow retiring board member Denise Bovaird for their respective contributions. In particular, he recognised the substantial achievement and commitment of Mr Wintringham, who has been on EQC’s board since 2004 and its chairman since 2006.

“Michael has given a huge personal commitment and support to the EQC, especially in the period following the Canterbury earthquakes, when the organisation has been required to grow and transform in response to the disaster,” Mr Brownlee says.
