Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams leaves today for a Ministerial ICT conference in Singapore.

More than 500 delegates from the Asia Pacific region will be represented at the conference, which will focus on key ICT trends, policies and regulations.

“Conferences like this provide an important opportunity to discuss the economic, social and cultural opportunities that ICT provides, to challenge existing thinking about how we utilise the connected world and to question what we need to do better,” Ms Adams says.

“It is also a good chance to learn more about the development of broadband infrastructure, telecommunications and the digital economy in the Asia Pacific region.”

Specific topics that will be discussed during the conference include the transformation of public service delivery, emerging trends and challenges brought about by ICT beyond 2013, public and private sector collaborations and fostering innovation through open government, social media and cloud computing.

Ms Adams has been asked to set out the New Zealand Government’s various ICT initiatives, including the Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband programmes, and the action taken to address the high cost of mobile roaming rates between New Zealand and Australia.

The conference will also provide an opportunity for Ms Adams to meet with a number of her Ministerial counterparts, including Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Singapore Minister for Communications and Information.

“I am particularly keen to talk to Dr Ibrahim about Singapore’s approach to rolling out fibre and the setting up of 4G mobile technology.“
