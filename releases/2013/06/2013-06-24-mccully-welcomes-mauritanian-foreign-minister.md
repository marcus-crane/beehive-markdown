Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the Mauritanian Foreign Minister, Mr Hamadi Ould Baba Ould Hamadi, to New Zealand.

“The visit by Mr Hamadi is the first by a Minister from the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, and represents an opportunity to develop closer ties between our two countries,” says Mr McCully.

“As a country that straddles North and West Africa, Mauritania has a unique perspective on the region that can enhance New Zealand’s understanding of Africa and the role we can play there.

“Mr Hamadi’s visit is focused on how our expertise in sustainable fisheries management and livestock development can be applied in Mauritania.

“We want to partner with African states in a way that brings mutual benefit and increase our engagement across the continent by working with regional bodies, like the African Union,” says Mr McCully.
