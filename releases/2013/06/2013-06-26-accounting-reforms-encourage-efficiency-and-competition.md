Commerce Minister Craig Foss has today announced reforms to three areas of regulation regarding accounting and auditing services in New Zealand.

These reforms are to be included in an Accounting Infrastructure Reform Bill which will be introduced to Parliament later in 2013.

“This Bill will encourage efficiency, competition and give the New Zealand accounting market a more international outlook,” says Mr Foss.

The reforms will:

- enable the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) to amalgamate with the Australian Institute of Chartered Accountants in the creation of a new trans-Tasman Institute, if their members vote to do so.
- better allow competent auditors with the appropriate qualifications to offer audit services to New Zealand firms by altering restrictions on non-issuer audit work.
- allow audit firms to incorporate as a company, if they decide it’s the most efficient business form for them. The ban on audit companies incorporation is outdated and out of step with international practice. It will also allow overseas limited liability partnerships to perform some statutory audits in New Zealand.

“The reforms support the government’s Business Growth Agenda commitment to improve regulation and lift confidence in New Zealand’s capital markets,” says Mr Foss.
