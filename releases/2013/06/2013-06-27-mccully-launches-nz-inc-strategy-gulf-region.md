Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully launched the New Zealand Inc Strategy for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) during a speech to the New Zealand Middle East Business Council in Auckland this evening.

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with the Gulf region,” says Mr McCully. “Our exports to the GCC currently exceed $1.5b a year, and have grown at an average of over 10 per cent for the past three years.

“However there are further opportunities for New Zealand. The states of the GCC are diversifying their economies and looking for long-term partnerships to deliver the skills and technology they need, particularly in food security and environmental management.

“New Zealand is well placed to meet these needs. We are known internationally for our expertise in those areas, as well as in areas like renewable energy, education, and healthcare.

“To meet these needs New Zealand needs to develop strong government and private sector relationships.

“This Strategy outlines how we can work with the GCC and leverage these complementary skills,” says Mr McCully.
