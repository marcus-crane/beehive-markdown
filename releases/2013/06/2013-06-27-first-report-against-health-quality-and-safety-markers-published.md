Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today welcomed the first publication of DHB performance data against the new Health Quality and Safety Markers.

“The baseline data published by the Health Quality & Safety Commission today shows some excellent achievements but also areas where more work is needed,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“The Quality and Safety Markers aim to encourage DHBs to improve their performance at reducing patient harm caused by falls, healthcare associated infections and surgery.” 

The Markers set goals for DHBs’ use of interventions and practices known to reduce patient harm in those areas:

- 90 per cent of older patients are given a falls risk assessment
- 90 per cent compliance with procedures for inserting central line catheters
- 70 per cent compliance with good hand hygiene practice
- All three parts of the WHO surgical safety checklist used in 90 per cent of operations.

“The results published today represent a baseline from which we expect DHBs will continue to improve over time.

“They show some excellent achievements, particularly in improving central line catheter insertion practices.  This has led to a reduction in the national rate of central-line associated bacteraemia (CLAB) to almost zero.

“However they also highlight inconsistencies in DHBs’ use of these interventions and practices. No DHB performed at the highest level on all four measures, or performed badly on all four.

“The new national patient safety campaign, *Open for better care*, aims to improve performance and address inconsistencies by encouraging DHBs to share knowledge and best practices.”

The Commission will next report against the Markers in December 2013 and quarterly after that.

Quality and Safety Markers baseline data for each DHB is published on [the Commission's website](http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/our-programmes/health-quality-evaluation/projects/quality-and-safety-markers/).
