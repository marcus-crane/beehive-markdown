Legislation to ensure more fairness, flexibility and clarity in employment law passed its first reading in Parliament.

The Employment Relations Amendment Bill proposes a package of measures to improve workplace arrangements in order to lift productivity and help create jobs.  

Labour Minister Simon Bridges told Parliament the Government wants to ensure that employers have the freedom to compete and expand, while key protections for employees are maintained.

The key features of the Bill are:

- The extension of flexible working arrangements so any employee, not just caregivers, can ask for flexible work.
- A return to the original position in the Employment Relations Act where the duty of good faith does not require the parties to conclude a collective agreement. Instead, the Employment Relations Authority may declare whether collective bargaining has concluded.
- Allowing employers to opt out of multi-employer bargaining.
- Allowing for partial pay reductions in cases of partial strike action.
- Removing the 30-day rule that forces non-union members to take union terms and conditions.
- Changes to Part 6A so employers have greater certainty over the transfer of employees in certain industries such as cleaning, catering, orderly and laundry – if there is a restructuring or change in the contracted service provider. Small to medium-sized enterprises with fewer than 20 employees will also be exempt.
- Faster Employment Relations Authority processes.
- Greater clarity as to what confidential information employers are required to provide to affected workers in situations such as dismissal or redundancy.
- Requiring parties to provide notice of a strike or lock-out.

“I am especially keen to hear what affected parties have to say on the Part 6A proposals in the Bill, and will carefully consider their submissions and the recommendations of the Select Committee,” said Mr Bridges.

The Independent Taskforce on Health and Safety has recently made its recommendations to the Government, which are currently being considered.

“I want to signal my intention that, where desirable and practicable, this Bill will be the vehicle to implement any changes that need to be made to the employment relations regime as a result of the Government’s response to the Taskforce.

“Overall the proposed changes reflect a pragmatic approach to promoting flexibility and fairness in the labour market.”
