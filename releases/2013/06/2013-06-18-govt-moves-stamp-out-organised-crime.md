Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the Government will adopt a range of recommendations to better attack international and domestic organised crime networks, as part of the All of Government Response to Organised Crime.

“Eradicating organised crime is one of the major law and order priorities of this Government,” Ms Collins says.

“Although our Government consistently ranks as the most transparent and least corrupt in the World, we cannot afford to be complacent.

“These recommendations ensure New Zealand maintains our reputation as a responsible international citizen while at the same time ensuring that our domestic law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight organised crime and corruption.”

Key recommendations include:

- Redrafting the money laundering offence to say that intent to conceal is not a requirement of the offence in order to comply with international obligations from the Financial Action Task Force and the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime
- Making it easier for Police to prosecute money laundering by removing the five-year imprisonment threshold from the money laundering offence
- Requiring banks to report on all international transfers over $1,000 and all physical cash transactions over $10,000 to the Financial Intelligence Unit within Police under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (AML/CFT Act)
- Introducing new offences to address identity crime including, making it an offence to sell or pass on identity information
- Amending the trafficking offence to remove the requirement to cross borders
- Developing an anti-corruption strategy for both private and public sectors and ratifying the United Nations Convention against Corruption

“We’ve done a lot already to fight organised crime, and we’ve been successful. But it is a constantly evolving threat so we need to be a step ahead legislatively and operationally,” Ms Collins says.

“Today we send a clear message to international and domestic criminal groups that New Zealand will not tolerate their activities.”

The recommendations will be progressed through an omnibus Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Bill to be introduced in 2013.
