Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced Diane Maxwell is to be appointed as Commissioner for the Commission of Financial Literacy and Retirement Income.

“Ms Maxwell was appointed as the interim Commissioner in March on secondment from the Financial Markets Authority. I’m pleased to announce her permanent appointment today,” says Mr Foss.

Ms Maxwell has been appointed for a three year term from 1 July 2013.

“During her short time at the Retirement Commission, Ms Maxwell has demonstrated a strong focus, in particular in showing leadership in the area of financial literacy which is a key priority for the Government,” says Mr Foss.

“Ms Maxwell has the skills and experience to work with those most at risk of credit exposure and unnecessarily high levels of debt.  Ms Maxwell will build on the Commission’s work to ensure that financial literacy information is accessible to the public generally and to targeted groups. 

“Improved financial literacy helps people to make better financial decisions which will lead to better income planning and security for people in their retirement years,” says Mr Foss.

Background: Ms Maxwell was head of Stakeholder management at the FMA and has a strong background in financial literacy from her time as Head of Brand and Corporate Affairs at BNZ. Her previous roles have included partner at Michaelides and Bednash, London, Media Director at Saatchi and Saatchi, New Zealand, and as trans- Tasman consultant for the banking and telecommunications sector.
