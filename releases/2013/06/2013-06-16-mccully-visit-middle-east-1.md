Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories today for bilateral meetings and discussions on the Middle East Peace Process.

Mr McCully will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as senior members of their governments.

“I will be making clear to both parties New Zealand's strong wish to see them commence direct talks while the two-state solution remains a viable prospect,” Mr McCully says.

“With a balanced and constructive approach New Zealand can well support this process.”

Mr McCully will also visit Cyprus for meetings with President Nicos Anastasiades and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ioannis Kasoulides.
