Ex-All Black Wayne ‘Buck’ Shelford stars in television advertisements encouraging New Zealanders to get heart and diabetes checks.

“The first of two adverts starts this Sunday and features Buck Shelford along with comedian Urzila Carlson and other well-known New Zealanders,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Every 90 minutes a New Zealander dies from coronary heart disease. And every day many people are diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes.

“This National-led Government is committed to improving health services for heart disease and diabetes – with a strong focus on prevention.

“We are investing $35.5 million more over four years to better support New Zealanders with or at risk of developing diabetes, pre-diabetes and heart disease. This includes $15.9 million to further increase the number of people getting heart and diabetes checks.

“A heart and diabetes check gives you information on how to reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It will let you know what your risk is and, more importantly, the best strategies for you to improve your heart health.

“And the diabetes check alerts you if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes so you can receive care and learn about lifestyle changes that will help you.

“I encourage anyone from their mid to late 30s or up to talk to their GP or nurse about a heart and diabetes check,” says Mr Ryall.

The adverts are part of a national awareness campaign, run by the Health Promotion Agency and supported by the Heart Foundation, Diabetes NZ and the Ministry of Health.

The campaign, launched in September last year, has included radio adverts, flyers at VTNZ stations across the county and large billboards in prominent locations, including one at Wellington Airport.

A preview of the first advert is available on my Facebook page:
