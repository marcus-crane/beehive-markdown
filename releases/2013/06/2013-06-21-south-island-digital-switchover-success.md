Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss today welcomed new research showing that 99 per cent of South Island homes have gone digital.

“I would like to congratulate South Island residents on a very smooth transition to digital TV. This is a significant milestone in the project and with less than six months to go until the whole of New Zealand is digital, we are looking towards the North Island to make the move to digital TV just as successful,” says Mr Foss.

Today marks 100 days until the lower North Island, Taranaki and East Cape make the switch to digital.

“Digital TV offers more channels and a better picture. It’s important for viewers to get Freeview, SKY, IGLOO or Vodafone TV (available in the Wellington region only) if they want to keep watching TV after their region goes digital,” says Mr Foss.

Going digital will have significant benefits for New Zealand as it will free up radio spectrum for new generation mobile phone and data services.
