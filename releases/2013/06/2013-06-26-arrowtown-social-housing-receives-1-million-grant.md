Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced that the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust will receive a $1 million grant from the Social Housing Fund to build 10 community social housing units in Arrowtown.

“The grant means the trust will be able to provide 10 social housing units and provide an additional 28 bedrooms to families most in need. The total value of the development is $3.6 million,” Dr Smith said.

“I applaud the Queenstown Lakes District Council for transferring council land for this community social housing development. It is a great example of a local authority being an enabler in the development of social and affordable housing in their community. I commend the council for ignoring some vocal local nimbyism against the provision of more affordable housing in Arrowtown.

“The grant, from the Government $139 million Social Housing Fund, is part of the Government’s housing strategy to grow the community social housing sector to provide 20 per cent of social housing in the long-term. The Social Housing Reform Bill also supports this goal by extending the availability of income related rents to community social housing providers.

“Auckland and Christchurch are the major focus of the Government’s work on housing affordability, but we also recognise that there are communities like Queenstown Lakes District where it is also a problem. The district thrives on a visitor industry that needs thousands of hospitality and other tourism workers and we need to ensure there is more quality affordable accommodation for them to live.

“This initiative is a small part of the Government’s broader housing reforms. The Government will be directly building more houses in the next year than in a generation, as well as supporting initiatives like this one in Queenstown which will see record growth in the community social housing sector.”
