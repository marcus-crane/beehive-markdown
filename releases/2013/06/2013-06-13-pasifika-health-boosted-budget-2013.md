·        Strengthen governance, performance management and management systems

·        Provide for workforce improvements, IT system and research developments

·        Extend health and social service coverage and access 

·        Spread Pasifika cultural competency across the health sector

·        Improve quality of care centred around the patient

·        Improve the sustainability of services

**Questions and Answers: Regional Pacific Health Provider Approach**

**What is it?**

 

A Regional Provider Network (RPPN) is a large, formal collaboration of Pacific providers. It includes shared systems of support provided by participating providers who together serve considerable Pacific populations.

The RPPN approach will enable a regional governance body to oversee an organised network of Pacific service providers. The RRPN will achieve economies of scale by collaborating across the health, social and community sectors to access high quality management advice and workforce development support to become more sustainable.

**What is the aim?**

RPPN will be responsible for implementing an integrated service delivery model of care.

 

*For Provider networks*

- Raise organisational performance
- Enhance service development and delivery support and strengthen providers within the network to be sustainable
- Develop and embed Pacific models of care
- Joint planning, purchasing and collective bargaining
- Regional collective communication strategies

 

*For Families*

- Better access to health, social and community services
- Build family capacity and capability to meet their own health goals
- Improved health literacy levels for the whole family
- Improved management of chronic conditions
- Support lifestyle changes that are led by the family.

**Target population?**

Primarily Pacific families and other users of Pacific services, located in high populated Pacific regions.

**Who would run the programme?**

The Ministry of Health will administer the programme as part of the Pacific Provider and Workforce Development Fund (PPWDF), under the existing PPWDF work programme.

**Does this link with other government initiatives?**

This proposal is aligned with Whānau Ora and provides opportunities to work alongside Te Puni Kōkiri and Ministry of Social Development.

**Expected Outcomes**

- A more holistic approach to health for Pacific families
- Collective provider purchasing
- Sharing of information and resources
- Coordination of the sector functions improving the health and wellbeing of Pacific peoples and their families
- Cultural and linguistic competence
- Family members participate in decision making for their personal wellbeing
