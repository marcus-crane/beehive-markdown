Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says a visit by China Customs Vice Minister Mr Lu Bin this week reinforces the commitment to achieve the full benefits of the NZ-China Free Trade Agreement.

Mr Lu Bin is head of the Guangdong Sub-Administration of the General Administration of China Customs.

“Guangdong Province is a key port of entry and trade market for New Zealand, and our discussions were focussed on supporting the New Zealand-China Free Trade Agreement.

“The overall aim is to make trade and compliance easier, and work is in progress to explore solutions that will benefit traders as well as the two customs administrations,” Mr Williamson says.

China Customs will start a pilot next month using new procedures to clear New Zealand goods held in bonded storage and declared for part release into the domestic market.

“This will allow importers to receive a lower preferential tariff rate for the whole shipment, giving them the full benefits of the FTA. Initiatives such as this are aimed at contributing towards the Government’s goal of doubling our trade with China by 2015.

“Another area of focus is the Government’s methamphetamine action plan. Both administrations share information and intelligence, and have recently undertaken officer exchange programmes. There is also opportunity for future joint activity.”

Recent work by China to clarify the criminal nature of their illicit precursor trade has assisted enforcement agencies in identifying offences and undertaking investigations.
