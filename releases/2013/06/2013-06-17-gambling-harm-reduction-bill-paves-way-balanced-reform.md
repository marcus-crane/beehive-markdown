Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says collaboration with Te Ururoa Flavell on his Gambling (Gambling Harm Reduction) Amendment Bill is the first stage in a balanced series of reforms planned for the Class 4 (non-casino) gaming sector.

“The Select Committee report on the Bill was released today, and makes a number of sensible amendments which the Government supports,” says Mr Tremain.

“Mr Flavell’s Bill would have required 80 per cent of gaming proceeds to be returned to community groups in the same area the funds were raised. In principle, we support the idea that a minimum amount of funding should be distributed back to the community it came from. We will achieve this through a new regulation-making power in the Bill which enables more flexibility and further consultation over the minimum amount.

“Secondly, Mr Flavell’s Bill would have enabled the Department of Internal Affairs to mandate the use of harm minimisation devices through gaming machine operators’ licence conditions. This would be better achieved through regulation, so we support amendments to the Bill which introduce a new regulation-making power.

“The Bill also would have enabled councils to shut down or ban class 4 venues. Instead, we will enable some Class 4 operators to move their venues from low socioeconomic areas into areas such as CBDs. This will require support from the relevant local council after community consultation.

“However, the Government does not support the provisions in the Bill which would have required local councils to take over the distribution of gaming proceeds to the community; or the provisions which would have removed funding from the racing industry.

“It is my intention to introduce further legislation and regulations later this year to address other issues that have been identified in the Class 4 sector. A detailed package will be announced with Te Ururoa Flavell this week.”
