Applications for the Community Internship Programme are now being accepted, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

“This programme funds hapū, iwi or community groups with clearly identified needs to employ skilled professionals as interns for three to six months,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“It provides a chance for experienced professionals to take a break from their normal roles to help strengthen a community organisation. The aim is to increase understanding, co-operation and interaction between the private, central government, local government, community and voluntary sectors.”

The internship programme focuses on skill-sharing and the exchange of knowledge between sectors, while building ongoing relationships which continue after an internship ends.

“The programme provides wins for everyone involved – the community organisation, the intern and the home organisation,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“For example, the programme is currently funding an internship for James Luty of Beca to help Wellington Zoo Trust work towards its goal of becoming the world’s first carbon-neutral zoo.

“This internship gives Wellington Zoo Trust access to a skilled practitioner in environmental management and, at the same time, James is able to develop his project management skills. The internship also contributes to Beca’s longer-term objective of promoting environmentally sustainable solutions.”

The programme is also currently funding an intern from PHAB NZ (a disability support service) to assist The Auckland Performing Arts Centre with their strategy to become a centre of excellence for community and professional arts.

Applications close on 11 September 2013 and grants approved from this funding round will be for community internships to begin in early 2014. More information can be found by visiting www.communitymatters.govt.nz or calling the Department of Internal Affairs on 0800 824 824 during business hours.
