Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced changes to regulatory controls of some of New Zealand’s most valuable fisheries, including a decision to extend consultation on the Otago/Southland Paua fisheries review.

“I have decided there needs to be further consultation on proposals to review commercial fishing restrictions in the Otago and Southland Paua fishery.

“The importance of this fishery to recreational users has been made very clear over the past few months. 

“I have instructed the Ministry for Primary Industries to organise a process to work with all stakeholders and provide me with further recommendations on this issue in the next few months. I encourage all stakeholders to work together to reach a constructive solution.

“I have also made changes to the rock lobster fishery which will streamline reporting and recordkeeping regulations, and remove unnecessary regulation in our most valuable export inshore fishery. The changes also have the potential to open up greater opportunities for domestic sales within New Zealand of this popular seafood.”

Other decisions in today’s announcement will see:

- Commercial divers being approved to use underwater breathing apparatus (UBA), under strict conditions, for horse mussels and sea cucumber. This will promote the development of these potentially valuable export shellfish fisheries.
- Chatham Island divers will also be allowed to use UBA when harvesting paua and kina.
- Further consultation regarding the use of underwater breathing apparatus in the mainland New Zealand commercial kina fishery.
- An increase in the number of rock lobster that can be taken by recreational fishers in parts of Fiordland to improve recreational fishing opportunities.
- A decrease in the number of mussels that can be taken by recreational fishers in the Maketu Taiapure area to ensure sustainability and uphold kaitiakitanga.
- A new destination code for commercial fishers to use when completing fishing returns to improve reporting of commercial fisheries.
