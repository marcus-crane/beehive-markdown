Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has agreed to an increase in the Heavy Engineering Research levy, to support innovation in the heavy engineering sector.

The compulsory levy on heavy steel and welding consumables part-funds the Heavy Engineering Research Association (HERA), a not-for-profit industry owned and operated research association.

The levy for heavy steel, which has not increased since first introduced 25 years ago, will double to $10 per tonne from 1 July 2013. Other levy rates remain unchanged.

“I am pleased to see the willingness of this industry to invest more in innovation, as demonstrated by its support for this levy increase,” Mr Joyce says.

“HERA has demonstrated a record of achieving excellent research outcomes in areas such as steel construction, general metals fabrication productivity improvements and creating business opportunities for the metals engineering industry.”

“To get higher economic growth and greater prosperity, New Zealand as a whole will have to keep investing more in innovation – it’s as simple as that.

“This levy increase will give HERA a more stable funding base, enabling them to carry out research that will assist the New Zealand metals industry in becoming more innovative and internationally competitive.”
