The official opening of Inland Revenue’s new office in Christchurch’s Mid City building today celebrates the Government’s commitment to the future of the city says Revenue Minister Todd McClay.

“The Government has always been clear about its intention to move back into the CBD following the 2011 earthquakes. Our commitment to the city and the region has always been clear and unequivocal and the opening of Inland Revenue’s new office is an important milestone in that process.

“Like other Government agencies, Inland Revenue staff have been working in various temporary office over the past two years, and it is great to see the department back in the heart of the city.

“The opening of this new office not only provides greater certainty to Inland Revenue staff and also to the people of Christchurch.”

Mr McClay said that the building is less than ten years old and has a building safety rating of 75 per cent.

“The building was chosen for its safety and it performed well during the earthquakes. Although it suffered no structural damage, the building has since been strengthened.

“It is an ideal location for Inland Revenue and gives a boost to major initiatives such as the Re:Start Mall. With over 200 people moving in, the office will double the number of working people in the Re:Start precinct.”

Mid City is one of three sites which Inland Revenue is based in Christchurch with the other two being Russley Road and Moorhouse Avenue.

“The Government is also proposing to introduce legislation next week to extend the scope and application of the current rollover relief on depreciation of buildings to the 2018/19 income year.

“This proposal is another step in bringing investment and business back into the city and helping to rebuild a great city,” says Mr McClay.
