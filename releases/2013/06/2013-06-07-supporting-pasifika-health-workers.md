\\The Government is committed to mentoring and encouraging young Pasifika health workers, says Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia

“As Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Pacific health, I have had the pleasure of meeting with doctors, nurses, and other health professionals with Pasifika heritage.”

“Those doctors and nurses are doing an excellent job for their patients. They are skilled and they are committed. And we need more of them,” Mrs Turia says.

“That is why this government is investing $1.4 million in the Pacific Workforce Awards to sponsor Pasifika students through their study – a three-fold increase on the 2008’s government input of $481,000.”

“Translating that into people, in 2008 only eighteen Pacific Workforce Awards were awarded to doctors – and a mere seven awarded to nurses, amongst other health graduates.”

“That has increased to 64 medical scholarships and 54 nursing scholarships in 2012.”

Mrs Turia says the Ministry of Health also funds $7.4 million for a number of initiatives and programmes that contribute to the overall plan of encouraging and supporting Pasifika people to work in health.

“For example, Healthcare Heroes encourages Pasifika students in fifteen low to mid decile secondary schools across Auckland to take up science at high school.”

“Mentoring support also makes a big difference.”

“The Pacific Medical Association’s Students are our Future Programme and the Pacific Orientation Programme at Otago University (POPO) both provide mentoring support and pastoral care for Pasifika students in tertiary institutions.”

“And it’s working. There are more Pasifika medical and nursing students enrolled in study,” Mrs Turia says.

“In 2012, 128 Pasifika medical students were studying to be doctors – an increase of nearly 50 percent compared to the previous four years.”

“Studying for nursing continues to attract the largest proportion of Pacific students - 700 Pasifika students were enrolled in nursing degree courses – 280 more than in 2008.”

“Despite tight times, the Government is able to invest more in the changing needs of our population through strong financial management.”
