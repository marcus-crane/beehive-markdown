Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has turned the sod on new construction yards at Rolleston Working Prison, where prisoners will refurbish around thirty Housing New Zealand houses each year for the next five years.

The refurbishment of the earthquake-damaged houses will allow prisoners and community offenders to gain valuable training in construction skills such as carpentry, plastering, painting and decorating, roofing and joinery.

“This agreement with Housing New Zealand allows Corrections to contribute to the Christchurch rebuild, while also giving offenders valuable skills and employment training which will help reduce reoffending,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We know that prisoners in employment are less likely to reoffend, so if we give them access to training, education, and drug and alcohol rehabilitation while inside the wire, we can help steer them away from crime, and ensure they don’t create more victims upon release.

“We are also giving the Rolleston offenders skills which are much-needed in Canterbury.

“When they are released they will have a greater chance of employment, allowing offenders to make a valuable contribution to society by leading crime-free lives.

“Rolleston is one of our three working prisons, where offenders will be expected to take part in forty hours of work and rehabilitation each week.

“This agreement with HNZ will give hundreds of prisoners and community offenders the opportunity to have pride in their work and to turn their lives around.”
