Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew is today joining Canterbury DHB Chair Bruce Matheson in announcing an $8.7 million plan to redevelop Ashburton Hospital.

“The Government is committed to rebuilding Canterbury and rebuilding the health sector infrastructure is a high priority. This redevelopment will be a significant step for Ashburton, Canterbury DHB and Canterbury towards their recovery from the effects of the earthquakes,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Some Ashburton Hospital facilities were closed and some buildings assessed as high risk in the wake of the Christchurch earthquakes. The redevelopment investment is made up of $7.2 million from Canterbury DHB and $1.5 million from the Advance Ashburton Community Foundation.

“The Ashburton project is part of the Government’s wider plans to redevelop Canterbury DHB’s hospitals which is expected to cost more than half a billion dollars,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“I also acknowledge the generous contribution from the Advance Ashburton Community Foundation towards the redevelopment. This demonstrates to me the strength of the local commitment to this hospital.

“The new theatre and procedure room will enable surgical services to continue to be provided at Ashburton Hospital and ensure community access to these services long term.

“And the extension of the Acute Admitting Area will accommodate future growth in this service.”

The redevelopment project will include demolition of seismically unsafe buildings; construction of a new theatre and procedure room; earthquake strengthening and refurbishment of the ward blocks; and an extension to the current Acute Admitting Area.
