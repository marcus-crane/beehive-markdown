A stronger economy is underpinning tax revenue and, combined with responsible control over spending, kept the OBEGAL deficit below $4 billion in the 10 months to 30 April, Finance Minister Bill English says.

The $3.99 billion deficit is $664 million smaller than in the latest forecasts finalised before the Budget.

“A number of indicators confirm that New Zealanders can look to the future with some well-earned confidence and optimism,” Mr English says. “The economy is growing more strongly, new jobs are being created, unemployment is coming down and business and consumer confidence have picked up.

“The Government is supporting these positive trends with a common-sense economic programme focused on giving businesses the confidence to invest, grow and create new jobs. The plan is working and the benefits are starting to show through in the Government’s finances, as we remain on track to surplus in 2014/15.”

In particular, in the 10 months to 30 April, core Crown tax revenue was $3.1 billion higher than in the corresponding period the previous year. This was due mainly to increases in source deductions and other individuals’ tax, and we are also seeing benefits from the Government’s tax package in 2010 broadening the tax base.

At the same time, the Government is keeping control of its spending, with core Crown spending slightly below forecast at $57.8 billion. Net core Crown debt at $60 billion – or 28.7 per cent of GDP – was $441 million below forecast as at 30 April.

“It’s important that we cap and then start reducing this debt by sticking to sound fiscal and economic management,” Mr English says. “That will allow us to meet our second fiscal target of reducing net debt to no more than 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.”
