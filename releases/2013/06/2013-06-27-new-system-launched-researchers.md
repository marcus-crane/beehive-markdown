Researchers will be able to access certain statistical data through a secure system launched this week, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Researchers approved by the Government Statistician can now remotely access microdata about people, households or businesses, but with identifying characteristics removed.

Until now, researchers used Statistics New Zealand’s data labs to access this information.

“Allowing microdata to be accessed remotely through a secure system will reduce time and travel costs, and create more opportunities for data to be reused.

“It also contributes to the Government objective to have all public sector agencies releasing high value public data for re-use,” Maurice Williamson says.

Microdata enables researchers to create valuable new analysis.

“An example of this is the geo located index of deprivation created from microdata by Otago University. The index is a good example of how high value, non-personal data can be safely opened up for re-use without compromising privacy.

“Such data also creates opportunities for increased efficiency through interagency collaboration,” Maurice Williamson says.

All microdata sessions are monitored by Statistics New Zealand and researchers are required to follow stringent rules.
