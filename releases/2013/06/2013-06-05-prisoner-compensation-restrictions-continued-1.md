A Bill to ensure victims of crime can continue to seek a share of financial compensation received by prisoners passed its third and final reading in Parliament today.

The Prisoners’ and Victims’ Claims (Continuation and Reform) Amendment Bill makes permanent the Prisoners’ and Victims’ Claims Act 2005, which would otherwise expire on 30 June this year.

“The Bill ensures offenders will not receive compensation for wrongful treatment while in custody, without first having to repay the debt they owe for the harm they caused to their victims,” says Justice Minister Judith Collins.

The Act guides and restricts the circumstances in which courts can award compensation to prisoners. This ensures damages are only awarded to prisoners if no other form of remedy is appropriate.

If compensation is awarded, the Act allows certain deductions to be made before any money is paid to the prisoner.

This includes deductions to pay back any legal aid received in relation to the claim, and any outstanding reparation payments.

The Act also provides a simplified process for victims making claims against compensation payments seeking redress for the harm they suffered. This can include claims for emotional harm or property damage or loss caused by an offender.

“The Bill will ensure victims of prisoners who are awarded compensation continue to have a priority claim to a share of any payments,” Ms Collins says.
