The passing of the third and final reading of the Education Amendment Bill in Parliament this afternoon, paves the way for the first Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua to open at the start of the next school year.

Associate Education Minister John Banks says Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua will improve the life chances of students who are currently being left behind.

“Partnership Schools will have more flexibility in how they operate, allowing them to target disadvantaged students in innovative ways. The schools will be expected to meet strict targets for improving educational outcomes,” Mr Banks says.

“Partnership Schools will provide new opportunities for the education, community and business sectors to work together to raise achievement, and deliver much needed choice for students, parents and whānau.

“We must do more to give all students the opportunity to succeed - especially those from Māori and Pasifika backgrounds, from disadvantaged homes, or with special educational needs, all of whom are not well served by the current system.”

Mr Banks says there have been 35 applications from around the country to run Partnership Schools.

“The Partnership Schools Authorisation Board is carrying out a thorough and robust evaluation process and I am confident all Partnership Schools will be run by organisations of the highest calibre.

“I look forward to the announcement of the successful applicants in the coming weeks. Roll on day one, term one, 2014.”
