Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today launched a nationwide programme which will see 13,000 driveways at state houses made safer for children.

“New Zealand has one of the highest rates of child driveway safety accidents in the world. It is estimated that a child is hospitalised every two weeks and five children die a year as a result of being run-over in driveways. These tragic accidents are over-represented at Housing New Zealand properties, which is why we are launching this major driveway safety programme to help keep kids safe,” Dr Smith says.

Dr Smith launched the programme at a state house in Porirua which is one of the first to be upgraded with new driveway safety features.

“This programme focuses on separating driveways from play areas and installing interventions such as fencing, self-closing gates, speed restriction signs, speed humps, and convex mirrors to prevent driveway safety accidents from occurring,” he says.

“Earlier this year Housing New Zealand inspected more than 13,000 state houses where children under five live. Work has now begun nationally to make driveways safer at more than 4,000 high priority properties by June next year. The $30 million programme is expected to be completed within four years.”

Housing New Zealand is working with Safekids Aotearoa (the injury prevention service of Starship Children’s health) to promote key driveway safety messages including checking for children before driving off, always supervising children around vehicles, separating play areas from driveways and slowing down.

“It is very good news to learn that last week our driveway safety programme took out the Australasian Housing Institute’s annual award for leading innovation,” Housing New Zealand Chief Executive Glen Sowry says.

“The safety of our tenants is very important to us and as well as the retrofitting work we are doing at existing properties, we are now including driveway safety in our guidelines for building new state homes,” Mr Sowry says.

“This practical Government initiative is about saving the lives of young children from needless accidents in driveways. We need to make these properties safer but also get a safety message away to families about the dangers of driveways so fewer children are maimed or killed,” Dr Smith says.
