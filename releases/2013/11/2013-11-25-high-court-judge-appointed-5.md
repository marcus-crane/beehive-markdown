Deputy Solicitor-General (Criminal Group) Cameron Mander has been appointed a Judge of the High Court, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Cameron Mander graduated with an LLB from Victoria University in 1985 and was initially employed at Parliamentary Services, in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, before joining Wellington firm Luke Cunningham and Clere as a staff solicitor the following year.

In 1989 he travelled to London where he was admitted to the Roll of Solicitors of England and Wales and employed as a litigation solicitor by Clifford Chance.  While in England, he obtained an LLM (Hons) from Cambridge University. In 1992 he returned to New Zealand and rejoined Luke Cunningham and Clere as a partner, practising as a senior crown prosecutor and litigator in support of both the Crown Solicitor and the firm’s private practice.

In 2007 he joined the Crown Law Office as a Deputy Solicitor-General where he was responsible for the work and litigation practices of both Criminal and, until recently, Human Rights Teams.

As Deputy Solicitor-General, he led the oversight and supervision of the Crown Solicitors Network, was a member of the Chief Justice’s Criminal Practice Committee and the sub-committee of the Rules Committee drafting the rules for the Criminal Procedure Act 2012, and was responsible for the Crown’s representation before the Royal Commission into the Pike River Mine Tragedy in 2011.

The new Judge will sit in Christchurch.
