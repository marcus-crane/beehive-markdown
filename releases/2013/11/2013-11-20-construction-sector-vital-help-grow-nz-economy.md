The construction sector is one of largest in the New Zealand economy employing 7 per cent of the workforce and growing, a new Government report shows.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today released the *Construction Sector Report*, the fourth in a series of seven that make up the New Zealand Sectors Reports Series 2013. These provide detailed information about the economy and are designed to support the Government’s Business Growth Agenda by improving understanding of the economy. 

“The construction sector generates annual revenues of more than $30 billion to the New Zealand economy. It employs 170,000 people – more than the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors,” Mr Joyce says.

“The number of firms is 10,000 higher than in 2002. This has been driven by construction services and residential building. With the Christchurch rebuild and Auckland city housing demand at an all-time high, the industry is experiencing unprecedented growth.

“The challenge of the industry is the cyclical ‘boom and bust’ nature that tends to obstruct growth in the long term. Through the Business Growth Agenda, the Government has set out 58 specific initiatives that directly relate to increasing productivity in the sector, growing innovation and creating safer workplaces in an effort to reduce its cyclical nature.”

The Government has formed a number of strategic sector partnerships: the Building and Construction Productivity Partnership with industry groups, the Auckland Housing Accord with the Auckland City Council, and it continues to work with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority with support from many Government agencies.

“Construction has a vital part to play in our communities and its activity can be felt throughout the economy. From infrastructure and telecommunications to city and community development, it has a direct impact on the quality of life of all New Zealanders,” Mr Joyce says.

“Importantly, demand from the construction sector drives a wide range of other activities in the economy. Most of us deal with this sector regularly whether through repairs in our home, rewiring, repainting or even building a new house. It is part of the fabric of society and that is why this sector is so important.”
