Education Minister Hekia Parata today released information on the educational performance and outcomes of Pasifika students, from early childhood education through to NCEA.

“The information delivers on my commitment to provide public metrics on education performance, so that parents and the wider community know where success is occurring but just as importantly where we can work together to lift achievement,” Ms Parata says.

“This information provides us with a clear picture of participation rates of our Pasifika children in early childhood education, achievement in National Standards at primary school, and NCEA success.”

The latest Pasifika profile shows:

- **Early Childhood Education**: participation has increased since 2012 to 88.6 per cent in 2013, though remains below the national average of 95.8 per cent
- **National standards:** 62.6 per cent of Pasifika students are achieving at or above the National Standard in Reading; 59.7 per cent in Mathematics and 56.8 per cent  in Writing in comparison to the national average of 77.4 per cent in reading, 73.6 per cent in Mathematics and 70 per cent in writing
- **NCEA:** The percentage of Pasifika students achieving NCEA Levels 1 and 2 increased in 2012.  Figures for 18 year olds achieving at Level 2 rose by 2.6 per cent from 2011 to 68.1 per cent

“Being armed with this information means everyone involved can contribute to achieving better outcomes for Pasifika learners – from teachers and schools to parents, aiga and communities. 

“We want to see our Pasifika students participate, engage and achieve in education. We want to see them choosing pathways to higher education, to further training, or to employment.

“Our Youth Guarantee offers a range of options and together with our Better Public Service target to get 85 per cent of 18 year olds gaining NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification by 2017, we expect to see more Pasifika achieving.

“This Government’s education plan is about giving all of our children a better education and raising achievement for five out of five of our kids. We are determined to see Pasifika achievement continue to rise as part of that plan.”
