Education Minister Hekia Parata has appointed six new board members to the Pacific Islands Polynesian Education Foundation to continue to grow the Foundation and its relationships with education providers.

Speaking at a Foundation event last night, Minister Parata said she was delighted with the new appointments to the board. “They are outstanding individuals who come highly recommended by their communities.”

The new board members are:

- Aolele Su’a Aloese, Chairperson
- Maureen Ariki Tukaroa-Betham
- Gina Huakau
- Tele’a Andrews
- Lynsey Talagi
- Everdina Johanna Salapima Fuli

“Harnessing their passion, I can see that this board is going to achieve great things with the Foundation, the Scholarships it provides, and for our Pasifika students.

“I am sure the new board will not only sustain the progress already made for the Foundation, but push it further and bring a fresh and innovative direction to their work.”

“I would also like to thank the outgoing board for the work they undertook on behalf of Pacific Island students and the dedicated service they have provided for over 10 years,” Ms Parata says. “They have made a real difference.”

“In 2012, 6,741 18-year-old Pasifika students achieved NCEA Level 2, up 2.6% from 2011 when only 65.5% were getting the same result. The results show that our Pasifika students are moving in the right direction. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement.

“This Government is focussed on providing a wide range of programmes to make education more accessible and meaningful to our Pasifika young people. The Pacific Islands Polynesian Education Foundation makes an important contribution to that.”

“I was inspired by the speakers celebrating the outgoing board members and welcoming the incoming members, all of whom were scholarship holders and have gone on to be well qualified and realise the potential the Board saw in them.”

“Tolo Pereira, Arden Perrot and Teresia Teaiwa gave very different, very personal accounts of what a great education has done for them - it was inspirational.”

The Pacific Islands Polynesian Education Foundation, which was established in 1972, promotes and encourages better education for Pacific Islanders and provides tertiary scholarships to meet this aim.
