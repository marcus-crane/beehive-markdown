Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the start of a new funding round for the Community Development Scheme. 

“The fund enables groups to employ a community development project worker to help them identify and respond to local issues,” says Mrs Goodhew.

During each funding round, applications for the scheme are invited from community organisations, hapū, and iwi based in specific areas.

“To ensure the funding gets distributed overtime, the Department of Internal Affairs issues a list of locations where the group’s projects must operate.

“This list is based on what regions have previously received funding, census data and input from the DIA’s regional offices,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Organisations applying for funds must be community based, use a community or hapū development approach and have support from within the community.

“They must also have the proven capability and procedures to deliver and manage the project effectively.

“This government recognises the essential community-focused work carried out across the country, and we are committed to supporting effective, targeted and well managed projects,” says Mrs Goodhew. 

This year’s funding will be available in: Clutha/Dunedin city, Far North district, Invercargill city, Marlborough, Ruapehu/ Taupo-Turangi, South Taranaki, South Wairarapa, Tararua, Waikato, Westland and the Whangarei district.
