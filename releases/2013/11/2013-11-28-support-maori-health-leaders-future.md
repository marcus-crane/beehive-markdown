Associate Minister of Health Tariana Turia has congratulated the five recipients of the 2013 John McLeod Scholarships and Te Apa Mareikura Awards held at Te Papa Tongarewa Museum in Wellington last night.

“These awards recognise the work and absolute commitment by our emerging talent to reduce the disparities that still exist in our community between Maori and non-Maori.  While the recipients have achieved academic success and medical qualifications, they are also grounded in the issues that affect whanau, hapu and iwi,” says Minister Turia.

The 2013 John McLeod award winners are:

- Marise Kerehi Stuart (Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa, Ngapuhi)

<!--THE END-->

- Coralie Takuira Dargaville  (Te Rarawa, Ngapuhi)

The 2013 Te Apa Mareikura Award winners are:

- Peetikuia (Peeti) Wainui (Ngariki Kaiputahi, Te Aitanga a Mahaki, Ngati Porou, Ngai Tuhoe, Ngati Pikiao)

<!--THE END-->

- Roy Hoerara (Ngati Porou, Ngati Kahungunu ki Wairarapa)

<!--THE END-->

- Ngahieki Sonia-Marie (Sonia) Stewart (Te Whanau a Apanui, Te Whakatohea, Ngai Tuhoe, Maniapoto-Waikato)

**About the scholarships and awards**

The John McLeod scholarships are awarded in memory of the late Dr John McLeod (Ngapuhi), who was nationally and internationally renowned for his work in public health, and for his significant contribution toward improving Maori health. These scholarships are presented to high academic achievers who also show selfless commitment to their colleagues and communities.

Te Apa Mareikura Awards acknowledge contributions made to Maori health by four distinguished community leaders: Rongowhakaata Wirepa (Ngati Porou, Te Whanau-a-Apanui, Rongowhakaata); Anne Delamere (Te Whanau-a-Apanui, Te Arawa); Denis Simpson (Ngati Awa, Tuhourangi) and Bill Katene (Ngati Toa Rangatira).   The Awards recognise involvement in community health, proven leadership and effective community networks, alongside academic excellence. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Hauora Maori Scholarships are funded by the Ministry of Health with the aim of building Maori workforce capacity in the health sector by providing financial assistance to students who are studying a New Zealand Qualifications Authority accredited course in health and disability studies across 11 health categories - 653 Hauora Maori scholarships were awarded this year.

**Marise Kerehi Stuart**  *Ngati Kahungunu ki Wairarapa, Nga Puhi*

In 2013 Marise Stuart completed her fifth year of study for a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Otago.  Marise initially completed a Bachelor of Pharmacology and a Bachelor of Physical Education, which highlighted for her the importance of both preventative health and treatment strategies and inspired her to enter medicine. 

During her studies she has worked in a multidisciplinary health centre in her Wairarapa rohe, at Bay of Islands Hospital, in the rohe of Ngapuhi and at Health Workforce New Zealand within the Ministry of Health, examining the diversities of workforce supply in different health sectors including Maori Health, Pacific Health Rehabilitative Medicine and Aged Care.

Marise is committed to improving Maori longevity.  She aspires to making a positive difference to the lives of her patients by helping them at an earlier stage, and advocating on lifestyle changes that will enable them to live longer and more fulfilling lives. 

**Coralie Takuira Dargaville** *Te Rarawa, Ngapuhi*

Coralie Dargaville graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical neuroscience in 2007 and a Bachelor of Science Honours, First Class in Physiology in 2008.  In 2013 she completed her third year of study for a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery. 

Prior to studying Medicine, Coralie was a Research Technician for four years in the Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology at the University of Auckland.  Her research focused on diabetes and cancer, and she has recently had a journal article published in a UK biochemical journal. 

Her voluntary work has included placements at Auckland City Hospital in a range of surgical wards and a role as a practical adviser for Masters students at the University of Auckland.  Through her work in science and medicine, and support from her family, Coralie is committed to her goal of becoming a Maori Health Practitioner ready to shape the future and lead change.

Roy’s work experience has included 15 years (1983 to 1998) as an analyst and policy manager within the Maori Affairs portfolio of the Public Service.  After this, he worked as a consultant specialising in Treaty of Waitangi facilitation, relationship management and public health.  For more than seven years he has worked closely with the Pharmaceutical Management Agency and Māori communities providing leadership with the One Heart Many Lives (OHML) cardiovascular programme.
