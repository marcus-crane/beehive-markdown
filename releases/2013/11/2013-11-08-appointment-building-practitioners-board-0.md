Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced Catherine Taylor has been appointed an acting member of the Building Practitioners Board.

Ms Taylor’s appointment, which follows the death of board member Bill Smith in September, is for a term of one year and 10 months.

“Catherine Taylor has held senior management positions in both the private and public sector, including five years as Maritime New Zealand’s chief executive. Her governance experience will be invaluable to the Board,” Mr Williamson says.

The Building Practitioners Board was established under section 341 of the Building Act 2004. Its functions are to approve rules relating to licensed building practitioners, investigate, hear complaints and discipline licensed building practitioners and hear appeals against decisions of the Registrar in accordance with the Act.
