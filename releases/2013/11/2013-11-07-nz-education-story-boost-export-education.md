Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today launched the ‘New Zealand Education Story’ to provide a clear, consistent view of New Zealand’s international education industry for prospective students and their families.

The ‘New Zealand Education Story’ is based on the ‘New Zealand Story’ global New Zealand branding toolkit launched by the Prime Minister and Minister Joyce in Wellington yesterday.

“The New Zealand Story profiles our innovation, our warmth and friendliness, and our place in the world with the “Open places, open hearts and open minds” theme. The New Zealand Education story builds on these attributes with a specific focus on our growing International Education sector,” Mr Joyce says.

The ‘New Zealand Education Story’ is articulated in a captivating two-minute video, and is complemented by a marketing toolkit containing photographs, logos, branded templates and presentations that industry participants can use when marketing their education sector, institution or business.

“New Zealand education has much to offer the millions of students around the world looking for overseas study options, as well as the countries looking for credible, high-quality education partners. New Zealand offers a world class education system that focuses on innovation and creative thinking, with excellent lifestyle options in a safe multi-cultural environment. The ‘New Zealand Education Story’ is a great way to tell audiences across the globe about the unique benefits of our education in an emotionally engaging and inspiring way,” Mr Joyce says.

“By first introducing New Zealand’s high-quality education offerings to prospective students and education partners through the ‘New Zealand Education Story’, our international education providers and institutions can then spend more time talking about their specific offerings within the context of the wider New Zealand brand.”

International education is New Zealand’s fifth largest export earner, contributing $2.6 billion to New Zealand’s economy every year and supporting 28,000 jobs.

“International students are vital to New Zealand, both in terms of the economic contribution they make while they are studying in our country and particularly as ambassadors for New Zealand when they return home,” Mr Joyce says.

“There are tremendous opportunities for New Zealand to significantly grow our international education industry and the ‘New Zealand Education Story’ will help us enormously in making the most of those opportunities in an increasingly competitive world.”
