Health Minister Tony Ryall says the latest health target results show more New Zealanders are receiving treatment, with public hospitals delivering over 40,000 elective surgical operations between July and September this year.

“This result is almost 2000 more than the target set, and is another positive reflection on the progress made over the past five years on getting people the surgery they need,’ says Mr Ryall.

Quarterly national health target results released today show health services for New Zealanders continue to improve.

“Over 14,000 babies were fully immunised by eight months of age, and protected against childhood diseases like whooping cough – this is 91 per cent of those eligible,” says Mr Ryall.

“The number of people receiving support to quit smoking is higher than ever before. While more work is still needed, the amount of patients receiving this support from their GPs has increased 21 per cent since results were first published a year ago.

“Almost 880,000 Kiwis have had heart and diabetes checks in the five years to the end of September – a 2 per cent increase on the last quarter.

“Like every winter, the shorter stays in emergency departments result dropped over the past quarter. It was however the best result we have had over the winter months since the targets began.

“3356 patients who were ready for treatment received their radiotherapy or chemotherapy within four weeks. Three patients waited between one and six days longer than the four week target.

“Having three patients delayed in receiving treatment is disappointing, but the Ministry of Health advises me that the slight delay for these patients is unlikely to have a negative effect on their treatment results.

“There will always be some areas for improvement for district health boards, but overall Kiwis can have confidence in continued improvement across a range of key health targets from their public health services,” said Mr Ryall.

A copy of latest health target results has been published in newspapers, and is also available on the Ministry of Health website.
