Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse today hosted 76 veterans in Parliament to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the War in the Pacific.

“It is an honour to join our veterans in remembering their service and sacrifice for our country,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“It provides them with the opportunity to reminisce with their fellow veterans and remember those who were lost.

“Today’s service will be a memorable occasion for those veterans who were not able to attend the commemoration in New Caledonia earlier in the year.”

In April this year, Mr Woodhouse led a delegation of 84 veterans to New Caledonia to attend commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the War in the Pacific with French and Australian forces.

“It was incredibly moving to attend a service held in New Caledonia, surrounded by the graves and memorials to more than 500 New Zealanders who gave their lives for our nation in the Pacific during the Second World War.

“Today is a further opportunity to remember and reflect 70 years on.”

The War in the Pacific, part of the Second World War, lasted from 7 December 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour naval base, until 2 September 1945, when Japan surrendered.
