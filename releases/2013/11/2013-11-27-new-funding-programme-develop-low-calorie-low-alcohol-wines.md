Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is welcoming a new $17 million research and development project to produce low-calorie, low-alcohol wine.

‘Lifestyle wines' is the Ministry for Primary Industries’ (MPI) newest Primary Growth Partnership (PGP), working to develop this new, promising niche market for New Zealand wine producers.

“It’s great to see innovation like this in New Zealand’s primary sectors and I’m excited that the Government can help it become a reality,” says Mr Guy.

“Research into 'Lifestyle wines' will focus on natural production techniques, giving New Zealand wineries a point of difference to other products on the market which often use fruit juice or manufacturing techniques to lower the alcohol level.

“It will also have real social and health benefits for consumers, reflecting alcohol legislation reforms and upcoming drink drive changes.

“This is a great example of the primary industries and government working together to support research and development, and create high quality, value-added products. It will be major boost to the collective brand of New Zealand wine.

“The direct and indirect economic benefits are expected to be around $285 million per year by the end of 2023,” says Mr Guy.

The programme is a partnership between MPI and the New Zealand wine industry.

A total investment of $16.97 million has been secured for the programme, with MPI committing $8.13 million over seven years, and the balance coming from industry partners as a mixture of cash and in-kind contributions.

The PGP aims to boost productivity and innovation across the primary industries, including the fishing, forestry, red meat, honey, dairy and now the wine sectors.
