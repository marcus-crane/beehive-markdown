Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee and Police Minister Anne Tolley have launched this summer’s road safety campaign, which will focus on preventing deaths and injuries by reducing speed, alongside greater visibility of Police.

For the first time, the reduced speed tolerance is being extended beyond an official holiday period.

A 4km/h speed threshold will be enforced by Police throughout the whole of December and January.

“We want New Zealanders to enjoy their holidays, and to be around to celebrate many more in the years ahead,” Mrs Tolley says.

“The lower road tolls in the last couple of years show that drivers are getting the message, but just one death is too many.

“The evidence shows that reducing speed can play a major part in making our roads safer, and in ensuring that fewer Kiwi families have to suffer the trauma of losing a loved one or being involved in a serious crash.”

Police will also be increasing their visibility to raise awareness of road safety, with a nationwide trial of red and orange highway patrol cars.

28 coloured cars will be rolled out across the country over the next year, as existing vehicles come up for replacement.

“Police and their partner agencies will be working hard over the holidays to ensure that our roads are as safe as possible, and we want drivers to play their part too,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Police will be out in force – so speeding drivers and drink drivers should beware.”

The first orange car will be going to the Tasman district, with a red vehicle on patrol in Northland. The next three coloured cars will be going to Eastern, Waikato and Canterbury districts before Christmas.

Mr Brownlee says the holiday campaign aligns with the government’s Safer Journeys Road Safety Strategy – an across-the-board approach to road safety, looking at all aspects of the road system.

“In recent years we have changed give way rules, lowered alcohol limits for young drivers, launched targeted education for young drivers, strengthened driver licence tests and progressed work on building safer roads.

“Last week I introduced the Land Transport Amendment Bill 2013 to Parliament, which will lower the adult breath alcohol limit from 400 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath to 250mcg.

“Across the board this government takes road safety extremely seriously,” Mr Brownlee says.
