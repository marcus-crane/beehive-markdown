Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand has made an initial contribution of $150,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross to support immediate relief efforts in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan.

“Typhoon Haiyan was one of the largest storms on record and has had a major impact on the Philippines - a country that has recently been hit by successive natural disasters,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealand’s contribution will help the Red Cross maintain emergency supply stocks and carry out impact assessments in affected areas.

“New Zealand will consider further support as the full extent of the damage becomes clear,” Mr McCully says.
