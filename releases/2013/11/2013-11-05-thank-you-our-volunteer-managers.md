Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Jo Goodhew has today acknowledged the important role volunteer managers play in volunteer organisations.

“Today marks International Day for Volunteer Managers. This day recognises the great work of managers of volunteers and thanks them for leading volunteers in our communities across the country,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The international theme for Volunteer Managers Day 2013 is ‘connecting and inspiring’.

“In New Zealand we are taking inspiration from the whakataukī - Mā mua ka kite ā muri, Mā muri ka ora ā mua – which means, those who lead give sight to those who follow. Those who follow give life to those who lead,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Volunteers provide services New Zealanders could not do without. For example, fire fighting, search and rescue, coast guard, surf-lifesaving, meals on wheels, youth mentoring and phone counselling services.

“Volunteers are also the backbone of amateur sports, arts and cultural events, churches, environment projects, and recreational clubs.

“Overall, volunteers contribute about 2.3 per cent to New Zealand's GDP. This is a significant proportion of the total economic contribution of New Zealand's not-for-profit sector, which comprises around 100,000 institutions and relies heavily on volunteers,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“I am thankful that communities can benefit from the work of the skilled, dedicated, professional people who manage volunteers.

Mrs Goodhew also expressed her appreciation for the work of Volunteering New Zealand in providing support, professional development and training to make the work of managers of volunteers a little easier.
