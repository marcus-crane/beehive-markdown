A draft Intelligent Transport Systems Action Plan was released today for public consultation by Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee.

Intelligent transport systems involve the application of advanced technologies (computers, sensors, control, and communications) to transport to help save lives, time, money and energy.

“Intelligent transport systems have the potential to transform the operation of all modes of transport, but it is important that is introduced in a coordinated way so as to get the greatest benefit for New Zealand.

“I have asked the Ministry of Transport to lead the consultation to confirm that the government’s strategic aims are clear and that they will identify and remove barriers to the introduction of intelligent transport systems,” Mr Brownlee says.

New Zealand has some specific challenges to the introduction of intelligent transport systems including our low population density, distance from international markets, the long thin form of the country, and the limited number of alternative routes should State highways or the main trunk line be unavailable.

The draft action plan builds on conversations Ministry of Transport officials had with the intelligent transport systems sector and central government agencies earlier this year.  It explains the government’s strategic context and leadership role.  It takes a high level multimodal, multi-agency approach to the introduction of new intelligent transport system technologies.

Mr Brownlee says New Zealand already has some intelligent transport systems technologies in use.

“Traffic control centres in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch rely heavily on technology to gather information on traffic conditions, adjust traffic signals and provide real-time information for travellers in order to operate the network efficiently.

“These deliver real-time congestion information to road users, and are increasing the carrying capacity of the Auckland motorway system by using motorway ramp signals.

“Vehicle manufacturers are also introducing advanced driver assistance systems such as self-parking cars and blind spot warning systems.”
