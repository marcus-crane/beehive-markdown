Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the recipients of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships for 2014.

“I congratulate all the recipients of this year’s Fellowships and wish them successful and productive study trips,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The Trust aims to help New Zealanders from all walks of life to travel overseas and bring back new insights and understanding that will enrich their community and, ultimately, New Zealand as a whole.

“Fellowships widen an individual’s horizons and enable them to grow in confidence, knowledge, authority and ambition. Fellows return with inspiration and networks that support and develop their leadership in their chosen field.”

For 2014 the Trust allocated a total of $82,000 to 13 recipients. Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of travel costs and can spend between three weeks and three months overseas.

Mrs Goodhew said she was particularly pleased to announce the first recipient of the Winston Churchill McNeish Writers Fellowship.

“The writer’s fellowship has been made possible by a very generous donation from Sir James and Lady McNeish to encourage promising young writers and journalists to travel and live in another culture.

“I am happy to announce that Johnny Blades has been awarded the writers fellowship. Mr Blades will be travelling to Papua New Guinea to research a non-fiction book, tracing political and social developments in Melanesia since the turn of the century,” says Mrs Goodhew.
