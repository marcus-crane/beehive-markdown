The Government’s Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update will be issued on Tuesday, 17 December, Finance Minister Bill English announced today.

“The Government is aiming to return to surplus in 2014/15 and we are seeing good momentum building in the economy,” he says.

“Over the past five years, the Government’s economic programme has ensured the most vulnerable New Zealanders have been protected, while at the same time building a more productive and competitive economy capable of providing more jobs and higher incomes.

“We’ve also invested in the rebuilding of Christchurch and ensured we map a path back to surplus so we can avoid the acute debt problems seen in many other countries in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.”

“Having more than halved the operating deficit before gains and losses to $4.4 billion in the latest year to 30 June, the Government is focused on continuing to responsibly manage its finances and getting back to surplus next year.”

The Budget Policy Statement accompanying the Half-Year Update on 17 December will set out some of the Government’s priorities following the return to surplus, Mr English says.

“Surpluses will give us choices about repaying debt, rebuilding EQC, resuming contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and investing further in priority public services,” Mr English says.
