Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says provisional data shows 117 same-sex couples were married in the September quarter.

The first same-sex marriages in New Zealand took place on 19 August and Statistics New Zealand has today released the number of same-sex marriage registrations through to the end of September.

“Marriage registrations of female couples (61) just exceeded those of male couples (56). Forty-seven of the 117 marriages were couples who transferred their civil union to marriage.

“The information also shows one-third of same-sex marriages were to overseas residents, compared with 10 per cent of opposite-sex marriages,” Maurice Williamson says.

There were 33 civil unions registered over the same period, down from 53 in the same quarter a year ago.

For the September quarter there were 2,798 marriages registered in New Zealand.
