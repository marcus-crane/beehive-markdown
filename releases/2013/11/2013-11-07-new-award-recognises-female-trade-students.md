Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has commended Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) for its inaugural Top Female Trade Student Award.

“This award recognises and celebrates the achievements of the growing number of women taking up trade roles,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“I congratulate Joy Lalahi on winning this award. Ms Lalahi completed her pre-trade electrical training through CPIT’s Pasifika Trades Training programme.

“Ms Lalahi is an inspirational woman leading the way in a traditionally male dominated arena. I wish her luck has she completes her electrician apprenticeship.

“I am very encouraged by the increasing number of women taking up trade roles. These jobs can offer good pay and prospects,” said Mrs Goodhew.

The Ministry of Women’s Affairs report, ‘*Building back better: Utilising women’s labour in the Canterbury recovery*’, found there was a pool of underutilised female labour.

“Rebuilding Christchurch is about making the best use of our available workforce and creating a more productive, prosperous Canterbury.

“We need more talented women in the trades. This inaugural award is a very positive step in recognising them.

“CPIT has taken a step further to encourage future tradeswomen by launching a range of Women in Trades scholarships.

“These scholarships will help recipients realise their potential, and open the door to a greater number of tradeswomen,” says Mrs Goodhew.
