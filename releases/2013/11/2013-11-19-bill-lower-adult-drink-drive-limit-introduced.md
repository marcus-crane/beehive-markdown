Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has today introduced legislation that will lower the adult drink-driving limits.

The Land Transport Amendment Bill 2013 will lower the adult breath alcohol limit from 400 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath to 250mcg.

“This change will make our roads safer, save lives and prevent serious injuries,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Alcohol and driving continues to be a major problem in New Zealand, with alcohol-impaired drivers being involved in around 30 per cent of fatal crashes annually.

“I am heartened by the positive reaction to this change. I am confident that lowering the adult drink-drive limit will make a difference to our road toll without needing to criminalise people at the lower level of the offending range.”

Drivers who commit an offence between 251-400mcg of breath will face a $200 infringement fee and will receive 50 demerit points. Drivers in this range will not be able to elect an evidential blood test. Drivers who accumulate 100 or more demerit points from driving offences within two years receive a three month suspension of their driver licence.

Mr Brownlee says the infringement regime is not a soft option.

“The allocation of 50 demerit points is expected to deter the majority of people who value having a driver’s licence.”

The Bill is expected to be referred to a select committee before Christmas and passed in 2014, with a commencement date of 1 December 2014.
