New Zealand will be among the strongest developed economies in the world over the next few years, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s latest annual Economic Outlook published overnight.

The OECD is forecasting annual economic growth in New Zealand of 2.4 per cent and 3.6 per cent over the next two calendar years, and for the current account deficit to narrow to less than 4 per cent of gross domestic product.

“This is the latest in a series of encouraging reports on the New Zealand economy, which confirms that we are well placed compared to most other countries,” Mr English says.

“The OECD’s growth forecast of 3.6 per cent in calendar 2014 puts New Zealand in the top six developed economy growth rates. It’s above the OECD average of 2.4 per cent and better than Australia at 2.7 per cent.

“As the OECD notes, although the severe drought earlier this year depressed agricultural production and exports in the second quarter, underlying growth in the New Zealand economy has been strong.

“And it describes the Government’s fiscal prudence in setting a path back to surplus in 2014/15 as appropriate.”

The OECD is also forecasting an improvement in the current account deficit.

“Although this longstanding imbalance remains a vulnerability for New Zealand, the OECD expects some improvement over the next three years,” Mr English says. “It forecasts the deficit will narrow from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2014.

“We still have more work to do, but this is significantly better than the current account deficits of more than 8 per cent of GDP five years ago and shows that we are making progress towards paying our way in the world.

“Overall, the OECD forecasts confirm the Government’s economic programme is taking New Zealand’s economy in the right direction and that we are well placed compared to many other countries,” Mr English says.

“This is the best way to support jobs and raise New Zealanders living standards.”
