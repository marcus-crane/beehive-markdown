Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the *Science and Society project*, a unique joint education-science sector plan to lift engagement and achievement in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) across New Zealand.

The Science and Society project has been developed by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment and the Ministry of Education, in response to the National Science Challenges Panel’s additional leadership challenge to improve the understanding, skills and adoption of science and technology in New Zealand society. 

The objectives of the project are to:

- Increase science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills of young people to meet the needs of 21st century life and the labour market, and
- Improve science literacy across the population.

“New Zealand needs more people with maths and science skills in our workforce to help us be internationally competitive and to meet future labour-market needs, particularly in areas where there are shortages such as engineering, ICT, health and agricultural sciences,” Mr Joyce says. “This project will co-ordinate efforts across Government to lift New Zealand’s science and mathematical literacy.”

“The Science and Society project is a unique opportunity for the education and science sectors to work together and increase scientific literacy. It will target a range of areas including, for example, helping to address National Standards figures which show that one third of young people are achieving below the national standards for maths in years 7 and 8,” Ms Parata says.

The project has started with a stocktake of existing programs, and will be developing a strategic plan and a list of key initiatives. A reference group of experts will be established to advise officials and joint ministers on the draft project plan. The Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Sir Peter Gluckman, will chair that group.

The draft plan will be publicly consulted on and the final project plan is expected to be published and adopted by June next year.
