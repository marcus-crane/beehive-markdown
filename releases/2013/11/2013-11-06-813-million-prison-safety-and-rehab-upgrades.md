Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says $81.3 million is being invested in upgrading five prisons to improve security and safety, and to provide better facilities for prisoner rehabilitation and training.

Major infrastructure work will begin soon at Invercargill, Whanganui and Tongariro Prisons, while development is already underway at Waikeria and Rolleston Prisons.

This follows the announcement that the maximum security wing at Auckland Prison is to be completely rebuilt, at a cost of over $200 million, to provide a secure and modern facility which will contain a mental health unit and deliver improved rehabilitation opportunities.

“Our prisons need to be fit for purpose to deliver the results expected by the public,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We are doing everything we can to keep the public and prison staff safe, while at the same time doing more than ever before to educate and rehabilitate prisoners so they don’t create more victims of crime.

“Prisoners are quite rightly being punished for their crimes, but the vast majority are released back into our communities.

“If we can provide opportunities to help them turn their lives around to stop them from reoffending, we can make communities safer and prevent the taxpayer having to foot the $100,000 a year it costs to keep a prisoner locked up.

“The major upgrades at these five prisons will make a valuable contribution to our target of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017. Corrections is already over 11 per cent of the way to achieving that goal, but a lot of hard work lies ahead as we aim to have 18,500 fewer victims of crime each year.”
