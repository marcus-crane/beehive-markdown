Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says while it is disappointing the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) did not agree to a Ross Sea region Marine Protected Area (MPA), engagement on the proposal was constructive.

“The Ross Sea region MPA proposal continued to gather support at this year’s CCAMLR meeting in Hobart. All countries were at the table and negotiating,” Mr McCully says.

“Getting every country in CCAMLR to agree was always going to be a challenge, but the growing momentum behind the proposal gives real reason to hope that the last few reluctant members will eventually offer their support.

“We have made huge strides since last October when the proposal was first presented. Many more countries now actively support the proposal in its revised form.”

Mr McCully says New Zealand will continue to work with other CCAMLR members and the proposal will be presented again at next year’s meeting.

“The Ross Sea region is one of the most pristine natural environments in the world and New Zealand will continue its fight to protect it.”
