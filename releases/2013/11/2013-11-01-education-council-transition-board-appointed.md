Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced appointments to a Board that will oversee the transition from the existing New Zealand Teachers Council to the proposed Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.

“A smooth transition from the current New Zealand Teachers Council to the new body, and its amplified role, will be crucial for embedding the new Council. I have appointed a Board that I believe will achieve this,” Ms Parata says.  

The core tasks of the Transition Board are to:

- Develop a vision and mission for the new Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.
- Propose a strategic plan for the new body.
- Recruit an interim Chief Executive for the new body.
- Ensure business continuity and maintenance of critical capabilities of the New Zealand Teachers Council.
- Ensure optimal engagement and communication with the current New Zealand Teachers Council staff to ensure a smooth transition.
- Oversee the transfer of functions, assets, liabilities and employees from the New Zealand Teachers Council to the new body.
- Engage with the Ministry of Education and other key stakeholders over transition issues.
- Provide updates and advice to the Minister of Education (and other Ministers as relevant) as required.

“I am appointing Nancy Bell, Hon Steve Maharey, Paul Mathews, John Morris, Hoana Pearson, Richard Newton, Professor Graham Hingangaroa Smith, Dr Margaret Southwick, Arihia Stirling, Linda Tame and Allan Vester as members of the Transition Board.

“I have appointed John Morris as Chair of the Transition Board and Nancy Bell to the position of Deputy Chair.”

“The members are well-regarded in their respective fields, and bring a comprehensive range of skills and experience to the task of establishing a new professional body.”

The New Zealand Teachers Council will continue until legislation is enacted to establish the proposed new Council.

Ms Parata acknowledges the valuable contribution of the New Zealand Teachers Council since its establishment in 2002, and the work of the Board and staff over that time.

“In particular, I would like to thank the current Board for the way they have carried out their work over the last few years while a series of reviews have occurred and wide spread consultation has been carried out on the recommended changes,” Ms Parata says.

“The feedback I have received is that they are pleased to see a number of matters being dealt with that they have sought to change over time. I expect the Board will continue to manage in an exemplary manner their important work while the legislation is considered and a transition pathway is completed.”
