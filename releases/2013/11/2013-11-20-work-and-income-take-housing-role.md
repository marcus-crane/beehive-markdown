Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says the Ministry of Social Development is well on track to deliver social housing reforms next year.

“From April next year, MSD’s Work and Income will assess and manage the social housing needs of low income New Zealanders,” says Mrs Bennett.

“It makes sense for Work and Income to take on this role, with offices around the country and staff who are familiar with individuals and families in need.”

Work and Income will carry out screening, assessment and eligibility reviews and manage the waitlist as well as referrals to housing providers. 

It will calculate and administer income related rent subsidies, contract and pay housing providers, investigate fraud and recover debt.

A large majority of Housing New Zealand tenants, including those on the waitlist, have either current or previous involvement with MSD.

In future people will avoid having to provide the same information to multiple agencies. 

Work and Income will not only be able to help people with their job search, income support, or superannuation but their housing needs as well.

There will be a stronger focus on ensuring the people most in need receive social housing support, at the right time, for the right amount of time.

“We will look at reviewable tenancies, recognising some people need long term state housing, while others may be able to move on to private rentals as their circumstances change,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We need to prioritise social housing for people with greatest need. That means if circumstances have improved, people need help to move on.”

Mrs Bennett says a more comprehensive service with more advice about housing options and support will be part of the transfer from Housing New Zealand to MSD’s Work and Income. 

This will encourage more people to consider a wider range of housing options such as private rental or home ownership, recognising that these offer many families more choice and better sustainability. 

The Government’s also working with a range of organisations to encourage more community housing.

Income related rent subsidies will be available to approved Community Housing providers so they can play a bigger part in helping people in need.

The Government has already announced a range of initiatives to increase housing supply. 

“I’m confident the Government’s housing reforms will see more people with social housing needs move into affordable, secure housing and those who no longer need state support will get help to move on,” said Mrs Bennett.
