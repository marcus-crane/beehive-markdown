Education Minister Hekia Parata wishes all NCEA students in New Zealand the best during their examinations.

“NCEA examinations begin today and this is a critical time for our students. I urge them to study hard, prepare well and I wish them the very best during their examinations,” Ms Parata says.

The 2012 results released earlier this year showed that 74.3 per cent of school leavers achieved NCEA Level 2 last year compared to 72.4 per cent in 2011. Since 2009, there has been a 10.1 per cent increase.

“This is good news, but we can, and must, do better. The Government’s education plan aims for five out of five students getting the qualifications they need to reach their potential. We want the best for all our students.”

“Principals, teachers and boards are doing a great job supporting our students in school, together with parents and communities. It is the collective effort that is reflected in the increased NCEA results over the last four years.

“We want to see this positive trend increase and I wish all NCEA candidates the very best with their exams this year.”
