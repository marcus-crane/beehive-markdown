Deputy Prime Minister Bill English leaves tomorrow to lead New Zealand’s ministerial delegation to the annual Australian New Zealand Leadership Forum in Sydney.

He will be accompanied by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully, Trade Minister Tim Groser and Commerce Minister Craig Foss.

The ninth Forum, which brings together senior politicians, business and academic leaders from both countries, takes place on Wednesday.

“One of the objectives of this year’s Forum is working together to access opportunities in Asia,” Mr English says.

“It’s now 30 years since CER was established and I’m looking forward to meeting leaders from both sides of the Tasman so we can work together to maximise our opportunities in the region.

“From New Zealand’s perspective, the Forum will allow us to engage with ministers in the new Australian Government and agree on the direction of the trans-Tasman work programme for the coming year. That is important as we agree on the next steps in the Single Economic market between our two countries.”

Mr English will speak at the Forum luncheon on Wednesday, along with Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey. While in Sydney, he will also meet a number of business and political leaders, including New South Wales Treasurer Mike Baird.

He returns to New Zealand on Thursday.
