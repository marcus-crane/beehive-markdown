Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the signing of a new defence co-operation arrangement with Viet Nam.

“This arrangement reaffirms the value New Zealand places on our defence relationship with Viet Nam,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Co-operation formalises our relationship and provides a strong framework to enhance future defence co-operation in areas of mutual interest. It also forms the basis of another important strand in the wider New Zealand-Viet Nam relationship.

“New Zealand has an important stake in the security of the Asia-Pacific region. We are committed to participating in multilateral forums such as the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus. We value our defence relationships with our ASEAN partners which contribute to New Zealand’s security interests in the region, and support our wider political and economic interests.”

Dr Coleman is visiting Viet Nam for the first time from 24-26 November 2013. The Vietnamese Minister of National Defence, General Phung Quang Thanh, and Dr Coleman, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Defence Co-operation which sets out a non-binding framework for defence engagement, visits, exercises, exchanges, and ship visits. The arrangement follows General Thanh’s visit to New Zealand in March where initial discussions were held.
