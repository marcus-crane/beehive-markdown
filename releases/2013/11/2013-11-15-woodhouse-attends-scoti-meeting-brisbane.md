Associate Minister of Transport Michael Woodhouse will represent the New Zealand Government at the 5th meeting of the Standing Council of Transport and Infrastructure (SCOTI) in Brisbane today.

Mr Woodhouse will join his counterparts from both state and federal Australian governments to discuss a wide range of transport issues, with a particular focus on infrastructure.

“This meeting provides an opportunity to further develop the relationship with our Australian counterparts, and learn from each other’s challenges and experiences,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“There is significant interaction by officials between our two countries and policy changes in Australia are sometimes used to inform developments or potential changes in the transport sector in New Zealand.

“I am looking forward to taking part in the discussions and sharing ideas with ministers and officials from across the ditch.”
