The Government has committed a further investment of $53.8 million over four years in early childhood education funding as a result of continued increases in participation numbers, especially amongst Māori and Pasifika children, Education Minister Hekia Parata says.

The latest Ministry of Education figures, for the year ended September 2013, show that the rate is now up to 95.8 per cent with 1,640 more children participating in early childhood education than at the same time last year.

“There is strong growth among Māori children, 92.7 per cent are participating in ECE before starting school. Nearly 400 more Māori children starting school had attended early childhood education than at the same time last year,” Ms Parata says.

“Pasifika participation in early childhood education before school is now at 89.1 per cent and is continuing to improve. Nearly 300 more Pasifika children started school after attending early childhood education compared to this time last year.

“The numbers show that our initiatives to encourage ECE participation are delivering results and the further investment means even more of our youngest New Zealanders will be getting a stronger start in their early learning.

“This Government is serious about raising achievement for five out of five kids. We have set an ambitious Better Public Service target for early childhood education that in 2016, 98 per cent of children starting school will have participated in quality early childhood education.

“We know from New Zealand and international research that the early childhood years are vital to a child’s development and their future ability to learn. This target recognises that each child's education experience will be better for a stronger early start that can be provided through ECE.

The Government will invest $1.5 billion dollars in early childhood education in this financial year which includes the 20 hours ECE subsidy, for both teacher and parent led centres and $43 million in equity funding.

**Notes:**

The EarlyChildhood Education (ECE) Participation contingency fund was included as part of the Budget 2013 package to cover the costs of an increased number of children participating in ECE.
