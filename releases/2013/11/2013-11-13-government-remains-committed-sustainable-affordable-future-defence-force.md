Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman told the Defence Industry Association annual conference today that the Government remains committed to a sustainable and affordable future Defence Force out to 2030.

“The Government inherited a substantial long term funding gap in defence, and the 2010 Defence White Paper signalled that new money would be required over time to maintain and improve NZDF capabilities,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is important New Zealand plays our part in international security. The Government is committed to having a future Defence Force which is capable, sustainable, deployable and affordable.”

The NZDF has undergone a period of significant change, and has focused on moving resources from non-deployable to deployable areas of the NZDF. Progress made on the Savings and Redistribution Programme has resulted in $193 million reinvested into frontline capabilities.

The Defence Mid-Point Rebalancing Review (DMRR) was commissioned by Ministers to develop a robust long term funding plan. It was a thorough analytical process which looked at the costs of various combinations of capabilities that would be able to deliver on the Government’s expectations.

DMRR was a combined effort by NZDF, MoD, Treasury and DPMC. It has been identified as a model process for understanding costs across the public service.

The DMRR has been completed and the Government has agreed to a sustainable long term funding approach for the NZDF out to 2030. The details of the funding will be announced in the Budget. 

“This funding approach allows the NZDF to plan strategically for its long term future, and it will ensure the NZDF can maintain and improve its current mix of capabilities,” says Dr Coleman.

“It will enable the NZDF to meet the Government’s expectations set out in the 2010 Defence White Paper to protect and advance New Zealand’s interests at home, in the South Pacific and globally.

“The NZDF remains committed to making on-going savings and efficiencies as part of its long term future planning. This continued focus is vital for the NZDF to sustain its capability.”
