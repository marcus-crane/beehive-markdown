Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith joined with Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel and a consortium of community social housing providers today to officially unveil plans for a new 44 unit mixed social housing development in Hornby.

"The $12 million Hornby Project is a collaborative partnership between the Government, Christchurch City Council, New Zealand Housing Foundation, Salvation Army, Abbeyfield Partnerships and the Housing Plus Charitable Trust. The project aims to develop an integrated neighbourhood of warm, dry and safe low-cost rental and assisted home ownership opportunities for low-income families and elderly Cantabrians," Dr Smith says.

"The development, which is made up of a range of one-to-four bedroom homes, has received $2.4 million of Government support. The Hornby Project is exactly the type of social housing development we want to see more of under our recently passed legislative reforms to grow the community social housing sector," Dr Smith says.

“Housing is one of our Council's top priorities and this development is a vital step in Christchurch's recovery. Partnerships such as this between local and central government will ensure Christchurch's myriad of housing needs can be met. Our Council will look to pursue future opportunities to work with central government, social housing agencies and the private sector to address our city's needs,” Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel says.

"The Housing Foundation homes are targeted at families struggling to replace homes lost as a result of the earthquakes and first home seekers who cannot achieve independent living on their own but with some initial assistance can realise their home ownership aspirations," Housing Foundation chairman Tony Lanigan says.

"This project is one of many housing initiatives being rolled out to help restore Canterbury's housing stock to pre-earthquake levels. Others include Housing New Zealand's programme to repair 5,000 state houses and build 700 new ones by the end of 2015, the opening of four temporary accommodation villages, a partnership with the private sector to build worker accommodation, and the development of a Land Use Recovery Plan to provide a blueprint for significant new housing developments," Dr Smith says.

The Hornby Project is expected to be completed by early 2015.
