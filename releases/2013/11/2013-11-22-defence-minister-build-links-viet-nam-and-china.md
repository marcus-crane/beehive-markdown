Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman departs for Viet Nam and China this weekend for a series of meetings with his ministerial counterparts and defence officials.

“New Zealand engages with a wide range of defence partners in the Asia-Pacific region, co-operating on matters of common interest,” says Dr Coleman.

“A good example of this co-operation is Exercise Phoenix Spirit, which was held in New Zealand in August, where NZDF, Australian, US and Chinese personnel worked through humanitarian assistance and disaster relief scenarios.

“New Zealand’s defence engagement with China continues to grow, and complements the wider political and economic links between our countries. The NZDF is keen to continue to build its engagement with the People’s Liberation Army.

“New Zealand also has a productive bilateral relationship with Viet Nam and I am looking forward to reciprocating General Phung Quang Thanh’s visit to New Zealand earlier this year.”

Dr Coleman is visiting Viet Nam from 24-26 November 2013, where he will meet with the Minister of National Defence, General Thanh, and visit Cam Ranh Bay Naval Base in Nha Trang. Dr Coleman will then visit China from 27-30 November 2013, where he will meet Minister of National Defense, General Chang Wanquan, and General Zhao Keshi, Director PLA General Logistics Department and Central Military Commission member.
