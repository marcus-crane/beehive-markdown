Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is welcoming public submissions on the Vulnerable Children Bill to be heard from next week.

“The ten-year Children’s Action Plan and Vulnerable Children legislation is the most important work I have done as Minister and New Zealanders continue to have a vital role in shaping this,” says Mrs Bennett.

“I travelled from Kaitaia to Invercargill consulting and engaging with New Zealanders on the Green Paper, almost 10,000 submissions went into the development of the White Paper and this is the next opportunity to speak up.”

Public submissions will be heard in Auckland on Monday the 25th of November and in Wellington on the 28th and 29th of November.

Changes in the Bill include making the heads of five government departments accountable for protecting and improving the lives of vulnerable children.

Relevant government agencies will introduce child protection policies.

“These changes are transformative, policies will change and it will directly affect frontline workers in those departments and they will be putting children at the centre of everything they do.”

Standardised screening and vetting of every person in the Government’s ‘Children’s Workforce’ will be introduced and people with serious convictions will be permanently restricted from working closely with children.

Parents who seriously abuse or even kill children will have to prove they are safe to parent again; if they go on to have another child.

Judges will be enabled to place Child Harm Prevention Orders with specific restrictions on adults who pose a serious risk to children.

“This is a big step to take, but the checks and balances and high thresholds are in place as protection.”

“The Orders will ensure the greatest protection is afforded to children.”

Mrs Bennett says all of these changes will better protect vulnerable children in New Zealand and put their needs ahead of adults.

“This Government has thought long and hard about these changes and we’ve come down on the side of children.”

“I welcome the feedback from the public, community organisations and professionals about the proposed measures,” says Mrs Bennett.
