A Ministry of Health report focusing on health literacy and its relationship to the prevalence of skin infections particularly for Maori children under the age of 15 has identified a number of barriers preventing the effective treatment and management of skin infections. New Zealand has one of the highest rates for childhood skin infections in the western world, with Maori children more than one and a half times more likely than non-Maori to be hospitalised due to skin infections.

The report ‘Health Literacy and the Prevention and Management of Skin Infections’ focused particularly on health literacy experiences among Maori with skin infections arising due to common skin conditions like eczema. It is estimated that 60,000 NZ children visit general practices every year for treatment of skin infections. The report confirms health literacy is a key barrier preventing New Zealanders accessing and understanding the health information and services they need.

“Skin infections can cause discomfort, embarrassment, acute pain and if left untreated,  lead to hospitalisation.   The key thing is knowing how to support our families to reduce the risk,” says Tariana Turia Associate Minister of Health.

“If we want to see more people managing their own health and wellbeing, we need to support greater health literacy and access to good information and advice.”

Health Literacy refers to the degree to which people are able to access and understand essential health information in order to make informed and appropriate health decisions. Over 1.5 million New Zealander’s are estimated as having low levels of health literacy. Between 2005 and 2009 skin infections were the third most common cause of hospitalisations among Maori children, accounting for 10 percent of hospital admissions.

“The report highlighted difficulty in reading and understanding health information, poor communication between health professionals and their patients, and information overload as the key health literacy barriers,” says Mrs Turia.

“Improving health literacy is a combination of ensuring we provide readily accessible health information and advice for patients and their whanau, and improve communication between health professionals and their patients.”

The findings in the report will help health professionals to more effectively assist individuals who experience these conditions, and provide a greater understanding of health literacy issues and barriers from a patient’s perspective.

Initial research by the Ministry of Health indicated that New Zealanders’ general awareness regarding the management and prevention of skin infections was low and that this lack of information contributes to high rates of skin infection and complications – particularly for Maori. 

Workbase Education Trust was engaged to research and highlight possible interventions or approaches for meeting the health literacy needs of Maori and their whanau and help prevent and manage skin infections. 

“We want to improve the way we present information so that it is easily understood and useful for everyone,” says Mrs Turia.

“It’s about making it as simple as possible to navigate our health system so people can easily find and use the information they need to make healthy decisions for themselves and their whanau.”

The research was undertaken by *Workbase Education Trust*, a New Zealand literacy, numeracy and communication skills provider.
