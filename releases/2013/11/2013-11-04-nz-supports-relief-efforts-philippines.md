Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand will provide $850,000 in humanitarian assistance to the Philippines following the recent earthquake and flooding.

An estimated 370,000 people are living in temporary shelters after the 7.2 magnitude quake last month.

“The United Nations has launched an international appeal after an assessment revealed recovery needs are greater than first thought,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand’s assistance package includes $500,000 to the UN, to be delivered by UNICEF, and $100,000 for New Zealand technical expertise to help further assess quake damage and prepare for reconstruction work.”

Mr McCully says a further $250,000 is being provided for urgent water, sanitation and hygiene facilities for the conflict-displaced population of Zamboanga City, where flooding has placed significant pressure on emergency shelters and created serious health risks.
