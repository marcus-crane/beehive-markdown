Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the chairs and deputy chairs of the 20 district health boards (DHBs).

“14 chairs and 13 deputy chairs are continuing in their roles,” says Mr Ryall.

“To encourage greater regional collaboration in the planning and delivery of health services, there are seven chair and deputy chair cross-appointments.

“For example, there are multiple cross-appointments of chairs and deputies in the four Northern region boards and the three boards in the Greater Wellington region.

“It makes good sense to have some members on neighbouring boards as there are overlaps in care provided to patients. Capital & Coast DHB, for instance, provides nearly 35 per cent of Hutt Valley’s elective surgery.

“Four boards will be chaired by elected members – Hawke’s Bay, Capital & Coast, Nelson Marlborough and South Canterbury DHBs.
