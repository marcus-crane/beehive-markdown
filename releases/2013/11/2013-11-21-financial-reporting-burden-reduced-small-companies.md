A Bill removing the requirement for small and medium sized companies to produce complex financial statements has passed its third reading in Parliament.

The Financial Reporting Bill allows shareholders of small and medium sized companies to decide whether the company must prepare financial statements, says Commerce Minister Craig Foss.

“Passing the Bill is part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to improve capital markets and reduce compliance costs. The changes will remove some expensive reporting obligations and can reduce compliance costs for many companies with revenue between $2 and $30 million a year.

“With the financial reporting burden lifted, smaller companies will be able to focus their time and energy on growing their businesses, innovating and creating jobs,” says Mr Foss.

The Bill will also improve the quality of financial reporting by charities and allow the External Reporting Board to issue accounting standards for registered charities.

“The Bill clarifies what is expected of charities, improves the quality of financial reporting and allows easier comparisons between charities,” says Mr Foss.
