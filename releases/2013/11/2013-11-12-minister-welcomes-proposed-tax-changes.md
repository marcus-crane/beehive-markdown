Police Minister Anne Tolley says proposed changes to taxation allowances will mean that Police officers will not be unfairly penalised.

Around 2,100 Police staff would have been liable for additional tax on their plain clothes allowance.

However, the Minister of Revenue has announced there will be changes to the Income Tax Act which will ensure that these officers don’t have to pay any extra for work-related clothing.

“I welcome the decision to change the Act,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I have had a number of meetings with the Minister of Revenue to put the case for Police, and have stressed that Police should not have to make extra payments for clothing which is important to their job.

“I want to thank the Minister for taking this on board.

“These officers will now be able to continue doing their job serving the public, without any extra financial burden.”
