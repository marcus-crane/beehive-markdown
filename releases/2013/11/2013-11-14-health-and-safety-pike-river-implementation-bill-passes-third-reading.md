Labour Minister Simon Bridges welcomed the passage of the Health and Safety (Pike River Implementation) Bill through Parliament. 

“Today marks the passing of the last major milestone in our work to address the 16 recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy,” Mr Bridges says. 

“The Bill creates the WorkSafe New Zealand Act, the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Act and a new Mines Rescue Act. 

“Its passage will see the new stand-alone workplace health and safety regulator, WorkSafe New Zealand, operating from 16 December 2013.  It also paves the way for new mining health and safety regulations, and an expanded and better supported Mines Rescue Service.

“I would like to acknowledge the work of the Expert Reference Group and thank New Zealand’s mining industry and unions in the mining sector for working closely and constructively with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment over the past year.

“The mining sector’s commitment and support for the Pike Implementation programme will ensure we leave a lasting legacy for the Pike River 29 and their families through these new laws and the work of the new regulator.

“Industry leadership will continue to be vital as the new regime beds in.  WorkSafe New Zealand will work closely with businesses to help them adopt and embed the new changes in their workplaces,” Mr Bridges says.
