The Government’s comprehensive Business Growth Agenda is helping New Zealand build a productive and competitive economy to deliver more jobs and higher growth for people around New Zealand, Finance Minister Bill English and Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce say.

The two lead ministers today released the 2013 Progress Report on the Business Growth Agenda, which is an integrated programme of work focusing on the six key inputs businesses need to succeed, grow and add jobs: export markets, capital markets, innovation, skilled and safe workplaces, natural resources, and infrastructure.

“New Zealand is one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD this year. Business and consumer confidence levels are high, with wages and household incomes growing. The Government is on track to return to surplus by 2014/15,” Mr English says.

“The BGA is all about creating the conditions for businesses to invest for jobs and growth, and for regions to take advantage of the enormous opportunities available to them,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand’s regions have lifted New Zealand out of the global financial crisis – with the whole of the South Island having lower unemployment than Auckland and growth rates are strong in regions like Taranaki, the West Coast, and Canterbury.

“Increased exports and international linkages are vital for New Zealand. Key achievements in the last year include signing an economic partnership agreement with Chinese Taipei, the recent launch of the New Zealand Story, progress on the new $402 million New Zealand International Convention Centre, and significant policy and legislative reforms to grow New Zealand’s $2.6 billion international education sector.”

Mr English says New Zealand firms need access to capital to take advantage of opportunities to grow their businesses.

“Key achievements in the last year include the partial floating on the NZX of Mighty River Power and Meridian Energy, with the sell down of Air New Zealand underway,  the passing of the Financial Markets Conduct Act, and the launch of a new service by NZTE – Better by Capital – to help businesses access the right capital at the right time,” Mr English says.

Mr Joyce says significant progress has been made in building innovation in New Zealand.

“New Zealand has some fantastic innovative firms that are taking on the world – and we want to see more of them. We’ve established Callaghan Innovation, a new hi-tech HQ for Kiwi businesses. Business expenditure on research and development has risen by 23 per cent in the last two years to $1.2 billion, driven by the Government’s increased investment in R&D Growth Grants and R&D Project Grants. In the last week the Prime Minister announced $31 million over four years for repayable funding for start-ups,” Mr Joyce says.

“To succeed internationally, New Zealand firms need access to skilled people. Our tertiary system delivered a record number of qualifications in 2012, with the number of domestic students completing a bachelors degree up 23 per cent in two years.

“We’ve reformed industry training to focus on quality and results, and our apprenticeship reboot has got off to a great start with more than 8,000 trainees signing up since March, 67 per cent up on the same period last year. And we’re making the most significant reforms to our workplace health and safety system in 20 years.

The Government is focused on the responsible and efficient development of our natural resources. This summer will see one of the largest petroleum exploration programmes in New Zealand’s history, and we’re also making good progress in unlocking the potential of Māori land. Crown Irrigation Investments will support the development of proposals to maximise economic growth from irrigation.”

Mr English says a lot is being accomplished through the Government’s investment in infrastructure.

“We’ve announced the next generation of transport projects for Auckland, including the City Rail Loop and the East-West link. The Prime Minister announced last week that Transmission Gully will start construction next year.

“More than 320,000 premises are now able to connect to ultra-fast broadband. And we’ve announced the first 11 Special Housing Areas to increase housing supply – the most important way to get on top of housing affordability,” Mr English says.

Nearly half of the around 350 BGA initiatives have now been completed, with many more in the implementation phase. A report in the first half of next year will outline further progress and the future direction of the BGA.

“It’s noteworthy the Opposition opposes almost every single one of the initiatives in the Business Growth Agenda that would create jobs. They claim to be interested in job creation but their actions don’t match their rhetoric,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealanders can be confident that under National they have a Government wholeheartedly committed to investment, jobs and growth.”
