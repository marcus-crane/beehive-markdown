Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss says Auckland residents need to be prepared as analogue television will be switched off this weekend.

Auckland and the upper North Island will be the final region to make the switch to digital television at 2am Sunday 1 December.

“Latest research shows that while most people have taken steps to ensure they are ready, there could be up to 49,000 households left without a working television on Sunday,” says Mr Foss.

“It’s not too late to make the switch and you don’t need a new TV. Almost all televisions can be made digital ready with a new set-top box.

New Zealanders who are already watching Freeview, Sky or Igloo don’t need to make any changes as they are already watching digital television,” says Mr Foss.

The South Island and lower North Island made the switch to digital television earlier this year.
