Commerce Minister Craig Foss today welcomed the appointment of Rob Everett as chief executive of the Financial Markets Authority.

“Mr Everett’s legal and compliance experience will have him well prepared for his role at the FMA and in facilitating the development of fair, efficient and transparent financial markets,” says Mr Foss.

“I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of out-going CEO Sean Hughes. Over the last two years, Mr Hughes has established a visible and proactive regulator of New Zealand’s financial markets. I wish Mr Hughes all the best for the future,” says Mr Foss.

The FMA was established by the government in 2011 and consolidates the regulatory functions previously held across the Securities Commission, the Government Actuary, the Companies Office, and the NZX.

Establishing the FMA was one of the initiatives in the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to build stronger capital markets, and ensure investors are better informed.
