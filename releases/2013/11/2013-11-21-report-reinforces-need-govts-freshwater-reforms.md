Environment Minister Amy Adams and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy have welcomed a water quality report released today by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.

“The report underlines the importance of the Government’s freshwater reform programme, by showing just what could happen with our water quality if we do not have good policy in place to drive more careful and efficient use of our land and water,” Ms Adams says.

“The Government has a package of reform that will lead to more productive and sustainable use of our freshwater resource, and help alleviate the concerns raised in the report.”

The Government’s freshwater reform programme includes a National Objectives Framework, national bottom lines for freshwater, collaborative planning processes, better water accounting and spending hundreds of millions of dollars on freshwater clean-ups.

The Government also plans to legislate for independent environmental reporting that will enhance New Zealanders’ understanding about the state of our environment.

“There is still more work to be done and more debate to be had, but I am confident that with the combined will of our council, communities, iwi, and water users – and with the support of our science community - we will see significant water quality gains within a generation.”

Mr Guy says it is pleasing to see Dr Wright acknowledge that farmers are actively working to reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus leaching into the water from urine and fertiliser.

“Riparian planting and fencing off water ways are very effective at reducing E.coli contamination, as well as managing sediment and phosphorus.

“It was pleasing to see Fonterra’s announcement this week that 20,000kms of waterways have now been fenced to exclude stock access.

“Farmers realise the importance of sustainable environmental practises as the land is their biggest asset and they need to take good care of it. They know that water resources need to be better managed and modern technologies including more efficient irrigation systems and water storage projects will help our overall sustainability.

“The Government is investing heavily in research to tackle the environmental impacts of agriculture. Much of this research is focussed on reducing nutrient loss on-farm, improving effluent management and more efficient irrigation.

“This includes over $100 million jointly invested in Primary Growth Partnership projects, and AgResearch is running ‘Pastoral 21’ to lessen the environmental impacts of farming. This is a $38 million project with funding from DairyNZ, Fonterra, Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand, Beef + Lamb New Zealand and the Ministry of Science & Innovation.”

The Ministers says it is important to note that the modelling in the report is based on trends between 1996 and 2008.

“That means the report does not take account of the significant water quality initiatives introduced by the Government since then, as well as the increasing actions by regional councils, iwi, the farming sector and other water users to better manage water,” the Ministers say.

“For example, many regions, including Canterbury, Southland and Otago, which are highlighted in the report as being of greatest concern, are already well down the track of introducing freshwater objectives and limits to improve water quality. This requirement was introduced in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management in 2011.”
