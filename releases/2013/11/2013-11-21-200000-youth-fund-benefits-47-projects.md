Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that 47 projects will benefit from the Ministry of Youth Development’s Youth Fund 2014 totalling $200,000.

“I am pleased to be announcing that 47 projects will be supporting young people to engage in and contribute to their communities. This is a great way for these young people to develop skills and knowledge in decision-making and leadership,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Youth Fund supports youth designed and led community projects and because of that, it is really important that young people are the ones who recommend which projects should get funding.

“Panels of young people met across the country to assess applications. All panel members had undergone Ministry of Youth Development training on providing input in government decisions that affect them.”

The funded projects include a variety of inspiring and innovative speakers, workshops, mentoring and community events.

“This year, it is fantastic to see such a broad range of young people getting involved in so many different activities. I’m really pleased to fund projects for disabled youth and health promotion,” Ms Kaye says.

The Youth Fund was launched in 2010 and is an on-going fund supporting young people and their communities.
