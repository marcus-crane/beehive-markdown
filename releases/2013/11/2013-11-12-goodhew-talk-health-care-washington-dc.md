Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew heads for Washington DC today to attend the Commonwealth Fund’s 16th International Symposium on Health Care Policy.

“A major theme of the 2013 symposium is how different health systems are delivering high quality, integrated care for people with chronic conditions,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Along with a number of other health ministers from Europe and North America, Mrs Goodhew will participate in panels and policy roundtable events.

“The Symposium provides an excellent opportunity to showcase the innovations in policy and practice that this Government has put in place to ensure the excellence and financial stability of the New Zealand public health system.

“It also provides an opportunity to learn about the approaches taken by other Government’s around the work to address challenges we share, particularly in respect to chronic conditions”, Mrs Goodhew said.
