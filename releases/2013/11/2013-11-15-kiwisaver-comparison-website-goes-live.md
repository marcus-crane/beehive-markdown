Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the launch of an online tool making it easier to compare the fees and performance of different KiwiSaver funds.

“The Sorted KiwiSaver Fund Finder website allows users to compare fees, past performance and service levels of different KiwiSaver funds to make an informed decision about which fund best suits their individual circumstances,” says Mr Foss.

The tool is made possible by the 2013 KiwiSaver periodic disclosure rules which require KiwiSaver providers to much of the information in a simplified and consistent form each quarter.

“The Sorted KiwiSaver Fund Finder brings this information together in one place and allows New Zealanders access to the information they need to decide which KiwiSaver fund is best for them,” says Mr Foss.

“Introducing new periodic disclosure rules for KiwiSaver providers is part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to provide investors better information to compare fund performance.

“This comparison website is designed to encourage KiwiSaver members to compare funds and make an active choice about their retirement savings,” says Mr Foss.

The Sorted KiwiSaver Fund Finder has been created by the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income.
