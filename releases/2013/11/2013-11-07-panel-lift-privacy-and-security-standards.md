Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced a new panel of professional security service providers to help government agencies manage privacy and security issues effectively.

“Agencies will use the services of a company on the panel to obtain external expertise and advice on the strength and suitability of their ICT security processes, or to test the security of their ICT systems,” says Mr Tremain.

“A range of services will be available through the panel, including risk management, security consulting and review, network and application testing, and certification and assurance.

“The panel is part of an on-going programme of work to ensure government agencies are continually lifting privacy and security standards. It also supports initiatives to improve information management in government, outlined in the ICT Strategy and Action Plan to 2017 announced in June."

The panel of twenty-one service providers was selected through a tender process by the Government Chief Information Officer.  It consists of a mix of New Zealand companies and international leaders.  The providers on the panel are:

- Asterisk
- Aura
- Axenic
- Confide
- Datacom
- Deloitte
- Detica
- Ernst and Young

 

- Fronde
- Grant Thornton
- Hewlett Packard
- Insomnia
- Intuisec
- Integration QA
- Johnson Partners
- KPMG

 

- Lateral Security
- Price Waterhouse Coopers
- Resultex
- Security Assessment
- Starfish

 

“Use of the panel will be mandatory for public and non-public service departments, and it will be available to other State services to help them increase capability,” says Mr Tremain.

“As we transform government services and move increasingly into the digital world, we must ensure that we are following best practices in privacy and security so citizens can be confident that their information will be protected.”
