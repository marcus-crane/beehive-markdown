The latest enrolment numbers for the tertiary sector are consistent with forecasts, with a slight decline in total numbers for the first eight months of this year.

Overall in January to August 2013 there were 349,000 domestic students enrolled in formal study with tertiary education providers, which is 0.9 per cent less than the same period in 2012. The number of full-time equivalent domestic students was down slightly to 234,855.

“The numbers reflect a reduction in the number of people in the population aged between 18 and 22, and more people moving back into work and work-based study as the economy recovers” says Tertiary Education Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce.

Under the Single Data Return (SDR) reporting system, comparing August 2012 with August 2013, the figures show:

- Total enrolments (including international students) were down by 0.7 per cent from 395,400 to 393,000
- Domestic degree level enrolments were down by 2083 places or 1.6 per cent
- Domestic honours degree enrolments were up by 870 places or 8.4 per cent
- Domestic masters degree enrolments were up by 70 places or 0.6 per cent
- Domestic doctorate enrolments were down by 68 places or 1.4 per cent.

In the period January to August 2013 there were 3,700 more bachelors degree enrolments by domestic students aged 18 to 24 than in 2010 – an increase of 4.3 per cent.

“The results show that the postgraduate student allowance changes the Government made last year as part of focussing student allowances to students from low-income families and towards achieving a first degree have had little effect on post-graduate enrolments this year”, Mr Joyce says.

“Where there was change in domestic enrolment patterns at other levels of postgraduate study (such as bachelors with honours), this was mostly due to changes in classifications of particular qualifications rather than an actual change in student enrolment behaviour.”

Note: Figures for enrolments at levels 1-2 are boosted by the inclusion of Youth Guarantee fees-free places in the SDR collection from 2013. This includes the addition of new providers in the SDR collection and the reporting of all fees-free places at polytechnics through the SDR. In 2012, these places were separately reported to the TEC for funding purposes and variously reported in the SDR.
