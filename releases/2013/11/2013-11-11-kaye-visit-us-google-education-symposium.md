Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye will travel to the United States today to attend Google’s first Global Education Symposium.

The symposium will be held at Google’s California headquarters. It will be attended by 40 education leaders including Ministers, Secretaries of Education and senior officials from Malaysia, India, Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the United States.

“The symposium includes discussion on education reform and best practice and I will be sharing the work the New Zealand Government is doing in provision of education infrastructure for modern learning environments and 21st Century learning,” Ms Kaye says.

“The three-day trip will include visits to Silicon Valley’s most innovative education and technology companies, including Imagine K12, and schools that are implementing blended learning models utilising interactive digital content and assessment tools.

“I have been invited to present to the symposium on New Zealand’s digital literacy and 21st Century learning programme. Our government is investing $700 million in cutting edge digital infrastructure to ensure Kiwi students are connected and have access to the best learning tools.

“I will also participate in an education technology round table session with a number of young entrepreneurs and visit innovative technology companies including Apple.”
