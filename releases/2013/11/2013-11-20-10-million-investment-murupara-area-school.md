Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that Murupara Area School would be included in the Government’s major school development funding initiative.

“While detailed costs are yet to be finalised, at least $10 million will be committed to redevelop and extend the Murupara school site to upgrade infrastructure, remediate facilities and accommodate an extended roll and curriculum,” Ms Kaye says.

“This will strengthen education in this area and raise student achievement levels by providing modern learning environments for Murupara students. It is great to be able to confirm this work programme today for this community which is fairly remote geographically and will benefit from better infrastructure.

“This presents an opportunity to do more than extend existing facilities. It will ensure the delivery of a sustainable, valuable asset for learners and their community now and well into the future.

“In September Minister Parata and I announced an eight-point plan to transform the way school property is delivered, to better support 21st Century learning environments and improved outcomes for all students.”

The plan includes a $300 million commitment over six years to assist schools facing particularly complex property issues.

“We introduced this initiative to help schools like Murupara address multiple property issues including out-dated infrastructure, defective buildings or space shortages,” Ms Kaye says.

“We are prioritising work to ensure there is no effect on learning environments or a school’s focus on raising student achievement.

“The level of investment recognises the need to deliver modern learning environments while addressing complex property issues impacting ageing facilities like weather-tightness and earthquake resilience,” Ms Kaye says.

Last week Ministers announced a $30 million investment for Freemans Bay School and Southern Cross Campus in Auckland.

The Ministry of Education will develop an integrated, tailored, major development programme for each school in the programme to accelerate works and create cost-efficiencies through central procurement of services and materials.

“The Ministry has overseen construction of 16 schools and numerous major redevelopments since 2009, a number of which have been recognised through industry awards for design and sustainability. It has the expertise, capability and bargaining power to manage major building programmes on behalf of schools and support school leaders to maintain their focus on teaching and learning while redevelopments are underway,” Ms Kaye says.

Work is continuing to identify and prioritise schools for inclusion in the six-year major development programme. The next schools confirmed for works will be announced early next year.
