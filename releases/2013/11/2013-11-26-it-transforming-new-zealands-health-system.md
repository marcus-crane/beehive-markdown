Information technology (IT) is transforming the way doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals care for patients, says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“More and more patients are benefiting from quicker and safer care by allowing health professionals to better share their medical information,” says Mr Ryall.

Mr Ryall today launched two key documents which focus on improving the quality and safety of health care in New Zealand through better IT systems.

An electronic booklet titled ‘Sharing Health Information: Toward better, safer care’ showcasing the strides being made and the updated National Health IT Plan which is the road map for health IT over the next three years.

“The IT plan describes the work that needs to be done in the next three years to provide better information sharing across the health service…and in patient’s homes.

“It’s about having IT systems which talk to each other and allow patients to have the tools to manage more aspects of their own health.

“One of the stories in the booklet highlights the benefits of this. Wellington novelist Blair Polly uses a secure online patient portal to manage aspects of his own healthcare and talk to his GP. 

“Mr Polly has Type 2 diabetes and uses the portal mostly for repeat prescriptions. He is able to log on, see a list of his medications and tick the ones that need renewing, press ‘send’ and then pick up the script from his doctors office.

“If he needs to ask his GP a question, he’ll send a message online instead of phoning and leaving a message for his doctor to return his call. This is a great example of better, sooner, more convenient health care.

Mr Ryall joined Dr Richard Medlicott from Island Bay Medical Centre and three patients using ‘Manage My Health’ at today’s launch.

“Dr Medlicott told me the online portal has made his workload easier to manage and it's a much more direct way to contact his patients. And the patients described the convenience of communicating online with their GP.

“I encourage everyone working in health to read both of these documents and think about their own role in improving the health system. We are all part of this, and we all stand to benefit from the changes underway,” said Mr Ryall.
