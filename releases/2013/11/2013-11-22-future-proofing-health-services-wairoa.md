Health Minister Tony Ryall today officially opened Wairoa’s new $5 million integrated family health centre.

“Today is about future proofing health services in Wairoa,” says Mr Ryall.

“Wairoa people can now see a raft of health professionals under one roof, including general practitioners (GPs), mental health professionals, community health workers, nursing services and visiting hospital specialists.

“Bringing health services closer to people’s homes is a priority for this government.  Having a range of primary and secondary health services working closely together is great for patients. 

“For example, a video link has also been set up between Wairoa’s emergency room and Hawkes Bay Hospital’s emergency department. This link allows Wairoa GPs to consult with hospital specialists in Hawkes Bay to determine if a patient can be safely treated in Wairoa or should be transferred to hospital.

“A real strength of this centre is the inclusion of the Rural Health Learning Centre. The learning centre will encourage more young health professionals to train and work in Wairoa.

Mr Ryall applauded the community for their involvement in the development of their new health centre.

“This centre has been described to me as being designed by the community for the community. I congratulate you all on your hard work and commitment to improving the health of your community and making this health centre a reality,” said Mr Ryall.
