Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says the passing of the Building Amendment Act 2013 today will lead to a more productive, efficient and effective building industry.

The Act has been amended to introduce several new measures to protect consumers and encourage the building and construction sector to ‘build right first time’, delivering good quality, affordable homes.

There is also changes to the types of work that don’t require a building consent, higher penalties for building work without the appropriate consents and additional powers for councils to restrict entry to buildings that may be located near dangerous buildings.

“These changes will make it easier for homeowners and builders to understand their rights and responsibilities. It will ensure homeowners are able to make informed decisions about their homes, which is often their most valuable and treasured asset.

“Further changes will come into force in 2014 including requirements for builders to provide clients with information about their credentials and to enter into a written contract for work over a specified amount.

Breaching these requirements could result in the builder being fined up to $2,000, or, in the case of false information being given to the consumer, a fine of up to $20,000.

The Building Amendment Act will also change the way dams are defined and measured to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the dam safety scheme.
