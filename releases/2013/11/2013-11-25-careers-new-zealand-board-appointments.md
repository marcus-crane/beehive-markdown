Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced three new members and three reappointments to the Careers New Zealand Board, and welcomed the release of the results of the Crown Entity’s Performance Improvement Framework (PIF) review.

"I am appointing a current member of the Board, Dale Karauria, as the Chair of the Board, who brings governance and strategy experience to the role, and a detailed understanding of the pathways from education to work,” Ms Parata says.

"I would like to thank Murray Ward, who has acted in the role following Peter Hughes’ resignation from the Board on his appointment as Secretary for Education, and look forward to his continuing as Deputy Chair of the Board, along with the reappointment of Chris Meade.

"I am also delighted to announce that Patricia Reade, Steve Day and John Ombler, will join the board, bringing a range of strategic and practical experience, regional perspectives, familiarity with labour market demands, and a commitment to better opportunities for young people.

"Careers New Zealand plays a critical role in making sure young New Zealanders have appropriate information and guidance as they transition from school to the workforce. In many ways it sits at the cross roads of skill development and work opportunity, and must work hard to offer its service to both public and private sector users.

"We all know transition from school to further study or employment is a very challenging time for many young people. A critical focus for us is ensuring that young people stay engaged.”

This Government’s Youth Guarantee initiatives, which include a menu of options from vocational pathways, to Trade and Service Academies, and Fees Free places are a part of the overall drive to ensure young people have better choices as a result of greater flexibility and better collaboration between secondary schools, tertiary providers, and employers. Careers New Zealand is central to that work.

"One of the first tasks of this new board will be to review the feedback from the recently completed PIF evaluation and implement its recommendations. I am very pleased that it has shown Careers New Zealand continues to deliver well in the areas of information provision, advice, guidance and resources. It has also noted that the agency needs to improve in aspects of its organisational development.”

Ms Parata acknowledged the contribution of CEO Graeme Benny who is resigning from Careers New Zealand to take up a new position.

"I want to thank Mr Benny for his enthusiasm for working with young people, his tireless outreach to stakeholders and communities of interest, and his stewardship of Careers New Zealand. I wish him well in his next role. The new board will start the process of looking for a replacement as soon as possible.

"I also want to recognise the work of outgoing Board members Bill Noble, Rob Strathdee and Markerita Poutasi, and thank them for their positive contributions to the work of Careers New Zealand.”
