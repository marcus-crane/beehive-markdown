Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of a new member to the Marsden Fund Council.

Professor Vicky Cameron will join the Council for three years from 1 December 2013 and will convene the Marsden Fund Council’s Biomedical Sciences Panel.

“Professor Cameron is a highly regarded researcher with an excellent track record in her field. Her role on the Marsden Fund Council will involve assessing and recommending funding for research proposals each year, overseeing the progress of the successful projects, and helping ensure the relevance and importance of Marsden funded research is communicated to the New Zealand public,” Mr Joyce says.

“I would like to thank her for joining the Marsden Fund Council and welcome the contribution she will make to New Zealand’s science and innovation system.”

The Marsden Fund is New Zealand’s premier fund for supporting research excellence in science, engineering and maths, social sciences and the humanities.

“The Marsden Fund plays an important role in building knowledge and expertise to open future opportunities for New Zealand.  It aims to enhance the quality of research, support the advancement of scientific knowledge in New Zealand, and contribute to the global knowledge base.

“I recently announced that this year the Marsden Fund will invest $59m in 109 new projects over the next three years.”

In addition, Mr Joyce announced today that two members of the Marsden Fund Council have been re-appointed for three year terms, starting on 1 December 2013:

- Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith as a member of the Council and as Convenor of the Social Sciences Panel
- Professor David Williams as a member of the Council and Convenor of the Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry Panel.

The Marsden Fund Council comprises eleven eminent researchers – a Chair, a Deputy-Chair and nine convenors. Each heads a panel in their academic field, and the panel works to assess applications for funding of research projects.
