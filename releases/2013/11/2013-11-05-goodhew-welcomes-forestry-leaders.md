Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew welcomes international participants to the 25th session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission (APFC) in Rotorua today.

“APFC meets every two years. New Zealand is chairing this session and will retain this role until the next meeting in 2015,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“It has been 50 years since the last session was last held in New Zealand, and the Government is privileged to host this event once again.

“Over the next four days delegates from 29 different countries will be exploring this year’s theme; how forests can contribute to the economic development and prosperity of countries,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Forestry is New Zealand’s third largest export. It provides $4.3 billion in annual exports.

“This Government is keen to help increase the value of our forestry exports, while being mindful that good stewardship of the environment is also critical,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“As a Government, we are prepared to look at new ways to help promote greater use of emerging and innovative technologies and systems to help this.

“International gatherings such as APFC help encourage conversations and collaborations. I will be watching the outcome of these sessions with a keen interest,” says Mrs Goodhew.
