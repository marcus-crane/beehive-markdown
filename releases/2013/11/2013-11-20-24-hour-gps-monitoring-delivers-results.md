Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says that communities are safer, and high-risk offenders are being held to account, following the introduction of 24-hour GPS monitoring.

Ankle bracelets are used to track the real-time movements of offenders, which send an alert if the criminal strays into an area which they have been excluded from, such as parks and schools, or from locations near victims.

146 offenders, many on parole or extended supervision orders for child sex offences or violent offending, have been subject to the monitoring since it was implemented in August 2012. The decision to impose the tracking is made by the Parole Board.

So far, 15 high-risk offenders have been identified in exclusion zones, 7 of whom are now back in prison, with the rest facing further sanctions or due to appear in court.

“This new technology allows Police and Corrections to act swiftly to keep the public safe,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Prior to the introduction of 24-hour GPS monitoring, we would not have known that these offenders were breaching their conditions, with the potential to harm the public.

“We have extended the tracking to low security Release-to-Work prisoners, to allow more of them to gain vital work experience outside the wire ahead of their release. 60 prisoners from the total of 146 have been on Release-to-Work.

“24-hour monitoring has also been extended to domestic violence offenders, to help protect their victims.

“The Parole Board has imposed monitoring on two such offenders so far, and Corrections is now looking for ways to increase these numbers by providing comprehensive family violence risk assessments to the Board.”

84 offenders are currently on 24-hour GPS monitoring, of which 18 are on Release-to-Work.
