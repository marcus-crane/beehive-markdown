Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams says public comments from some parliamentary parties that they will not be supporting legislation in regards to copper pricing is not unexpected.

“While we have not sought support for legislation from our support parties, they have indicated to me that legislation was always going to be a challenge, so today’s announcement comes as no surprise,” Ms Adams says.

“For some time the Government has been considering a number of possible non-legislative options.

“Since the Commerce Commission’s decision was announced the Government’s approach has been consistently that the first priority is for Chorus to meet the shortfall itself.

“If this is not possible the Government would look at other non-legislative options as a first choice. Nothing in today’s public comments from some parliamentary parties changes that.

“The Government’s primary concern is to ensure that New Zealanders get access to ultra-fast broadband, because that is what is in the long-term interests of New Zealand.

“In order to properly assess the range of options, the Government has commissioned independent advice about Chorus’ financial position and its capability to deliver on its contractual obligations with the Government.

“This report is about ensuring that the Government and the wider community have good information about whether Chorus’ financial position would seriously undermine and threaten New Zealanders’ ability to get ultra-fast broadband.

“Once the Government has received the independent report, it will then be able to look at next steps.

“The Government has always said that there are a number of options on the table so it is important that we have some factual information before further decisions are made.”
