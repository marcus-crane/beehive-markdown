Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will travel to Sydney tomorrow to address the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO) Women’s Conference.

The Conference is part of the GOPIO Biennial Convention and provides opportunity for women of Indian ethnicity to network and address current, critical issues confronting women of all ages globally.

“All women, including those of Indian descent, have played and will continue to play an important role in New Zealand’s story,” Ms Collins says.

“This conference is an excellent opportunity for women from the Asia-Pacific region to come together in solidarity to pave the way in their communities for the next generation to follow.”

Ms Collins will speak to the Conference about ‘Equitable Treatment of Women in Business and Profession’ from a New Zealand perspective.

“Our nation has a proud history of women achieving in so many sectors of society: in commerce, politics, in the legal world, in literature, science, arts and on the sports field,” Ms Collins says.

“However, there are still inequalities to address and challenges to overcome. And the challenges facing New Zealand – particularly around increasing the number of women in senior management and leadership positions – are echoed in nations around the world.”

More than 1000 people are expected to attend the weekend’s Convention from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Fiji.
