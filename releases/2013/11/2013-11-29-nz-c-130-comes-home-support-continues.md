Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman today praised the work of the Royal New Zealand Air Force in the Philippines as the C-130 Hercules stationed in Tacloban prepares to return to New Zealand.

“Typhoon Haiyan had a catastrophic impact on parts of the Philippines, leaving more than 5000 people dead and destroying more than one million homes,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand provided over $5 million to support immediate relief efforts and deliver much-needed supplies, however, there is still work to be done.

“We know from our own experience, and experience of disasters in the Pacific, that helping communities get back on their feet as soon as possible is vital. We will be talking with the Philippines Government and partners about how to best support recovery efforts.”

The New Zealand C-130 has been part of the global air bridge delivering relief supplies. It will return to New Zealand next week.

“The work of the New Zealand Defence Force in the Philippine’s has been nothing short of lifesaving,” Dr Coleman says.

“Our C-130 has delivered more than 270 tonnes of relief supplies and evacuated more than 1000 survivors since it started operations in Philippines on 16 November. New Zealanders can be very proud of the job our Air Force has done.

“Two New Zealand Defence personnel, who are on exchange with the British Armed Forces, will remain in the Philippines on board the HMS Illustrious to help with damage assessments and early recovery efforts.”
