Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced a series of Education Festivals to be held next year in March to complement the International Summit of the Teaching Profession in New Zealand.

“Celebrating excellence in education is an important part of the Government’s commitment to raising the status of the teaching profession, and publicly acknowledging the critical contribution the profession makes to lifting overall student achievement,” says Ms Parata.

“The series of education festivals will be held in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch around the time of the Summit. The three festivals will be themed around collaboration, innovation, and celebration, with each festival reflecting their community.

“The festivals will share best practice among educators, and bring the best in education to the wider community. There is so much excellent teaching and learning going on in New Zealand, and the festivals will be an opportunity to showcase this,” Ms Parata says.

“Hosting the international summit, holding the festivals, introducing the excellence awards, and establishing the new professional body EDUCANZ, are all part of acknowledging the profession, raising its status, and recognising the critical contribution that quality education achievement makes to the future prosperity of New Zealand.

“I earlier announced the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Award programme that will recognise and celebrate groups of New Zealand educators and parents partnering for a better education for our children and young people,” says Ms Parata.

Last week Ms Parata also announced a proposal to establish a new body EDUCANZ, to replace the New Zealand Teachers Council, which is the cornerstone of the Government’s commitment to strengthening the teaching profession.

“Teaching needs a strong professional body that provides leadership to, and is owned by the profession.

“The new body I have proposed will support system changes to improve the quality of teaching and education leadership and will have the needs of children and young people, along with the public interest, at its heart.

Earlier in the year Ms Parata also announced that New Zealand would host the International Summit - “the World Cup of education” - in March 2014, which is co-convened with the OECD and Education International, represented in New Zealand by the NZEI and PPTA. It is aimed at the top 25 education systems as measured by the OECD, and invites the Ministers of Education from each of those systems.

“The education sector has been very supportive and instrumental in the two announcements I have made today. They are as determined as the Government to ensure we share quality teaching practices as well as recognising and celebrating success in the education sector, and there is much to celebrate,” says Ms Parata.
