Prime Minister John Key today welcomed a number of new business signings between New Zealand and Thai companies that will enhance the commercial links between the two countries.

“There is huge scope for collaboration between companies in New Zealand and Thailand, and the signings I have witnessed today show the range of areas in which cooperation is possible,” Mr Key says.

“Last year New Zealand‘s exports to Thailand totalled more than NZ$626 million, with food and beverage products accounting for 73 per cent, or NZ$458 million, of that total.

“The Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement has opened up exciting new opportunities for both countries.  But, ultimately it is up to businesses in both countries to take advantage of those opportunities, and it’s encouraging to see that happening. 

“Today’s signings include the opening of new offices in Thailand, significant software and information systems delivery, food and beverage agreements and construction projects.

“Thailand was New Zealand’s 10th largest trading partner last year, and, further opportunities exist in the trade of commodities and value-added products and services,” Mr Key says.

Prime Minister Key is currently in Thailand leading a delegation made up of representatives from 22 New Zealand companies. The five announcements, made during a business luncheon in Bangkok included:

- Global logistics company Mainfreight, a New Zealand domiciled and NZX-listed company, has announced plans to open their first Thailand office for their Air & Ocean global network.
- New Zealand global security leader Gallagher has announced plans to expand their operations in Thailand to support growing needs of the ASEAN countries.
