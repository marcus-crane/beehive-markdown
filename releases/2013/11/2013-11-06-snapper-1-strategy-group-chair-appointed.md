Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the appointment of Sir Ian Barker to Chair the new Snapper 1 Strategy Group, which will work on a long term plan to manage the fishery.

“As part of the Snapper 1 review this year I directed the Ministry for Primary Industries to set up a multi-sector strategy group before the end of the year. There will be seven members appointed in total, with two members each representing the commercial, recreational, and customary sectors.

“A clear message from submitters was that people want to see a long-term strategic approach to managing what is New Zealand’s most valuable inshore fishery. We want to get everyone around the table, working together on protecting this fishery for future generations.

“The group’s primary task is to develop a management strategy for Snapper 1 by 1 October 2015 which will determine how best to maximise the benefits from this fishery for everyone.

“I want to see the stakeholders – the people with a direct interest in this fishery – working together. Finding common ground will help provide a solid foundation for decision-making into the future.

“I am pleased that Sir Ian Barker has been chosen to chair the group. He has had a distinguished legal career with a strong reputation as an arbitrator and mediator, is independent and widely respected.

“MPI have written to various organisations seeking nominations for these positions. I strongly encourage all sectors to engage with MPI to get the right people around the table. The intention is for the group to hold its first meeting before Christmas.

“The Snapper 1 stock is rebuilding but still needs to be carefully managed so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy the benefits. We need to start working on the strategy now,” says Mr Guy.
