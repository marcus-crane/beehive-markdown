Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce will travel to China tomorrow to highlight the New Zealand-China trade, science and education relationship.

The six-day visit will take in the cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beijing and Shenzhen.

“The New Zealand-China trade relationship has grown quickly in the last decade, reflecting both China’s increasing importance to the world economy and the benefits to New Zealand of the New Zealand-China Free Trade Agreement” Mr Joyce says.

“The trade relationship is well known, however the New Zealand-China education relationship is also on the rise.”

In Hangzhou, Mr Joyce will take part in education meetings, and raise New Zealand’s education, business and investment profile into an important second-tier city.

In Shanghai and Beijing, Mr Joyce will host senior Chinese officials, company representatives and media at a series of high profile events aimed at enhancing the New Zealand brand and raising awareness of New Zealand’s food and beverages, technology, education and investment opportunities.

Mr Joyce will also open the Shenzhen Hi-Tech Fair, China’s largest hi-tech event, where eight New Zealand companies will be exhibiting.

“Since the FTA came into force in September 2008, more than 90 per cent of tariffs have been reduced to zero, two-way trade has increased by 75 per cent, and New Zealand exports to China have more than tripled,” Mr Joyce says.

“In the year ending September 2013, total two-way trade between New Zealand and China was up 16.8 per cent to NZ$16.53 billion. Exports were up 28.5 per cent to a record high of $8.27 billion, and imports were up 7 per cent to NZ$8.26 billion.

“Education is now New Zealand’s third largest export to China after dairy and wood, with over 24,000 fee-paying Chinese students studying in New Zealand in 2012 (up 4.5% on the previous year). Students from China now account for 27 per cent of the international student population in New Zealand, and contributed NZ$800 million to the economy.

“This trip provides the opportunity to highlight our educational strengths and the contribution we make to educating students from China.”
