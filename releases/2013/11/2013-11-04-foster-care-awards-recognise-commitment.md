Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has presented awards to eleven foster families tonight at Government House in Wellington.

“These awards recognise the selfless commitment foster carers make to children in care who desperately need a stable home,” says Mrs Bennett.

“On behalf of all New Zealanders, I thank these outstanding foster parents for supporting these children, keeping them safe and giving them a better future.”

The Excellence in Fostercare Awards is a joint initiative between Fostering Kids and Child, Youth and Family, which is in its second year.

Minister Bennett says she’s proud to join Governor General Jerry Mateparae in presenting the awards to outstanding foster carers who’ve come from all over New Zealand to attend the ceremony at Government House.

There are around 3,400 foster carers in New Zealand, with about 4,000 children in care at any one time.

“It can be a tough job for those who pick up the pieces after a child has been so seriously abused or neglected they’ve been removed from their parents.”

Minister Bennett is leading work to improve support in this area.

“We’re working on a comprehensive Care Strategy to better support both foster carers and children who have been abused and neglected.”

“For example we can do better with more flexible financial support for carers; we can improve the way young people transition out of care and we will.”

Legislation currently before Select Committee proposes to extend support provided to young people in care, to ensure those who aren’t ready for independence, can be supported up to the age of 20.

“This is something young people who’ve experienced State care asked me to consider and having listened to their concerns, I’ve done something about it.
