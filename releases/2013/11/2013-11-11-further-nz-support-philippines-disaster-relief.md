Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced New Zealand will provide a further $2 million to support humanitarian relief efforts in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan.

"Typhoon Haiyan has caused significant damage and affected more than 4.4 million people across 36 provinces in the Philippines," Mr McCully says.

"Close to half a million people have had to leave their homes and sadly the death toll is rising.

"New Zealand will provide $750,000 in dollar for dollar funding to New Zealand non-government organisations that are working with partners on the ground to support the relief and initial recovery effort.

"We will also set aside a further $1.25 million in funding to be allocated over the coming days as the priority areas for support are identified,” Mr McCully says.

This funding is additional to the $150,000 that New Zealand has already committed to the International Federation for Red Cross to support the immediate distribution of relief supplies and conduct needs assessment.

In addition, an official from the New Zealand Aid Programme will be joining the specialist United Nations Disaster Assessment Coordination (UNDAC) team. The team will work with Philippines emergency management agencies and government to plan and coordinate international support. 

"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with the Government of the Philippines as they address this significant natural disaster," Mr McCully says.
