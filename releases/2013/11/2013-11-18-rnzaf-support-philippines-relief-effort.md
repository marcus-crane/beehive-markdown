A RNZAF Hercules C-130 which left New Zealand on Thursday has delivered key emergency aid equipment and food to the battered cities of Tacloban and Ormoc and the town of Guiuan.

The Hercules was the first C-130 to land at Ormoc since Typhoon Haiyan hit the region. Crew unloaded the cargo of World Food Programme stocks, and then 126 Filipino evacuees were transported to Cebu.

Around 30 tonnes of rice, tinned food, water, emergency shelters, field hospital equipment and toilets have been transported. 1,000 kitchen sets from New Zealand-funded pre-positioned supplies are to be distributed via the Philippines Red Cross and 1,285 tarpaulins have also been distributed. It has also evacuated a total of 237 survivors to Cebu.

Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman praised the assistance given by the Air Force in contributing to the international relief efforts.

“The reported number of people affected is over 10 million people, with 3.9 million displaced. It is important that New Zealand plays its part in the international relief efforts and I thank the RNZAF for its on-going service”

The C-130 arrived in Darwin last night to load the second (and final) consignment of 4 tonnes of relief supplies (water bottles, masks, tents and tarpaulins) donated from New Zealand before returning to Cebu. The C-130 will remain in the Philippines this week to provide assistance if requested by the Philippines Government.
