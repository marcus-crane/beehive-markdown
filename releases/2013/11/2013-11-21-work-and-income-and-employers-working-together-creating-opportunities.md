Work opportunities continue to open up for beneficiaries thanks to strong relationships between Work and Income and employers.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett was pleased to help open Countdown Lincoln Road in Henderson today, where 44 new jobs have been created – 14 filled by Work and Income clients.

“Work and Income have been incredibly active in the lead up to the new supermarket opening, establishing contact with Countdown and letting them know beneficiaries were ready and waiting to get hired,” Mrs Bennett said.

Interviews with Work and Income clients took place at the Waitakere Community Link, and the feedback from Countdown was overwhelmingly positive, especially regarding the quality of candidates.

“I was pleased to witness first-hand the great result that comes with this sort of partnership in Henderson today, and it’s going on all around the country,” says Mrs Bennett.

A new Kmart in Richmond opened this month with 39 beneficiaries gaining work thanks to a comprehensive recruitment plan prepared by Work and Income Nelson for Kmart.

“Over 50 beneficiaries have also gained employment at Mitre 10 Mega New Lynn, which I was pleased to help open last month,” Mrs Bennett said.

Work and Income’s hands-on approach is proving extremely successful, along with the work and training subsidies available for employers through the Job Streams package.

Job Streams allows Work and Income to adapt services for employers to meet their individual staffing needs, meaning the subsidy and training package is flexible and funding goes where it’s most effective.

The Work Bonus incentive payment is also making an impact, with over 1,100 beneficiaries receiving the payment since July.

“People who go off benefit and into work despite having no work obligations are eligible for the Work Bonus payment, which sees their benefit phased out rather than stopping immediately,” says Mrs Bennett.

Incentives like the Work Bonus payment, along with a work-focused approach to case management, and flexible options for employers through Job Streams are creating more options for Jobseekers, and seeing more people off benefit and into work.
