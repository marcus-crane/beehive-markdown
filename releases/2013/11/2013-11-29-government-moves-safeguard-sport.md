Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully today announced the formation of a senior officials’ inter-agency group and the implementation of a national match fixing policy to safeguard New Zealand sport.

The measures were recommended by a Sport NZ-led report into the implications of the Australian Crime Commission investigation linking organised crime and banned substances to some Australian sporting codes.

“The report found no evidence of widespread drug use or organised crime in New Zealand sport,” Mr McCully says.

“But it would be naive to think New Zealand is insulated from these problems. This is why we are taking pre-emptive steps to safeguard our athletes and clean sporting reputation.”

Key New Zealand sport sector, law enforcement and border control agencies will be mandated to share relevant information and resources with senior officials meeting every six months.

The national match fixing policy, to be implemented from 2014, will include the sport sector and betting industry. More details will be released in due course.

Factsheets outlining the New Zealand assessment and recommendations, inter-agency group and match fixing policy are available at: [www.sportnz.org.nz/](http://www.sportnz.org.nz/)

The full report will not be released as it contains sensitive information provided by the Australian Crime Commission.
