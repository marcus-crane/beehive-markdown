Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today received the Commerce Commission’s final Unbundled Bitstream Access price.

The Commerce Commission today announced a final Unbundled Bitstream Access (UBA) price of $10.92, an increase from the draft price of $8.93.

When added to the current UCLL price, this gives a combined wholesale copper price of $34.44. This compares to the current price of $44.98 and the entry level fibre price of $37.50 to $42.50.

“Now that the final UBA price is known, the Government will consider its options in detail before making any further decisions,” Ms Adams says.
