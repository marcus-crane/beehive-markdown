Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced a number of changes to the Board of Public Trust. 

Current Member Fiona Oliver will be elevated to the vacant Deputy Chair position, having served on the Board since 2009. 

“Ms Oliver’s funds management and financial services experience has proved of great value during her tenure, and I believe she will provide strong support for the Chair,” Ms Collins says.

Diana Puketapu, an Auckland-based chartered accountant and director, and David Tapsell, a commercial lawyer based in Wellington will also join the Board, filling current vacant positions. 

Ms Collins say Ms Puketapu and Mr Tapsell bring strength and skill to the Board as well as offering fresh perspectives on Public Trust’s business and customer base.

Another Board Member, Auckland chartered accountant Dinu Harry, will be reappointed for a second term.
