Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed today’s Supreme Court decision to dismiss an appeal by Save Kapiti to the granting of consents for a stretch of the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance.

“This means construction is set to begin within weeks on the long-awaited State Highway 1 MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway.”

Mr Brownlee says he understands that the NZ Transport Agency is on track to begin construction later this month.

"The MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway is now an absolute certainty, and this is cause for Wellingtonians to celebrate.

“By building a four lane divided expressway linking the capital to the north, we will save lives, reduce journey times, and provide a huge boost to the economic growth and productivity of the region,” Mr Brownlee says.

"I am satisfied that the decision by the Board of Inquiry to grant consents was a sound one based on a fair and rigorous process.

“We're now ready to get spades in the ground and see this extremely important highway corridor take shape.

"And it won't be long before we'll be building Transmission Gully, which is due to kick off in the middle of next year.

"The expressway is a critical component of the Wellington Northern Corridor, which will provide the secure, safe and efficient artery that our capital city needs.

“Once fully completed it will reduce peak journey times by a massive 40 minutes, prevent deaths and serious injuries, provide a more resilient lifeline in the event of a natural disaster, and directly promote economic growth.

“It will also improve this important corridor’s vehicle emissions profile, which I know the Greens hate hearing, but it’s true,” Mr Brownlee says.

The decision means that both the MacKays to Peka Peka section of the Kapiti Expressway and Transmission Gully are fully consented.

“So a planned 2017 completion date for the MacKays to Peka Peka section is still on the cards,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Residents of greater Wellington will soon be reaping the benefits of a much improved roading network.”
