ACC Minister Judith Collins is pleased to announce the appointment of Professor Gregor Coster to the ACC Board.

“Professor Coster’s extensive experience in the health sector will complement the wide mix of skills already present in the ACC Board,” says Ms Collins.

“In particular, Professor Coster will bring to the ACC Board synergies with WorkSafe New Zealand. Professor Coster has also been appointed Chair of WorkSafe, forging a strong connection between the two organisations as they work towards the Government’s 2020 target of reducing workplace fatalities and serious injuries by 25 per cent.”

Ms Collins says ACC has a commitment to injury prevention that is both effective and cost efficient.

“Professor Coster’s appointment will ensure that ACC and WorkSafe draw on each other’s strengths so that their efforts make the most difference to the safety of workers.”

Professor Coster’s previous governance roles include chairing the West Coast District Health Board and the Royal NZ College of General Practitioners, and a term as Deputy Chair of Pharmac. He will continue his roles as Deputy Chair of Health Workforce New Zealand and a member of the UNICEF Board. Professor Coster will be concluding his term as Chair of the Counties Manukau District Health Board shortly.

Professor Coster’s has had a lengthy period in general medical practice and at the University of Auckland, where he was Dean of Graduate Studies. He has also served on a number of specialist advisory groups, trusts and review teams in the health sector.
