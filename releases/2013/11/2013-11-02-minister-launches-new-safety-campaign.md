Environment Minister Amy Adams has today launched a campaign aimed at reducing the number of New Zealanders dying from exposure to hazardous substances at work.

The three-year multi-media campaign is designed to awaken New Zealanders to the fact that taking hazardous substances for granted can have deadly consequences.

Confronting images of weaponry, such as pistols, assault weapons and hand grenades, alongside ordinary solvent guns and other common industrial products such as paint, aim to drive home the message that hazardous substances are dangerous and should be treated with the same respect as a loaded weapon.

“New Zealanders' attitude toward health and safety at many small businesses is too casual and it is literally killing us,” Ms Adams says.

“This campaign will deliver a stern message that casual attitudes toward health and safety are not acceptable."

About 150,000 workplaces throughout New Zealand use hazardous substances.

A survey by the Environmental Protection Authority shows that only 25 per cent of New Zealand businesses comply with key safety rules for handling and storing hazardous substances.

An estimated 500-800 New Zealanders die from occupational illness every year. Many of these deaths are caused by long-term exposure to hazardous substances at work.

"We are talking about a figure that is higher than New Zealand's annual road toll, which shows why action is needed.

"Most of these deaths are largely preventable with the right combination of education, enforcement and greater investment by industry in modernising safety systems.”
