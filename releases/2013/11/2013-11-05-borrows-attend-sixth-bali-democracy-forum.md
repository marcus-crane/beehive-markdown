Courts Minister Chester Borrows will this week represent New Zealand at the Sixth Bali Democracy Forum, hosted by the Government of Indonesia.

The Forum will bring together Heads of State and ministers from 28 countries from around the world to discuss ways to strengthen democratic institutions across the region.

“New Zealand has a strong democratic history that is more than just a set of laws, but an integral part of our Kiwi culture,” says Mr Borrows.

“The Forum gives us the chance to share our experiences with our neighbours, and to reflect on our own democratic institutions.”

The Bali Democracy Forum was established in 2008, and New Zealand has attended annually since then at Ministerial level. It is this year being held in Nusa Dua, Bali, and includes discussions on consolidating democracy in pluralistic societies, conducting free and fair elections, and building and strengthening democratic institutions.

“The Forum is an important opportunity to reinforce ties with our neighbours.

“With some of the world’s largest and fastest growing economies represented at the Forum, there’s also a valuable opportunity to engage with our regional trading partners.”

Mr Borrows will be in Indonesia from 6 to 9 November.
