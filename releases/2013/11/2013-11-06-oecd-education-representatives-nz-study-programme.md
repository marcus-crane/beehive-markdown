Representatives from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are currently in New Zealand to study Learning and Change Networks (LCN) as part of their Innovative Learning Environment study.

Education Minister Hekia Parata was at Rata Street School today with David Instance, Director of the OECD’s Innovative Learning Environment section and Tony Mackay, OECD’s Consultant Advisor as part of their study.

“New Zealand is one of only five countries out of 26 selected to be involved in this study. Through the research the OECD is doing, our LCN programme will be held up internationally as an example of best practice,” says Ms Parata.

The OECD Innovative Learning Environment study is looking at innovative environments that can stimulate educational change. They will be visiting LCNs around the country from November 4-8.

“We’re at Rata Street School today, because I am proud to say, it is part of New Zealand’s growing LCN community, which focuses on different ways of working for students, their families, schools and communities to accelerate achievement among learner groups.”

There are 380 New Zealand schools involved in 52 Learning and Change Networks currently operating nationwide. The networks connect with each other to increase their knowledge and understanding of what works for students that they have not previously been successful with.

“The networks challenge themselves to think and work differently to help a student achieve. They find out what needs to change, develop a plan and then implement it with input from the student.”

“The LCN and innovative learning is likely to be discussed as part of the International Summit on the Teaching Profession being held in New Zealand next year in March, which I am jointly convening with the OCED and Education International,” says Ms Parata.
