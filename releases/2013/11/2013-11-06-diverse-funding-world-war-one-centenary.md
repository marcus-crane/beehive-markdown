Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced 30 projects commemorating the centenary of the First World War have been granted $2.7 million in funding by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board.

“World War One had a considerable impact on New Zealand’s character, identity and sense of place in the world. The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board recognises the importance of this centenary event to our nation and has set aside over $17 million to fund community initiatives and projects,” Minister Tremain said.

“The community projects that have received funding show a diverse range of approaches to the commemorations, which I think demonstrates the wide significance of the war to New Zealanders.

“For example Hamilton City Council is establishing a memorial garden commemorating military personnel who have died in overseas conflicts. Other projects to receive funding include the Tauranga Historic Society for a public lecture series, the Hampden Presbyterian Church for an exhibition and play, the Tui Trust Board for a publication on a member of the Māori Pioneer Battalion and the Cantando Choir to commission and perform a choral work.

“Last year’s decision to expand the eligibility criteria has enabled a wider range of projects to secure funding,” says Mr Tremain.

“For example a Nelson drama group, the Rugby Museum Society and Messines in Belgium  (where a pivotal battle for the New Zealand Division took place) have all received funding.”

Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson welcomed the decisions, saying increased attendances at Anzac Day services show a growing interest and understanding amongst New Zealanders of the sacrifices made in all armed conflicts.

“The lottery funding will enhance commemorations for everyone regardless of where they live in New Zealand. The First World War centenary commemorations will be significant and will take place over several years. Projects funded through the lottery grants will sit alongside a wide range of activities and events, including those being organised through the official centenary commemoration programme.”

Mr Finlayson last year established the First World War Centenary Panel to steer an extensive programme to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War. The Panel provided advice and assistance to the Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee on its decisions.

The Committee also awarded one grant of $3.6m to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa from the "projects of national significance" pool for a multi-media exhibition.

The full list of decisions from the first and second round are available as PDFs. Further information can also be found at  [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz)

**Background**

A decision was made by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board in mid-2012 to expand the then Lottery Grants Board Environment and Heritage Committee to become the Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee.

The decision meant that funding was made available to support community events, activities and capital projects associated with commemorating the centenary of the First World War.

The board set aside $10 million for projects of national significance and $7.2 million for community projects and events.  The final funding round is now open and closes on 20 November 2013.  Applications to this round will be considered in April 2014. All applicants to the fund must show they have a community purpose and can provide a benefit to New Zealand.

The First World War Centenary Panel was established by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage in July 2012 as an advisory group to help steer what will be an extensive programme to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War. There is more information about the programme on the website [WW100.govt.nz](http://ww100.govt.nz).
