Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced that a review of harm minimisation systems for Class 4 gambling in pubs and clubs will be carried out by the Department of Internal Affairs.

The review follows the passing of the Gambling (Gambling Harm Reduction) Amendment Bill 2013 and was signalled in September after the new provisions came into force.

“The Government is committed to reducing harm caused by gambling. The review will look at the benefits and costs of introducing pre-commitment systems as well as other types of harm minimisation technology,” says Mr Tremain.

“It is important to make sure we have the most accurate information, before we consider the introduction of any further harm minimisation technology into gaming machines. I have asked officials to look at international research and trials so we know where the evidence sits.”

The review will involve talking to experts in the field and will examine:

- the feasibility, costs and benefits of introducing pre-commitment systems (and associated technology)
- other types of a harm minimisation systems, for example, player-tracking systems, and
- the effectiveness of the current regulations

“The review addresses one of my priorities, which is to enhance protections for problem gamblers in pubs and clubs. I have also made a commitment to the Māori party to consider the introduction of harm minimisation technology and fairer regional distribution as well as ways to reduce the number of pokie machines in low socio-economic areas.” says Mr Tremain.

“Officials will report back to me early next year on possible enhancements to the current harm minimisation initiatives, including ideas for what may be effective and feasible.”
