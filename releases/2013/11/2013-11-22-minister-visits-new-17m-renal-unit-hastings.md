Health Minister Tony Ryall today visited Hawke’s Bay’s new $1.7 million dialysis unit which is giving more patients access to this life sustaining treatment.

Mr Ryall said the upgraded facilities at Ballantyne House now have 20 state-of-the-art dialysis stations – an increase of seven stations in the Hawke’s Bay.

“We face an increasing demand for dialysis services in New Zealand. This new unit will ensure Hawke’s Bay people continue to receive treatment even as demand grows.

“All outpatient dialysis services are now consolidated into the one modern unit on the Hawke’s Bay Hospital site. By bringing these services together it means patients are now getting more one-on-one time with nurses.

“The facilities are more spacious and comfortable for patients. New electronically operated dialysis chairs have also been installed. These chairs considerably increase patient comfort and help to relieve tension during treatment.

“Ballantyne House is another example of this government’s investment in dialysis services.

“Part of the government’s long-term strategy is to provide better treatment services for dialysis, but it is important to note this plan is matched by an equally strong focus on prevention,” says Mr Ryall. 

This is one of seven dialysis units that have opened in the past five years.
