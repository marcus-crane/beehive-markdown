Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today opened the new track to one of New Zealand's highest waterfalls as part of commemorations to mark 125 years of the Milford Track in the Fiordland National Park.

"This 1.4 kilometres of new track through some of the most spectacular and rugged terrain in New Zealand opens up access to the awe-inspiring Sutherland Falls. The cascading 580-metre waterfall is one of New Zealand's natural wonders and is an integral part of the Milford Great Walk experience," Dr Smith says.

"The track was closed more than a year ago due to a large rockfall triggered by heavy rainfall. The new $390,000 track includes two new 40-metre suspension bridges across the upper Arthur River.

“This season also marks 125 years of tourism on the 53-kilometre Milford Track since the route between Lake Te Anau and Milford Sound was pioneered by Quintin Mackinnon for the Otago Survey Department in 1888.

"In 1908 the Milford Track was coined 'the finest walk in the world' and today Milford remains one of the most popular of DOC's nine Great Walks.”

The track sees as many as 17,500 people experience Milford each year. More than 6,000 of these are independent walkers, who stay in well-equipped DOC huts. About a third of these are New Zealanders and two-thirds international visitors.

Tourism on the Milford Track is estimated to be worth up to $35 million to the New Zealand economy each year, with the lion's share (about $20 million) benefitting the southern lakes region.

"My message to every New Zealander is to put the Milford Great Walk on their must-do list. There is no better walk anywhere in the world and it has just got better with the new Sutherland Falls track," Dr Smith says.
