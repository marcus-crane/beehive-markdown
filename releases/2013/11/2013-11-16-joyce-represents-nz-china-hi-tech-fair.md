Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today gave the keynote speech at the opening of the China Hi-Tech Fair in Shenzhen – the leading technology show in China.

Eight New Zealand companies are exhibiting at the Fair, which is China’s largest and most important hi-tech event and is jointly hosted by 10 Chinese Government ministries including the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Science and Technology.

“This event has been presenting the latest scientific, technological and economic developments for the past 15 years and will be a very important platform for further promoting communication, cooperation and development of science and the economy between China and New Zealand,” Minister Joyce says.

“Only the best products and services will open doors in China, so I’m delighted to support some of New Zealand’s brightest and best companies at this Fair, which is a platform for them to exchange information and experiences, and to make new connections. These companies are experts in fields like energy saving, environmental protection, and health IT for which there is a huge appetite in China.”

The companies exhibiting at the Fair are: PowerByProxi; Wellington Drive Technologies; Fusion Transactive; Ewaters Environmental Science and Technology; Boffa Miskell; Fisher and Paykel Healthcare; Polsol International; and NZ Natural Harvest. As well as exhibiting at the Forum, the companies will also attend various other events and meetings as part of a New Zealand Trade and Enterprise-led visit.

“Our first and second highest exports globally are dairy and tourism, and New Zealand is well known in China for our dramatic landscapes and our agricultural and food production expertise – sectors which are performing well, thanks to our growing trade relationship with China,” Mr Joyce says.

“Less well known is that New Zealand’s technology industry is growing rapidly and approaching NZ$10 billion in annual GDP. Our ICT, high tech, and medium high tech industries together already contribute nearly nine per cent of New Zealand's exports of goods and services, approaching half that of dairy on 20 per cent.

“New Zealand’s economic future lies with businesses that are prepared to innovate to be competitive - clever companies that have the products and skills to look outward. However, our companies can struggle to achieve the scale to bring products to a market as big as China, so this Forum will show that New Zealand is a source of world-leading and rapid technological innovation.

“Similarly, our companies need to know more about China. Chinese technology corporate giants are hungry for new innovations to license or commercialise. So there is a perfect match between New Zealand’s resourcefulness and ingenuity and China’s commercial and financial muscle.

“Our job as the Government is to help facilitate this entrepreneurial endeavour. The New Zealand Business Growth Agenda is all about helping Kiwi companies succeed on the world stage. China is a technology force with a hunger for cutting-edge innovation. New Zealand can be an ideal partner, particularly in niches where we have clear technological advantages.”
