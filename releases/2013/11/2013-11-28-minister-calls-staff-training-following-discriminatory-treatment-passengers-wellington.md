The Minister for Disability Issues, Tariana Turia has reiterated her call for all public transport companies to review their policies and provide staff training immediately following further reports of incidents of discriminatory treatment of disabled people and those with pushchairs.

“I was very alarmed at news reports that disabled passengers and those with children and pushchairs are experiencing discrimination while trying to board buses in the Hutt Valley and Wellington,” says Minister Turia.

“People with children and those who live with disability have a right to access transport services around the country. Accessing transport is crucial for everyone including those with disabilities. It’s a basic requirement to enable people to get to school, to work, and to participate in the community.”

“People with disabilities often tell me it is not their disability that is the problem, but rather it is the way the disabilities are viewed by others. Bus companies must change the way they perceive those with disabilities. I urge public transport operators around the country to make sure their services are truly inclusive of all people.”

“Bus companies need to monitor driver behaviour to ensure that every bus user is treated respectfully.”
