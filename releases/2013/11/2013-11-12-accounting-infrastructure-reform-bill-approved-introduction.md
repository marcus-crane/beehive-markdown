Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced the government will introduce changes that will enable the accounting and audit industry to be more agile in an increasingly competitive environment.

“The Accounting Infrastructure Reform Bill is part of the government’s Business Growth Agenda to improve regulation and promote healthy financial reporting frameworks.

“The accounting and audit industry will be better supported to meet a broader range of business and community needs,” says Mr Foss.

The Bill proposes a number of important changes to enable the industry to be more efficient and effective, including:

- widening the scope for qualified members of accredited professional accounting bodies to perform statutory audits
- updating legislative references to ‘chartered accountant’ with references to a ‘qualified statutory accountant’
- allowing New Zealand audit firms to incorporate as a company if desired, keeping in line with international practice. It will also allow incorporated overseas  audit firms to perform statutory audits in New Zealand
- improving the quality of financial reporting of charities by requiring all registered charities with an annual operating expenditure of $500,000 or more to have their financial statements reviewed by a qualified auditor.

“Members of NZICA and ICAA recently voted in favour of the proposal to create a trans-Tasman voice for chartered accountants. This Bill will enable them to put that proposal into action and will also recognise that New Zealand members of accredited bodies like CPA Australia are well qualified to perform accounting and audit functions,” says Mr Foss.
