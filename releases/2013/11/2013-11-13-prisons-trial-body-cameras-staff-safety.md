Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says that officers in two prisons are to wear on-body cameras, in a six-month pilot programme aimed at further increasing staff safety.

Auckland and Rimutaka prison staff working in maximum and high security areas, and prison drug dog handlers, will wear the cameras to de-escalate incidents, deter assaults on staff and to gather evidence for use in court and complaints processes.

Footage will also be used to improve staff training and for debriefs following any incidents.

The camera trial, due to begin in January, was endorsed by the expert advisory panel, chaired by former Police Commissioner Howard Broad, which was set up to review and support the implementation of the Department’s Staff Safety Action Plan.

“Frontline prison staff are better resourced than ever before to deal with difficult situations, but we remain focused on improving safety,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These new, deliberately visible cameras will ensure that recordings of incidents can be used to hold offenders to account. Prisoners will be aware of the technology, and this should act as a deterrent in some potentially violent situations.

“Corrections will also be able to use the recordings to provide best-practice training in dealing with difficult incidents, and will assess the trial after six months before making further decisions.

“The safety of our prison staff is paramount, and I want to thank them for their efforts.

“Since 2009 the Government has introduced tactical exit training for 4000 frontline prison staff, implemented training and access to pepper spray for use as a tactical option, and delivered batons, spit-hoods and stab-resistant vests for staff working in high-risk situations.

“We will continue to assess prison safety, to ensure that everything is being done to make staff as safe as possible, in what can often be volatile and dangerous environments.”
