Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the Customs and Excise Act 1996 will be reviewed.

“The current Act is restrictive and constant changes in the border environment mean that legislative amendments continually have to be made to authorise Customs’ use of new technology and operating methods at the border.

“The review is an opportunity to develop a flexible legislative framework that can adapt to changes at the border and technology, and allows minor changes to be made by regulation rather than legislative amendments

“It will also provide a clear statement of Customs’ roles and purpose,” Mr Williamson says.

A discussion paper for public consultation will be developed next year.
