Justice Minister Judith Collins says Andrew Little’s claim that the Government introduced the Harmful Digital Communications Bill in response to recent allegations of sexual predatory behaviour is wrong.

“In May 2012 I asked the Law Commission to fast-track its recommendations for reducing the harm caused by cyber bullying as part of its broader review of media regulation.

“In August 2012 this Government welcomed the Commission’s report on new media outlining recommendations to address cyber bullying.

“In April 2013 I outlined our proposals to hold cyber bullies to account for their bullying and harmful online behaviour.

“Addressing the growing incidence of cyber bullying and its devastating effects, particularly for young people, has been a key priority of mine as Minister of Justice.

“I’m pleased the work and commitment of this National-led Government to reducing the harm caused by cyber bullies has culminated in the introduction of the Harmful Digital Communications Bill.

“To suggest I introduced this Bill in response to yesterday’s allegations of sexual predatory behaviour is wrong.

“Understandably when one has not been in Government, one may not understand the process involved in introducing a Bill – it does not happen overnight.

“One should also note that alternative trial processes will not alter the fact that victims still need to come forward to make complaints and ultimately give evidence against an accused person.

“There are very serious concerns about how inquisitorial trial processes would work in conjunction with adversarial trials for related offences such as kidnapping.”
