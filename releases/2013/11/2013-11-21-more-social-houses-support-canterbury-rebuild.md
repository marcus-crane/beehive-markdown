Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today turned the sod to mark the beginning of construction for Housing New Zealand’s new 26 inner city apartments and opened a further six community social housing units in Saint Albans.

“There’s no simple solution to solving Christchurch’s complex housing challenges. It requires we take action on a range of fronts to counter the loss of so many homes to the earthquakes and the increased demand for social housing,” Dr Smith says.

Housing New Zealand’s 399 Manchester Street development will see the construction of 26 one and two bedroom apartments in two buildings. Of these 11 will be kept by Housing New Zealand and the remainder sold on the private market.

“This $3.3 million development is part of Housing New Zealand’s commitment to build 700 new homes and repair a further 5,000 by the end of 2015,” Dr Smith says.

“This well-designed, energy efficient housing development is a great example of what we are able to do in Christchurch as part of our commitment to the earthquake recovery. The site includes communal areas for vegetable gardens, BBQ facilities, and roof solar panels.”

The housing development is expected to be completed by November 2014.

The Minister also opened the first six of 45 housing units the Government has provided $4.1 million for social housing provider Comcare Trust to build.

“Comcare provides an important community social housing service for vulnerable single people, most of whom have experienced mental illness or addictions. Post-earthquakes their service is more in demand than ever,” Dr Smith says.

“These new community social housing developments are further steps on the long road to rebuilding Christchurch’s housing stock. They complement Housing New Zealand’s $1.6 billion Canterbury rebuild programme. The Government has also established four temporary accommodation villages, partnered with the private sector to provide worker accommodation, provided housing assistance through the Christchurch Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service, intervened to help resolve Christchurch City Council’s consenting issues, and is developing a Land Use Recovery Plan to allow for significant new greenfield and brownfield housing developments.”
