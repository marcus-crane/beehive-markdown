The latest labour market data shows that South Island unemployment continues to be considerably lower than the North Island, with the South Island regions helping lead New Zealand out of the GFC, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“While the regional unemployment data does move around quite a lot from quarter to quarter and should be treated with a degree of caution, it’s great to see regions like Otago and Canterbury with unemployment rates with a four in front of them,” Mr Joyce says.

This week’s Household Labour Force Survey for the September 2013 quarter shows the overall unemployment rate for the South Island is 4.4 per cent – down from 5.1 per cent a year ago. The North Island unemployment rate is 6.8 per cent, while the national average is 6.2 per cent.

The unemployment rate for Canterbury was 4.2 per cent (down from 5.2 per cent a year ago), the rate for Otago was 4.8 per cent (down from 5 per cent a year ago and 6.3 per cent last quarter), and the rate for Southland was 5.4 per cent.

The rate for the combined regions of Tasman, Nelson – Marlborough and the West Coast was 3.9 per cent, the lowest regional unemployment rate in the country.

There was a 4,300 increase in employment in Otago in the last quarter alone, with the participation rate also growing to 69.8 per cent – higher than the national average. There has been a 7,000 increase in employment in Otago in the last year.

“While the unemployment rate nationally is still higher than we would like, it has declined from 7.2 per cent a year ago, and the overall trend is of an improving labour market as the economy picks up. The Government is working across a number of fronts to help bring the rate down further,” Mr Joyce says.

”Canterbury employment continues to surge ahead, with the number of filled jobs rising 7.3 per cent for the September 2013 year, led by the construction and manufacturing industries.”

The economy grew at around 2.5 per cent in the year to June 2013, one of the highest rates in the OECD.

“Momentum in the New Zealand economy is continuing to grow, with September’s trade data confirming the recovery from last summer’s drought is underway, along with the highest increase in permanent and long-term migration in over a decade,” Mr Joyce says.

Business confidence rose to 14 year highs in September’s Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion and in October’s ANZ Business Outlook. The recent Grant Thornton International Business Report puts New Zealand sixth out of 44 economies in terms of business confidence.

“The Government’s comprehensive Business Growth Agenda is all about creating the conditions for businesses to invest for jobs and growth, and helping regions to take advantage of the opportunities available to them. It includes around 350 initiatives to create a more productive and competitive economy to create more jobs and higher wages for kiwis around the country,” Mr Joyce says.
