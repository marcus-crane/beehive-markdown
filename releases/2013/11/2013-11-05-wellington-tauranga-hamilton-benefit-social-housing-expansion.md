Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced a further $3.5 million of funding for community social housing provider Accessible Properties to build 20 more homes in Wellington, Tauranga and Hamilton.

Dr Smith made the announcement while opening Accessible Properties latest development in Wainuiomata. The $1.2 million development has previously received $480,000 of funding from the Government’s $139 million Social Housing Fund.

“These four new community social houses in Wainuiomata will provide good quality low-cost housing for tenants with disabilities and low-income families in need,” Dr Smith says.

“The new funding will allow Accessible Properties to build a further 12 homes in Wellington and four each in Tauranga and Hamilton. Accessible Properties has been a major recipient of funding in this round of grants from the Social Housing Unit. In total it has received $8.9 million of funding, with financial support also granted for the building of 13 units in Auckland and 16 in Christchurch.

“The Government is keen to grow the community social housing sector as we recognise their ability to provide a good quality, low-cost housing service, as well as providing access to comprehensive support services for their tenants.

“The Social Housing Reform Bill, expected to be passed into law by Christmas, will also help to kick-start growth in the sector. The real game changer will allow community social housing providers to access the income related rent subsidy for new tenants. This is significant as up until now only Housing New Zealand has been able to access the subsidy.

“The Government is focused on growing the community social housing sector to support families in need, as well as addressing the root causes of housing affordability. We are taking action on a range of fronts including freeing up land supply, reforming the RMA, reigning in council development charges, keeping interest rates lower for longer, scrutinising building material costs, investing in skills and productivity, and supporting first home buyers through changes to Welcome Home Loans and the KiwiSaver First Home Deposit Subsidy.”
