Prime Minister John Key met with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra late last night New Zealand time for talks focused on promoting trade and economic links between Thailand and New Zealand.

“My visit to Thailand follows Prime Minister Yingluck’s to New Zealand earlier this year. These high level meetings are extremely valuable, and we are committed to finding further opportunities to grow the relationship,” Mr Key says.

Thailand is New Zealand’s 10th largest trading partner and the two countries cooperate on a range of issues including education, science and innovation, and regional security.

“There is huge potential for New Zealand and Thailand to expand our economic cooperation and we have a strong foundation for this through our Closer Economic Partnership,” says Mr Key.

“During our meeting last night we agreed to take a fresh look at this agreement. Our trade with Thailand has doubled since our CEP was signed in 2005. We want to ensure it continues to deliver for the private sector and provides the best possible platform for future growth.

“A number of New Zealand businesses have interests in Thailand. I was able to update Prime Minister Yingluck on the business initiatives signed during my visit.

“As our two countries are world leaders in global tourism we agreed to look at how we can learn from each other’s experience in this sector and how we can increase the frequency of direct flights, and the number of visitors between both countries.

“I was pleased to join with Prime Minister Yingluck, following our bilateral meeting, to witness the signing of an arrangement on tourism cooperation, as well as two education signings between individual New Zealand universities and Thai education authorities.

“We also cooperate across the range of regional forums, including the EAS and APEC, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with Thailand through the United Nations system as well,” Mr Key says.

Mr Key is currently in Thailand leading a delegation made up of representatives from 22 New Zealand companies.
