A bill to grow the community social housing sector and focus the Government’s housing support on high needs tenants passed its second reading in Parliament today 63 votes to 56.

“The Social Housing Reform Bill will help kick-start growth in the community social housing sector by giving approved providers access to the income- related rent subsidy for new tenants. This is a major shift as up until now these significant rent subsidies have only been available to Housing New Zealand tenants,” Dr Smith says.

“The Government is keen to grow New Zealand’s small community social housing sector as we recognise their ability to stretch the taxpayer dollar further, provide wrap-around services to clients, and transition people to independence.

“Our social housing reforms will also see the housing needs assessment transferred in April 2014 from Housing New Zealand to the Ministry of Social Development. This will make the needs assessment independent of housing providers and enable a more holistic view to be taken of people’s housing needs alongside other social and income support.

“The bill also extends reviewable tenancies to all Housing New Zealand tenants and focuses on those paying market rents and no longer requiring social housing. Reviewable tenancies will be undertaken with common sense and care. To ensure this, the bill includes a provision to enable Ministers to identify groups of people, such as vulnerable elderly or disabled tenants, who will not be subject to tenancy reviews.

“Labour bases its opposition to reviewable tenancies on the idea that it can solve the waiting list problem for high need families by just building more state houses. This is financially reckless and unrealistic. The Government needs the tools to ensure publicly-owned homes are focused on those with the highest need.

“This legislation builds on the Government’s work to grow the community social housing sector through start-up grants from the $139 million Social Housing Fund and Housing New Zealand’s record $2.9 billion three-year investment focusing on new builds, housing extensions, insulation, earthquake repairs, and maintenance.

“The Social Housing Reform Bill marks a significant shift from a policy of state housing to a more diverse social housing sector. My ambition is to have this new law passed by Christmas,” Dr Smith says.
