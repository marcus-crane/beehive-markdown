Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the reports on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Periods 16 and 17 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 16, which was paid on the morning of 30 October, paid 88,766 people a total of $173.6 million.

The report shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.084 per cent of staff across the country, 11 staff were notified as not paid, 34 were overpaid, and 26 underpaid. Affected staff were from 58 schools or 2.36 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 17, which was paid on the morning of 13 November, paid 89,955 people a total of $176.18 million.

Complaints and notifications, in regards to that pay period, were received regarding 0.093 per cent of staff across the country, 18 staff were notified as not paid, 37 were overpaid, and 29 underpaid. Affected staff were from 68 schools or 2.77 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“Pay Period 17 was the 17th of the last 18 pay rounds below the 0.5 per cent steady state error level identified by the Technical Review team,” Mr Joyce says.

“What is pleasing is that Pay Periods 16 and 17 had the lowest number of complaints and notifications received since we began monitoring the performance of pay periods in February.

“The challenge will be to maintain the steady performance as we head into the complex end of year /start of year process.”
