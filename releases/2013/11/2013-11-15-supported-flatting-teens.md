Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has been leading a project to set up supported flatting arrangements for teenagers.

“There are teenagers living away from home for a variety of reasons.Many face real challenges and lack the support they need to thrive,” says Mrs Bennett.

Teenagers can be at-risk living independently without good support and safe, appropriate accommodation.

“I’ve been investigating options to provide supported flats that allow teens to live independently, but in a safe place and with support close by.”

There are around 3,000 teens and teen parents on benefit, who under new rules must be in education or training or work-based learning as well as undertaking budgeting and/or parenting courses.

“We pay their bills like rent or board direct already and this could be directed to a supported flat situation, which could help pay for a live-in mentor.”

It makes sense to link housing and youth employment to eliminate the chaos that teenagers sometimes experience living independently without help.

“Youth service providers are doing a great job of supporting young people on benefit, including helping them manage accommodation costs and issues.”

“Some providers would welcome a supported flatting option for their youth to ensure they’re living safely in a supportive learning environment.”

Minister Bennett has asked her non-government organisation (NGO) Advisory Group to lead development of a flexible model for supported flats.

The NGO Advisory Group is working with NGOs and has established potential sites for flats and organisations able to host them.

“The Group has advised me there are some providers who are very willing to do this and youth workers see this as part of their ‘mission’.”

“We’re currently looking at a range of options and not taking a cookie-cutter approach means it could look different across the country to suit need.”

Currently, there are around eight potential sites around the country including in Christchurch, Tokoroa, Whakatane, Auckland, Hamilton and Invercargill.
