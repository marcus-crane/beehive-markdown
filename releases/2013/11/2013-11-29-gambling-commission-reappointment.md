Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced the reappointment of Lisa Hansen to the Gambling Commission. The new term, Ms Hansen’s second as a Commissioner, is for three years.

“The reappointment will retain valuable governance experience and skills. Ms Hansen, a Wellington barrister, will continue to provide her expertise and help maintain the high level of legal knowledge on the Commission,” says Mr Tremain.

The Gambling Commission is an independent statutory decision-making body. The Commission hears casino licensing applications, and appeals on licensing and enforcement decisions made by the Secretary of Internal Affairs in relation to gaming machines and other non-casino gambling activities.

The other Commissioners are Graeme Reeves of Wellington, Russell Bell of Whanganui and Abigail Foote of Christchurch.
