Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman is today visiting Exercise Southern Katipo in Timaru.

“Exercise Southern Katipo is a significant exercise for the NZDF,” says Dr Coleman. “It is the largest ever international exercise held in New Zealand with up to 2,200 military personnel taking part, including personnel from Australia, Canada, France, Malaysia, PNG, Singapore, Tonga, UK and US.”

“The exercise is an important opportunity for New Zealand to further engage with our international partners and test our interoperability. Exercises like Southern Katipo help New Zealand to prepare for a variety of contingencies, and ensure that we can play our part alongside other nations to provide assistance when required, particularly in the South Pacific.”

Exercise Southern Katipo aims to test the NZDF’s ability to mount a medium scale amphibious operation involving maritime, land and air assets. It also tests the current capability of the NZDF’s Joint Task Force, a key outcome of the 2010 White Paper.

“The NZDF is making good progress towards having the Joint Task Force at the core of its structure by 2015,” says Dr Coleman. “This joined-up capability, drawn from Navy, Army and Air Force, as well other government agencies, will be a key capability for New Zealand and a valuable asset contributing to regional security.”

HMNZS Canterbury and HMNZS Wellington, and up to 9 RNZAF aircraft are taking part in the exercise, including the new NH90s and A109s which are participating in a major exercise for the first time.

“The Government has made a significant investment in new Air Force state-of-the-art capability, and it is great to see that new capability being utilised with the NH90s and A109s taking part in their first major exercise,” says Dr Coleman.

Personnel from NZ Customs Service, Immigration NZ, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministry for Primary Industries, NZ Police, and NZ Transport Agency are also supporting the exercise.

France has deployed the frigate FS Prairial and two aircraft. Australia and Singapore have each deployed a C-130J, and the US has deployed two C-17’s.
