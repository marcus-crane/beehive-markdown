State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest statistics on core government administration positions show the public service continues to remain within the cap set by the Government in March 2012.

“As of 30 June 2013, there are 36,474 full-time equivalent positions in core government administration,” says Dr Coleman.

“In combination with a focus on departmental baselines and Better Public Service Programme results, the cap on core government administration positions remains a useful part of the overall performance story across the public service.

“The Government is making good progress in our 10 Better Public Services Results areas, and the latest *Kiwis Count* survey shows satisfaction and trust in our public service continues to rise.”

Also released today, the *2013* *Human Resource Capability Survey* gives an updated picture of the composition and trends across the public service workforce.
