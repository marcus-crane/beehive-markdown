Minister of Internal Affairs Chris Tremain today announced that TSB Bank has become the first bank to go live with the RealMe service to enable new customers to prove their identity.

“I congratulate TSB Bank for being the first bank to adopt this innovative new product. RealMe is a core component of the Governments drive to deliver online services.  It is good to see the private sector adopting the technology to help drive their business,” says Mr Tremain.

“From today, people with a RealMe verified account can join TSB Bank using RealMe on their \[my]bank iPhone app (with Android to follow shortly). There’s no need to supply identity documents during the sign up process to prove who you are. You can do it all from the mobile app with the RealMe service.

“Law changes last year enabled private companies to use RealMe. The banking sector is leading the way in becoming early adopters.  Kiwibank has also confirmed they will use RealMe for their online banking services, and other banks such as Westpac have given very strong commitments.

“Banks can use RealMe to meet the requirements for electronic identity verification set out under the new  Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism legislation.

“RealMe enables proof of identity online to a high degree of confidence. It is the online equivalent of walking up to a counter and showing your driver licence or passport. It also enables people to login to multiple government services securely with a single username and password.

“RealMe is another example of better public services making life easier for New Zealanders. It will be a reality that Kiwis can apply for their first passport and enrol to vote, all while staying in their living room, and using the same username and password each time they prove their identity. I look forward to more businesses signing up to RealMe in the near future.”

**Background:**

RealMe leverages the strengths of the two organisations behind it - the Department of Internal Affairs and New Zealand Post.

- **New Zealand Post** has more than 170 years’ experience in managing and co-ordinating huge amounts of information - and their primary role in RealMe will be through the PostShop network serving as the place in the community where people can have a biometric photograph taken which ties their actual identity to their RealMe username and password and bring documentation if required.

<!--THE END-->

- **The Department of Internal Affairs** will take that information, check it and verify that the person is who they say they are – a complex task, but one which is similar in many ways to the role the Department of Internal Affairs has played for so many years when processing passport applications.
