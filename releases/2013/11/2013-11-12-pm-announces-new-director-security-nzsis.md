Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Rebecca Kitteridge to the position of Director of Security, New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS).

Ms Kitteridge will replace Dr Warren Tucker, who is retiring next year.

“Ms Kitteridge is a highly respected and professional public servant with experience in senior roles,” Mr Key says.

“She is currently Secretary of the Cabinet and Clerk of the Executive Council at the Department of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet (DPMC), and has served under four Prime Ministers and four Governors-General while at DPMC.

“Ms Kitteridge was also seconded to conduct a high profile compliance review of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) late last year.

“She will bring strong leadership skills, excellent relationship management skills and a highly collaborative approach to the role of Director of Security.

“Ms Kitteridge’s strong focus on improving systems and processes, while ensuring safeguards are in place, will also be an asset in the role,” Mr Key says.

The Director of Security is responsible directly to the Prime Minister as the Minister Responsible for the NZSIS.

Ms Kitteridge’s compliance review of the GCSB looked at whether the Bureau’s activities were undertaken within its powers and with appropriate safeguards in place.

In her current role as Cabinet Secretary she has direct responsibility for the Cabinet Office and oversight of the DPMC staff at Government House.

Previous to her DPMC roles, Ms Kitteridge spent four years in the Legal Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, four years as Crown Counsel on secondment to the Cabinet Office, and nine years as a private sector lawyer at Chapman Tripp and other law firms.

Ms Kitteridge is expected to commence as Director of Security when Dr Tucker’s term as Director comes to an end on 30 April 2014.
