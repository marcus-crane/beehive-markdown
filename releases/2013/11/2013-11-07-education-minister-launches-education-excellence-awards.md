Education Minister Hekia Parata today launched the inaugural Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards which aim to recognise and celebrate excellence in teaching, leadership, community engagement and governance.

“Our education system is top performing for most of our young people, and that is a credit to our teaching profession, and to the parents, families, and communities that support our schools. These Awards will recognise and celebrate those successes.

“As well, we know that there are those who are falling behind, and we want to spotlight the school and community partnerships that are meeting that challenge and making a significant difference,” says Ms Parata.

“We know that quality teaching and strong leadership are crucial to raising student achievement at school. We also know that strong parent connections, and high community expectations make the difference outside of our schools.

“These Awards aim to acknowledge those people and practices who are delivering a better education to our children and young people, and help raise the bar for the profession by identifying and showcasing quality teaching.”

The Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards will focus on early childhood education, primary and secondary schooling and collaboration amongst secondary schools, tertiary providers, and employers to create pathways for young people.

These Awards are distinctive in their focus on collaboration, and collective effort, and are only open to partnerships and groups.

The four main categories are:

- Excellence in governing – providing vision, innovation and creativity to inspire teaching and learning that lifts achievement.
- Excellence in leading – leading peers or colleagues to challenge and lift achievement.
- Excellence in teaching and learning – lifting achievement, engagement, retention and attendance of young New Zealanders.
- Excellence in engaging – working with parents and communities to transform relationships and involvement.

The winning entry of each category will receive $20,000 and professional development opportunities. Category winners will be eligible for the Prime Minister’s Supreme Award, which will be awarded to the partnership or group that has had the most impact on raising student achievement. Winners of the Supreme Award will receive an additional $30,000.

A further prize will be awarded each year focusing on a different part of the education system.  The 2014 Education Focus Prize will be awarded to a group that has demonstrated collaboration between secondary schools, tertiary providers, and employers to meet young people’s needs.

Entries for the Awards are now open and close on 31 March 2014.  Information and entry forms are available at [www.pmawards.education.govt.nz](http://www.pmawards.education.govt.nz)

The finalists will be announced in April 2014 and a national Awards ceremony will be held in June.
