Registrations are now open for New Zealand’s first Muslim World Forum and Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins is encouraging Kiwis of all ethnicities to take part.

“The Forum provides a fantastic opportunity for New Zealanders who are interested to connect, explore contemporary issues and celebrate New Zealand’s diversity,” Ms Collins says.

“Participants will have the chance to discuss challenges the Muslim community may face and find solutions to support Muslim Kiwis to be active and engaged members of New Zealand society.”

The Forum is part of the Office of Ethnic Affairs’ Building Bridges Programme and is organised alongside the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand. It is sponsored by members of the Muslim Community.

Topics such as ‘New Zealand’s Transnational Links with the Muslim World’ and the ‘Triumphs and Tribulations of the New Zealand Muslim’ will be discussed.

“All New Zealanders benefit from the strength and innovation diversity brings to our businesses, workplaces and communities. This Forum provides opportunity to further embrace and enhance the benefits of New Zealand’s diversity.”

Ms Collins looks forward to addressing the Forum on 23 November in Auckland.

More information and registration for the event is available at ethnicaffairs.govt.nz.
