Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of a New Zealand Story Group who will be responsible for promoting and protecting the ‘New Zealand Story’.

The Group comprises an advisory board, an operational management team within New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, and New Zealand Way Limited, who administer the Fern Mark.

The advisory board will be led by a private sector chair, who has still to be appointed, and will include the Chief Executives of NZTE, Tourism NZ, Education NZ, Te Puni Kokiri, MFAT, and the Ministry for Primary Industries; along with three private sector representatives. 

Those private sector representatives are:

**Steve Smith** is shareholder and co-founder of Craggy Range Vineyards. He is also the Wine and Viticulture Director for Craggy Range. In 1996 he became a Master of Wine, the only viticulturist in the world to have this distinction. Steve is a passionate crusader of New Zealand wines, with a strong commercial, exporting and marketing background.

**Julie Christie** is the founder and former CEO of Eyeworks New Zealand and Australia, formerly known as Touchdown Productions.  The company’s formats have been licensed to 30 countries including the US, UK, France and Germany.  Julie is a director for the Australian Drug Detection Agency and also owns Sky’s Living and Food channels and two restaurants. She is also a member of the NZTE board.

**Karl Wixon** is President of the Designers Institute of New Zealand and one of the founders of Nga Aho, New Zealand's Society of Maori Design Professionals. Of Ngai Tahu descent, Karl has been involved in development of the NZ Story project and has been active in Maori economic development strategy and brand projects. He has a sound understanding of how our unique New Zealand culture can materialise into value in offshore markets.

“It’s important that we have strong private sector experience in the Creative and Primary Sectors, as well as Maori representation. We are satisfied that these appointments will provide an appropriate mix of skills and experience,” Mr Joyce says.
