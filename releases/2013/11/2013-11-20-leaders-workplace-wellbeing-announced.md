ACC Minister Judith Collins congratulates the winners of this year’s Workplace Wellbeing Awards and says they are leading a positive culture change in workplaces across New Zealand.

“It was a privilege to present the New Zealand Workplace Wellbeing Awards last night in recognition of employers’ dedication to promoting and improving workplace wellbeing,” Ms Collins says.

“I congratulate award winners Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, Sanitarium, Auckland Museum, Canterbury District Health Board and Sancta Maria College, for their fantastic efforts and achievements.

“There is a growing acceptance that workplace wellbeing should be seen as a strategic investment producing better outcomes and organisational success. It’s fantastic to see these organisations are leading by example.

“New Zealanders are extremely resourceful and dynamic and we must use this to make wellbeing and safety an important part of our workplace culture.”

The New Zealand Workplace Wellbeing Awards are run by the Heart Foundation and the Health and Productivity Institute of NZ (HAPINZ). The ceremony was part of the Wellington Workplace Health and Wellness Forum attended by Health and Safety Managers, Occupational Health Nurses, Human Resources Managers, and Business Managers from a wide range of sectors.
