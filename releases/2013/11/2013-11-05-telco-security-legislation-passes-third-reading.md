A Bill that will safeguard public safety and security has passed its third reading in parliament today, Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams says.

Ms Adams says the Telecommunications (Interception Capability and Security) Bill will ensure the legislation remains effective in a rapidly-changing telecommunications environment.

There are two parts to the Bill. The first part relates to obligations for telecommunications companies, and is focused on modernising the existing interception capability regime.

“New Zealanders are changing the way they use telecommunications.  This is increasingly online; talking, texting and sending emails rather than calling on home phone lines.

“Not only is the technology faster, smarter and globally reaching, but our industry has fragmented and we have seen a proliferation of new entrants in the market.

“It is therefore critical that our legislation keeps pace with these changes and allows surveillance agencies the ability to help keep New Zealanders safe.”

The second aspect of the Bill puts in place a formal network security framework to help keep New Zealanders safe from unwelcome intrusions on our telecommunications networks, where these intrusions affect our national security.

“Many of our critical infrastructure providers, including our electricity, gas and finance providers, are reliant on our telecommunications networks. 

“Our increasing reliance on telecommunications networks means that we are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and it increases the potential scale of loss and damage they may cause.

“Network operators are facing new and ever increasing threats that are advanced, persistent and sophisticated.

“In this area, the GCSB has access to specialised information about potential vulnerabilities and threats.

“Network operators do not have access to this level of information, which can make it difficult to make informed decisions about the design, build and operation of their network.”

Until now, New Zealand has not had a formal scheme in place to effectively manage and address potential national security risks associated with our public telecommunications networks.

“This Bill will formalise and build on existing partnerships to ensure that all network operators engage with government, and give certainty and clarity to network operators about when, how and on what to approach government.

“Updating the legislation will ensure New Zealand’s telecommunications companies have a clearer understanding of how to meet their obligations while ensuring their network infrastructure does not pose a risk to New Zealand’s national security, as we move to an increasingly online world.”
