Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has opened a new photo exhibition at Parliament which showcases women in the construction industry.

“Women are embracing diverse career paths and making a successful contribution in this traditionally male dominated workforce,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The exhibition creates a photographic montage of 24 women in many construction disciplines.

“The 2006 census found 16 per cent of the construction workforce was women. Enrolment figures for engineering, building and trade training in 2012 suggests this figure could soon be much higher.

“Our aim is to inspire women already working in the industry to higher success, and to encourage women to consider construction as a career choice,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The exhibition is being presented by the National Association of Women in Construction, NAWIC.
