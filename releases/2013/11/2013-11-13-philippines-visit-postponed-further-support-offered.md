Prime Minister John Key announced today that New Zealand is sending an RNZAF Hercules to contribute to relief efforts in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan.

The Prime Minister also announced the postponement of his visit to the Philippines.

“A visit next week would place undue pressure on the Philippines Government at a critical time of the relief and recovery phase.

“New Zealand knows from recent experience in Christchurch how demanding responding to a large-scale disaster is and we don’t wish to distract from these efforts.

“An RNZAF C-130 Hercules carrying emergency supplies will depart New Zealand tomorrow for the Philippines. The aircraft will remain in the area for at least 4 – 5 days to provide transport support to relief efforts as required,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand  will also launch a $2.3 million initiative with the Philippines Red Cross to bolster disaster relief supplies for future events.

“The Philippines, like New Zealand, is extremely vulnerable to natural disaster. Pre-positioning supplies at various locations around the country will mean that relief items can get to affected communities without delay,” says Mr Key.

“This initiative is in addition to the $2.15 million already announced as New Zealand’s response to Typhoon Haiyan.   We are continuing to monitor the situation closely, and will work with the Philippines Government to meet any further requests for assistance,” says Mr Key.

The C-130 will depart for the Philippines in the next couple of days.

The Prime Minister departs tomorrow for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka and an official visit to Thailand.
