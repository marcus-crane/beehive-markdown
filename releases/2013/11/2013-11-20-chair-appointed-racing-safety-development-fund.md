Racing Minister Nathan Guy today announced the appointment of Penny Mudford as Chair of the New Zealand Racing Safety Development Fund (RSDF).

“Penny has over 10 years’ experience in a range of governance roles both in the public and private sectors. She has strong mediation skills which will stand her in good stead in her role as chairperson,” says Mr Guy.

“The RSDF is a contestable fund of $1 million per annum, matching dollar-for-dollar contributions from racing clubs. The aim is to support projects that improve safety in the racing industry by upgrading facilities for jockeys, harness riders, the racing animals and patrons.”

Since the fund was created six years ago it has provided $6.64 million to projects to improve safety and upgrade facilities in the racing industry.

“Some of these projects include horse containment fencing, construction of swabbing boxes, replacements to running rails, track upgrades, improved horse starting gates, mobile starting barriers, greyhound safety fencing padding and harness racing night lighting.

“Improving the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators and officials is an important priority for the industry. This fund is there to support these efforts.

“I want to thank outgoing Chair Bruce Martin who has done an excellent job over the last six years.”

The racing industry makes an important contribution to the New Zealand economy, generating around $1.6 billion annually and around 17000 jobs.

There are around 150 active racing clubs and nearly 70 racecourses around the country.
