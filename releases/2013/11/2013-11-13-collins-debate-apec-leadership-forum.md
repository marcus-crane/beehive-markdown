Judith Collins will attend the APEC Women’s Leadership Forum in China this week – *‘Championing innovation through inclusive leadership’.*

The Forum, hosted by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, brings leaders in politics, business and civil society together to discuss current challenges and opportunities facing professional women.

“It’s an honour to be invited to this year’s APEC Women Leaders Forum,” Ms Collins says.

“The Forum is an excellent opportunity for women leaders throughout Asia Pacific to come together to discuss how we can capitalise on business opportunities in our region.

“It’s also provides opportunity for women leaders to explore the contribution they can make in their own nations such as achieving greater economic independence and securing more women in senior management and leadership positions.”

As part of the Forum, Ms Collins will take part in a debate alongside Chandran Nair, Founder & CEO, Global Institute For Tomorrow, Hong Kong.

Ms Collins and Mr Nair will negate the moot ‘Breakthrough Innovation is Driven by Aggressive Leaders’. Speaking for the motion are Vice-President of IBM research Dr Josephine Cheng and Chinese businessman Mr James Li.

Around 300 women leaders from the Asia Pacific region are expected to attend the Forum, including New Zealanders Dame Jenny Shipley and Dame Wendy Pye.
