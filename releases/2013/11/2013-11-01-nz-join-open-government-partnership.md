State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman has confirmed at the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Summit in London that New Zealand will join the OGP initiative which promotes open and transparent government.

“New Zealand has a strong tradition of open and transparent government, and we celebrated one hundred years of our professional, politically neutral public service this year,” says Dr Coleman.

“In joining the Open Government Partnership, New Zealand is showing we are committed to promoting open and transparent government, and we look forward to sharing best practices and expertise with our overseas partners.

“The government has established a number of initiatives which deliver more open and accountable government to New Zealanders. The Better Public Services programme shows how the government is tracking on its commitment to delivering better public services. Through the Kiwis Count survey, the government publishes up to date information on the quality of service New Zealanders are receiving from public services.”

New Zealand plans to develop an OGP Action Plan that builds on the government’s existing efforts to improve public services.

The OGP Summit is taking place in London from 31 October - 1 November 2013. The OGP is a multilateral initiative committing governments to promoting transparent and open government through empowering citizens, fighting corruption and harnessing new technologies. Since the OGP was established in 2011, it has grown from eight to 60 participating countries.
