Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced Massey Primary in Auckland is the first to connect to the Network for Learning (N4L) managed network.

“Today we are celebrating a significant day for New Zealand schools, as Massey Primary is the first to take advantage of the $211 million that this Government is investing in the managed network,’’ Ms Parata says.

“Through the managed network, the Government is picking up the cost to provide schools with safe, predictable and fast internet with uncapped data, content filtering and network security services.

“It will also provide greater accessibility to a growing collection of teaching and learning resources.

“We expect Massey Primary to be quickly followed by connections to Mt Aspiring College in Wanaka and Waimate High School in South Canterbury, meaning schools at both ends of the country will very soon have access to funded, high quality, fast internet and uncapped data to enhance learning.

“In addition, N4L is announcing today the next 100 schools to be connected by the end of term one, 2014,’’ Ms Parata says.

“It is exciting to be connecting the first school slightly ahead of schedule and to be releasing the list of the next 100 schools,” Ms Kaye says.

“I understand from N4L that the connection Massey Primary is now receiving through the Government funded fibre and network is about 10 times faster than what the school was previously using,” Ms Kaye says. “The Principal has told me both the speed and the fact that the Government is paying for this uncapped connection will make a significant difference to Massey Primary School.

“The first school being switched on to the managed network marks the realisation of a significant investment by the Government over five years. This amounts to $700 million for digital infrastructure including laying down fibre, the School Network Upgrade Project (SNUP) and the managed network, meaning schools are able to improve learning with the best possible 21st Century technology.

“I anticipate we will be able to announce the next tranche of schools early next year as N4L is committed to connecting 700 schools by the end of 2014,” Ms Kaye says.

“Technology, and digital learning, are part of our modernising of the education system to raise achievement for all our children and young people,” Ms Parata says.
