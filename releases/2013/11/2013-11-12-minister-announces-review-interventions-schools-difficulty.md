Education Minister Hekia Parata says she has asked the Secretary of Education, Peter Hughes, to review the way interventions are managed in schools in difficulty.

“I have asked the Secretary to review how we help schools in difficulty move back into full self-governance.

“This has been an area of discussion for us and it is timely to see if we can improve this function, as we constantly strive to provide system support to our schools,” said Ms Parata.

Currently, there are interventions in place at 72 of the nearly 2600 schools across the country. Commissioners, who take on all the powers of a board of trustees, have been appointed at 26 schools, and Limited Statutory Managers, who take on some of a board’s functions, are in place at 46 schools.

Officials met with the New Zealand Principals’ Federation today and there have also been concerns raised by NZEI, New Zealand Schools Trustees Association and the PPTA.

“My officials tell me there is a great deal of common ground around the issues and that a working party across key sector groups could very usefully guide the review.

“I am aware that sector groups have important insights on how the Ministry can best help schools and boards of trustees’ transition through times of difficulty and back to full self-governance again. Terms of Reference and a timeline for the working party will be worked through over the next couple of weeks.

“I have already taken other steps to strengthen school governance including significantly increasing funding to NZSTA in Budget 2013, strengthening their authority and working with them to build their capacity.” says Ms Parata.

“This Government is committed to raising education achievement for five out of five of our kids and to keep them all safe. Intervention is only taken if issues have arisen that the school’s Board of Trustees are not able to manage, or if there are serious risks to the operation of the school and the welfare or educational performance of its students,” says Ms Parata.

“It is a proportionate response, as the numbers indicate, but all are in agreement that improvements can be made.”
