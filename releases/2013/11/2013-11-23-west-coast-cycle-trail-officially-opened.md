Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain today officially opened the West Coast Wilderness Trail in Kūmara.

The 136 km West Coast Wilderness cycling trial travels from Greymouth in the north, thorough Kūmara and Hokitika and then to Ross in the south.

“The local community have totally got behind the construction of this trail.  It’s a joint effort between the Government and local councils and offers exciting opportunities for tourism on the West Coast,” says Mr Tremain. 

“As part of a new funding package the Government will in partnership with Development West Coast make available $2 million dollars to support the completion of the final section of the trail from Hokitika to Ross and the West Coast Miners Memorial events centre in Greymouth. 

“Cycling the West Coast Wilderness trail is like taking a historic step back in time.  The trail uses tracks carved out by pioneering gold miners. Riders travel through a diverse landscape of rainforest, glacial rivers and lakes, wetlands and snow-capped mountains. The other great thing is that it’s an easy ride suitable for cyclists of all ages and abilities. 

“Ngā Haerenga, The New Zealand Cycle Trail offers huge economic benefits for tourism. The challenge now is for local businesses to identify opportunities associated with the trails and help deliver a memorable and truly world class cycling experience.”
