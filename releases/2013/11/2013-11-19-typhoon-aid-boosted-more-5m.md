Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide a further $2.975 million to help those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, taking New Zealand’s total contribution to more than $5m.

“More than 10 million people have been affected by Typhoon Haiyan, with an estimated 4 million displaced and in need of emergency food and shelter. The death toll is reportedly close to 4000,” Mr McCully says.

“This assistance package includes direct funding for much needed emergency supplies, such as food, water containers, tarpaulins, generators, kitchen sets and chainsaws.

“Further funding is being provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross and World Food Programme to help purchase and distribute emergency supplies.

"The package also includes a further $750,000 (total $1.5m) in dollar for dollar funding for New Zealand non-government organisations working on the ground."

Mr McCully says the additional funding is above the airlift and logistical support being provided by the New Zealand Defence Force C-130 operating in the Philippines.

Over the weekend the plane delivered about 30 tonnes of rice, tinned food, water, emergency shelter, field hospital equipment and toilets to the battered cities of Tacloban and Ormoc and the town of Guiuan. It also evacuated a large number of survivors to Cebu.

New Zealand’s financial contribution in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan now totals $5.125m.
