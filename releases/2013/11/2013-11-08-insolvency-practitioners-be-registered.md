A bill that will require insolvency practitioners to be registered and meet minimum requirements has passed its second reading in Parliament, Commerce Minister Craig Foss announced.

“The Insolvency Practitioners Bill is aimed at improving the integrity of our financial system and investor confidence in our markets by ensuring that all corporate insolvencies are carried out professionally and efficiently and with the skills required for the job,” Mr Foss says.

Under the Bill all insolvency practitioners will be required to be registered and the Registrar of Companies will have enhanced oversight and enforcement mechanisms including the power to deregister practitioners who do not meet key requirements.

Other key provisions include:

- A public register held by the Companies Office will have basic and standardised information about registered practitioners
- Creditors must be provided with relevant information by insolvency practitioners at the earliest opportunity, including a statement of interests by the insolvency practitioner
- New eligibility criteria, enhanced duties, criteria for disqualification and a range of penalties for failure to comply with statutory obligations.

“I will also be introducing a Supplementary Order Paper that proposes further amendments to the Bill to better align requirements for the different types of practitioners, and clarify the obligations of practitioners,” says Mr Foss.

The Bill is set to come into force nine months after it is passed and Insolvency practitioners have up to three months after this to register.
