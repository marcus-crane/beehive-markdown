Associate Health Minister Todd McClay has extended his congratulations to the New Zealand Formulary team ahead of today’s launch of the New Zealand Formulary for Children.

The Children’s Formulary website was officially launched today by Children’s Commissioner Dr Russell Wills at the 65th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Paediatric Society of New Zealand in Dunedin.

“Children are some of the most vulnerable in society and this government has maintained a strong focus on providing them with the best opportunities. I am delighted that through this development, the treatment and care of New Zealand children will continue to be enhanced through safe, consistent practice and quality improvement,” says Mr McClay.

The New Zealand Formulary for Children website (and its forerunner website – the New Zealand Formulary) has been developed by a specialist pharmacist and IT team at the NZ Medicines Formulary organisation based in Dunedin, under a 10 year contract with the Ministry of Health.

The formulary websites provide (at the touch of a button) independently validated medicines information and guidance to doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other health professionals. This enables healthcare professionals to select safe and effective medicines for individual patients.

Over the last 16 months, the New Zealand Formulary website ([www.nzf.org.nz](http://www.nzf.org.nz)) has been visited by primary and secondary clinicians from general practices and hospitals through to pharmacy and health science students over 500,000 times - at an average of over 1000 clinical users each day.

 “Congratulations to Professor Murray Tilyard, CEO of the NZ Medicines Formulary and his team for the outstanding work they have done. I strongly recommend all health professionals who are working with children visit the site [www.nzfchildren.org.nz](http://www.nzfchildren.org.nz)” said Mr McClay

As with the New Zealand Formulary, the New Zealand Formulary for Children is a dynamic document and will be updated monthly. Feedback is encouraged form all health professionals in order to continually develop this important resource.
