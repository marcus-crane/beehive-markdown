Health Minister Tony Ryall has welcomed the 377 new graduate doctors who have accepted positions in public hospitals across the country.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said these junior doctors work under supervision and gain broad experience during their placement.

“I really wish these new junior doctors well for this next stage of their medical education,” says Mr Ryall.

“Despite the fact doctor retention is at an all-time high, every New Zealand citizen and permanent resident who graduated from one of our medical schools was offered a position.

“While some junior doctors haven’t been offered positions at their preferred location, graduates have been placed in hospitals across the country.

“I’m particularly pleased our provincial hospitals have been able to welcome so many new junior doctors. This augurs well for the future senior staffing of these hospitals,” says Mr Ryall.

North Island hospitals in which junior doctors have accepted work are: Whangarei (10), North Shore and Waitakere (42), Auckland City (42), Middlemore (42), Waikato (22), Tauranga (17), Whakatane (5), Rotorua (12), Gisborne (9), New Plymouth (12), Wanganui (4), Palmerston North (14), Hawkes Bay (18), Wellington, Kenepuru, Hutt and Masterton (43).

South Island hospitals are: Nelson (9), Wairau (4), Christchurch (42), Timaru (7), Dunedin and Wakari (17), Invercargill (6).

This government is committed to delivering the highest quality care to New Zealand families. Over 7,200 permanently employed doctors work in our public hospitals – 1,300 more than five years ago.
