New Zealand and China today took the next step in advancing the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) relationship between both countries.

Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, Steven Joyce, and China’s Vice Minister of Education, Du Zhanyuan, together unveiled a plaque establishing a “Virtual Technical and Vocational Education & Training Research Centre”, to be based at China’s Central Institute for Vocational and Technical Education (CIVTE), in Beijing.

Mr Joyce says the establishment of the centre is a further step in the development of the “New Zealand – China Vocational Education and Training Model Programme” first announced during the Prime Ministerial visit to China in April.

“When Minister Yuan Guiren and I launched the Model Programme in April, we did so in recognition of the fact that up-skilling a workforce is one of the most important challenges in developing a competitive economy.

“For economic development, a more highly skilled workforce is essential for higher productivity, competitiveness and profitability.  Better skills contribute to sustained employment, career progression, and the sustainable development of an economy and society as a whole,” Mr Joyce says.

“I’m delighted that we have today established the Virtual Research Centre, which builds on other developments since April, such as the Wintec-coordinated Symposium held in Qingdao in September.

“China is very focused on ensuring it has a skilled and innovative workforce to take it into the future.  Alongside this, you have New Zealand and its global reputation for excelling in applied and vocational teaching and training. It is an area where both our countries’ strengths and interests combine in a mutually beneficial way.”

The Virtual Research Centre will be managed by CIVTE (an agency under China’s Ministry of Education) and Education New Zealand (ENZ).  It will facilitate the transfer of technical and vocational education and training knowledge and foster the establishment of further research links in this area between New Zealand and China.
