Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will host Diwali celebrations at Parliament tonight and says the event is one of many examples of New Zealand embracing Indian culture.

“It’s a privilege to be hosting this evening’s Diwali celebration for our Indian community. It’s especially significant that the event will be held at Parliament, New Zealand’s decision making centre,” says Ms Collins.

“Diwali, the Indian festival of lights, is a time for us to come together with our families and communities, reflect on our journeys and celebrate our successes.

“It’s also an opportunity for New Zealand’s Indian community celebrate their heritage and showcase their culture’s fantastic colour, energy and stories.

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with India built on solid and longstanding people-to-people links and we have fourth or fifth generation Kiwis who trace their origins to India.

“New Zealand is one of the most diverse nations in the OECD. Indian Kiwis are valued members of our nation, making a tremendous contribution at all levels and to a variety of sectors in our society.

“I encourage all New Zealanders to embrace opportunities like Diwali to participate in, enjoy and understand other cultures and traditions”.
