Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced changes will be made to pool safety laws to save more lives.

“Amendments to the Fencing of Swimming Pools Act 1987 are expected to prevent a further six children drowning in home swimming pools every 10 years.  It will build on the success of the 1987 Act, which reduced the number of drownings in home pools from about 100 every decade to about 30 now.

“Changes will also remove inconsistent and cumbersome rules.  This will be a relief for pool owners who have long been frustrated trying to satisfy the absolute letter of the law as opposed to focusing on the intent of trying to save lives,” Mr Williamson says.

The changes to the Act will:

- provide clearer requirements for restricting access to swimming pools
- require councils to inspect swimming pools at least every five years
- provide that child-resistant spa pools adequately restrict access
- require pool retailers to inform buyers of their safety obligations
- exempt portable pools shallower than 300mm
- exempt garden ponds and stormwater detention ponds.

“These changes strike a balance between child safety and compliance costs,” Mr Williamson says.

During the consultation period the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment received 392 submissions from safety groups, pool industry, councils and pool owners.  The majority of proposals received more than 80 per cent support from submitters.
