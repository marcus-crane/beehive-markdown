Claims the Government has not heeded advice to expand the protection for Maui’s dolphin are false and overlook the Government’s proposed extension announced in September, Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“The Government imposed interim additional protections last year out to two nautical miles after a dolphin was killed in a set net off Taranaki. DOC subsequently expressed concern this did not go far enough. I have since announced the proposal for a 350 square kilometre extension from two to seven nautical miles in the Taranaki area where there have been Maui dolphin sightings,” Dr Smith says.

“Ms Dyson is just making a fool of herself. Either she does not know the Government has announced a proposed extension of the set net ban or she is deliberately misleading the public by not acknowledging it in her release.

“If she was genuinely concerned about the Maui’s dolphin she would be supporting the additional protections the Government is proposing.”

46,000 submissions were received last month on the proposed additional protections for the Maui’s dolphin.

“I am carefully working through these submissions and intend to finalise a decision on the set net ban and the comprehensive Threat Management Plan for Maui’s dolphin by the end of month,” Dr Smith says.

“The Government recognises that Maui’s dolphin are critically endangered and we are committed to doing everything practically possible to ensure their survival.”
