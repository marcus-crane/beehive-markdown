The World of Wearable Art (WOW) event will receive $900,000 from the Government’s $10 million Major Events Fund to help raise its international profile and grow to the next level, Minister for Economic Development Steven Joyce announced today.

“The WOW spectacle offers a world-class experience that enhances New Zealand’s creative image, offers a different kind of experience for tourists and expands the NZ brand,” Mr Joyce says.

“The exhibition will now also be going on tour internationally for the next three years. It will engage a lot more with the international market and encourage people to visit New Zealand for the awards.”

The $900,000 investment from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Major Events Development Fund covers a three year period until 2016.

It will support three key initiatives:

- Three international touring exhibitions, to be staged at museums in Asia, Europe and North America;
- An international education programme, including opportunities for international design students to participate in the event and a focus on attracting international students to study in New Zealand; and
- Opportunities for international business representatives to be hosted, both at the main event in Wellington and at the touring exhibitions.

“It is important the WOW brand is championed by New Zealand and develops as part of our nation’s intellectual property,” Mr Joyce says. “We need to stake our claim to the concept internationally and dissuade others from fulfilling any perceived void in the international market place.

“As New Zealanders, we are a pioneering, open and collaborative nation. This plays to our character, our strengths and the way we are viewed internationally.”

Wellington City Council estimate the event generates $15 million of new spend in Wellington annually. In 2013, WOW was attended by over 47,000 people.
