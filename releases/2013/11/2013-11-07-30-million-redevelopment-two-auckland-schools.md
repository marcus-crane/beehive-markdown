Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced major property redevelopments for Freemans Bay School and Southern Cross Campus in Auckland.

“We know that great teaching and learning goes on in our schools, but having modern learning environments just makes the whole process of raising achievement for all our young people that much easier,” says Ms Parata.

“In September we announced an eight-point plan to transform the way school property is delivered, to better support 21st Century learning environments and improved outcomes for all children,” says Ms Kaye.

“I am delighted that these two schools are the first of the $300 million commitment over a six-year programme,” says Ms Parata.

“Detailed cost estimates are still to be finalised but I am pleased to confirm the $30 million is being committed to support major developments at these two schools.”

“The planned six year programme targets around 30 schools that require major developments.  The Ministry of Education has selected these as the first two major development schools using a range of criteria including condition assessment, weather tightness issues and population growth,” says Ms Kaye.

“These two successful schools face significant challenges due to population growth and the age of their buildings,” Ms Kaye says.

“Significant parts of Freemans Bay Primary need to be rebuilt to accommodate a rapidly increasing school roll and to repair leaky buildings. The estimated cost of this is around $10 million,” Ms Parata says. “The school is part of the Western Bays network, which has projected long-term population growth and is currently engaged in community consultation about how to manage that growth.

“Southern Cross Campus needs to modernise its infrastructure to support increased accommodation for the Southern Cross Trades Academy and location of Resource Teacher: Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) resources, which support several schools in South Auckland. The estimated cost of this is around $20 million,” says Ms Kaye.

“Work is continuing to identify and prioritise schools for inclusion in the six-year programme. The next schools confirmed for major property developments will be announced early next year.

“This is an essential programme of work to resolve complex education infrastructure issues impacting schools,” says Ms Parata.

“It will have a direct, positive impact on the learning environments of young New Zealanders. Addressing these issues for schools will help create more inspiring and quality learning environments and ensure school leaders can retain their focus on delivering the best educational outcomes.”

**Auckland school redevelopment Q and As**

**1. What is the basis for including schools in the six-year redevelopment programme?**

The Ministry of Education is considering schools that are facing difficulties caused by issues such as ageing facilities and the pressure on existing facilities of growing student numbers.

Schools to be included in the programme will have multiple property issues such as out dated infrastructure; leaky buildings; the need for earthquake strengthening; and/ or insufficient learning space.

Such issues have the potential to adversely impact school operations.

Fixing these issues as quickly as possible will require a coordinated approach and provide opportunities to deliver modern, inspiring learning environments in a cost effective way.

**2.** **On what basis were the first two schools identified?** 

***Freemans Bay***

Significant parts of Freemans Bay Primary need to be rebuilt to accommodate roll growth and remediate leaky buildings.

Redevelopment of Freemans Bay will contribute to sustainable education provision for the Western Bays community, which has a school network with projected long-term population growth.

Consultation with the Western Bays community is ongoing regarding the identification of appropriate and sustainable long-term solutions for the community’s education provision.

***Southern Cross***

Southern Cross Campus has both ageing buildings and parts of its infrastructure reaching the end of its economic life.

Additional accommodation is needed to house the Southern Cross Trades Academy and Resource Teacher: Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) resources, which provide support to several schools in South Auckland.

**3.** **How much funding will be committed to the first two schools in the programme?**

Detailed cost estimates are still to be finalised but at this stage we have a high-level estimate of around $30 million.

**4.** **How will property works be accelerated through the new programme?**

Rather than schools trying to manage a high number of small projects, the Ministry of Education will create an integrated, tailored, major redevelopment programme for each school. This will accelerate works and create cost-efficiencies through central procurement of services and materials needed.

5\. **When are the proposed developments expected to be completed?**

Freemans Bay Primary – August 2015

Southern Cross Campus – late 2015.

**6.** **When will you announce other schools to be included in the programme?**

This is a six-year programme involving an estimated 30 schools.

Work is continuing to identify and prioritise schools for inclusion in the programme.

The next schools confirmed for major development are expected to be announced by March 2014.

7\. **Will schools identified for the programme be expected to manage the redevelopment projects?**

No.

These are large-scale, complex property redevelopment projects that will be managed by the Ministry’s new Education Infrastructure Services in consultation with the schools.

**8.** **How are the redevelopments being funded?**

The Ministry is reprioritising funds for these works from existing baseline.

**9.** **What will the impact be on schools’ 5YA and 10PP funding?**

A school’s five year agreement funding (5YA) is Crown funding provided to maintain Crown-owned buildings – so it will be applied to support the redevelopment programme.

The Ministry’s School Property Advisors will work with schools to develop a new 10-year property plan (10PP) to cover the ongoing management and maintenance of redeveloped buildings.

**10.** **What other assistance is available for schools with serious property issues that are not on the list?**

Schools continue to have 5YA and 10YPP funding provided to support property maintenance and development.

Schools have access to School Property Advisors who are available to discuss concerns with property matters.

**11.** **Can I get my schools added to or moved further up the priority list?**

No.

The Ministry monitors schools with the highest priority property needs and is working through a process of prioritisation to identify those with the most complex issues.

Any school with urgent concerns about the priority given to its property issues should contact its School Property Advisor immediately.
