Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today turned the sod to mark the beginning of construction for the Pomare mixed housing redevelopment in Lower Hutt.

“Pomare epitomises the old intensive state housing model we are moving away from. The Government is creating more mixed communities of state, social and low-cost housing for first home buyers and growing families,” Dr Smith says.

“This sod turning is a significant event for the community and an important milestone in the history of the redevelopment.

“The project will see the construction of around 150 new homes. Up to 20 will be kept as state houses for high need families and will be a mix of one and two bedroom units and large four and five bedroom homes. Another 20 will be community social houses run through providers such as Accessible Properties and the Wellington Housing Trust. The remainder will be on-sold as low cost homes and aimed at first home buyers and large families.

“All of the homes will be modern, well-designed and energy efficient with enhanced green spaces and improved links to transport.”

Stage one of the redevelopment project, run by Housing New Zealand and development partner City Living, involves 34 homes at the end of Farmer Crescent and High Street and is expected to be completed next year. The entire redevelopment project is expected to be completed in 2016.

“The Pomare housing redevelopment project is part of Housing New Zealand’s record $2.9 billion three-year investment to ensure state houses are in the right place, are of the right size and are warm, dry and safe,” Dr Smith says.
