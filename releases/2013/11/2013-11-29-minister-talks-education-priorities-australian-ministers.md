Education Minister Hekia Parata met with her counterpart, Hon Christopher Pyne, Federal Minister for Education for Australia today at the Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood Education in Sydney.

“This meeting was a chance to profile New Zealand’s education system, and to talk about our key education priorities including: New Zealand’s challenge to ensure that five out of five students enjoy success in education, enabling families and whānau to be better engaged through the communication of achievement data; and valuing and strengthening the status of the teaching profession,” says Ms Parata.

“Given the close relationship with Australia it is very helpful to have these opportunities to share information and thinking and learn from each other.’’

The Standing Council, which meets around three times a year, comprises State, Territory, Australian Government and New Zealand Ministers with responsibility for the portfolios of school education, early childhood development and youth affairs.

Ms Parata also took the opportunity to invite Australia to the fourth International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP), which New Zealand will host in March 2014.

“The ISTP is an opportunity to showcase the great things happening in the New Zealand education system and to have a productive discussion between Ministers, leaders and the teaching sector on the big challenges faced by our education systems,” says Ms Parata.

New Zealand’s main focus over the past year has been raising achievement for five out of five children.

“Our Government’s education plan has an unrelenting focus on giving all of our children a better education and raising achievement for five out of five kids.”
