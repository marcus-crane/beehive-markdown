Local Government Minister Chris Tremain says the passage of the Environment Canterbury (Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management) Amendment Bill will leave Canterbury better off. The Bill passed its third reading in Parliament yesterday.

“The Commissioners have done an outstanding job in turning around the situation in Canterbury over the last three years,” says Mr Tremain.

“They have been very effective in developing a clear vision for the sustainable management of natural resources in the region, making huge progress through the Canterbury Water Management Strategy. Their record also includes decreasing the rate of rates increases; improving resource consent timeframes; strengthening iwi partnerships; and successful applications to the Government’s Fresh Water Clean-Up Fund.

“The Government’s intention is to transition Canterbury back to elections by 2016, with a review in 2014. However, it is crucial that the Commissioners complete their work, lest the region go backwards. Strong, stable and effective leadership is the best thing for Canterbury at this point in time.”
