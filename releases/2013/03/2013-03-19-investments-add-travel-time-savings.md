Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee is calling on the Green Party to embrace the Government’s Roads of National Significance programme following the most recent survey of their impact on congestion and the ensuing benefits to the environment.

“It’s early days, but already New Zealanders are getting great value for money from the Government’s investment in the seven Roads of National Significance,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Survey results from the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) show average travel time savings of up to five minutes per trip on sections of state highways that are part of the Roads of National Significance programme.

“Easing traffic congestion is essential to unlocking New Zealand’s economic potential - a fact which has underpinned the Roads of National Significance programme.

“Moving people and freight between and within our major cities more efficiently and safely represents a critical investment in our economic future.”

The seven Roads of National Significance are linked to the five largest centres of economic activity – Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington and Christchurch - and are focused on reducing congestion, improving road safety and providing improved links to New Zealand’s major sea and air ports.

The NZTA survey measured average travel times on three state highway sections that have been completed to date, and show the following:

- Victoria Park Tunnel – the 2012 opening of the third lane has reduced travel times by between five and 17 minutes per trip
- Te Rapa section of the Waikato Expressway – average travel time savings of 3.5 minutes
- State Highways 1 and 2 interchange at Ngauranga, Wellington – travel time savings of two minutes

Also completed but not yet surveyed is the 8km four-laned stretch of Stage 1 of the Christchurch Southern Motorway, along with a 2.5km upgrade of Halswell Junction Road.

“Already truck drivers are reporting travel time savings of 15 minutes between Rolleston and the Port of Lyttelton – a fuel saving of 10 litres per journey – and private car drivers are reporting greater time savings as they make their daily commute into or across the city,” Mr Brownlee says.

“These travel time savings are just the beginning, with much of the Roads of National Significance programme still to come, but already these roads are delivering huge benefits to productivity and the environment.

“Easing the most significant pressure points in the network will have flow on effects for all regions, encouraging business growth, tourism and jobs.”
