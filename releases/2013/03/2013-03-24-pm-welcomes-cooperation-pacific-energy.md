Prime Minister John Key has welcomed Pacific leaders, energy experts, and members of the private sector at the Cloud in Auckland tonight where they have gathered ahead of the two-day Pacific Energy Summit. 

The Pacific Energy Summit is designed to fast track solutions to the Pacific’s pressing energy needs by connecting Pacific Island leaders and their energy plans with organisations such as the EU, the World and Asian Development banks, and with technical experts and businesses from the private sector.

“We want this summit to generate tangible project investments, which will reduce the Pacific region’s reliance on expensive fossil fuels for electricity.  By the end of it, we expect investment announcements across a range of energy projects in the region,” Mr Key says.

Mr Key says the investment showcase will run in parallel with the Summit and exhibit the latest in renewable energy technologies along with the engineering, infrastructure and consultancy services required to make that technology work. The event itself will be partially powered by solar panels installed by Vector for the summit.

Mr Key urged the diverse audience of more than 400 delegates and 100 companies to make the most of this unique event. 

“By pooling resources, experiences and talents over the next two days we can put the Pacific firmly on the path to greater energy security and independence,” Mr Key says.
