Police Minister Anne Tolley says criminals and gangs are being hit hard as a result of having to forfeit the proceeds of their crimes.

322 assets worth an estimated $26 million have been forfeited by convicted criminals since the National-led Government introduced the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act in December 2009.

Around $21 million was taken from drug offenders, with over $15 million of this coming from methamphetamine associated offences.

Items forfeited include boats, cars, motorbikes, cash and bank accounts, houses and lifestyle blocks.

In the latest case, a Hamilton company director involved in drug dealing has today been sentenced to 12 years and has been stripped of assets worth around $5.1 million, including a farm, a lifestyle block, and two cars.

“Criminals are being hit where it hurts by this legislation,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They are losing their freedom, while their ill-gotten gains are no longer waiting for them when they are released from prison.

“As well as losing the profits from their crimes, offenders are also having to hand over properties which have been used to manufacture and store drugs.

“So criminals are getting what they deserve, and need to get the message that we are serious about locking them up and putting them out of business.

“Our Police are continuing to get great results, and well done to the Waikato Police for today’s successful case.”

The legislation allows Police to seize assets believed to be the proceeds of crime without first securing a criminal conviction, and they currently hold restraining orders worth an estimated $109.5 million. Upon conviction, the assets are forfeited to the Crown.
