Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce welcomed Statistics New Zealand data released today that shows businesses in New Zealand spent $1.2 billion on research and development in 2012 – an increase of almost 25 per cent since 2010.

“The positive results highlight the good progress the Government is making under the Business Growth Agenda to encourage more firms to invest in R&D and increase productivity in the economy,” Mr Joyce says.

“This jump in business R&D was described by Statistics New Zealand as ‘noteworthy’ and resulted from the Government directing funding towards business R&D and stimulating funding increases from businesses themselves.

“We are investing $115 million a year in TechNZ co-funding programmes with companies, and so far $657 million alongside business in the Primary Growth Partnership. The benefit of these programmes is that they co-fund additional R&D.

“We have also established Callaghan Innovation to assist firms with their R&D programmes. The Government has budgeted $166 million on the ATI development over the next four years.

“Business R&D has risen since we scrapped Labour’s so-called R&D tax credit which encouraged firms to reclassify existing spending into R&D to claim support.

“To get higher economic growth and greater prosperity, New Zealand companies and industries as a whole will have to keep investing more in innovation.

“We want to make New Zealand a more innovative, internationally competitive nation. More investment in R&D will allow our businesses to compete more effectively in the wider world.”
