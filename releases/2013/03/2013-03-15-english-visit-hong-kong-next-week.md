Finance Minister Bill English will visit Hong Kong for two days next week, where he will deliver a keynote speech to the annual Asia Investment Conference and meet a number of business and political leaders.

Mr English will be in Hong Kong on 19 and 20 of March, returning to New Zealand on 21 March.

“Asia is an important and growing export and investment partner for New Zealand and I’m keen to keep building on our relationships in the region,” he says.

“While other parts of the world, particularly Europe and the United States, are struggling with too much debt and little or no growth, Asia continues to provide New Zealand with opportunities.

“Trade is an important part of the Government’s programme to build a more productive and competitive economy. In particular, as part of our Business Growth Agenda, we have set a target of increasing exports from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of GDP by 2025.”

The Asian Investment Conference is one of Asia-Pacific’s longest running forums, and attracts a wide range of influential corporate leaders, economists, policy makers and investors.

Mr English speaks to the conference on 20 March.

“I’m looking forward to meeting the participants and discussing the Government’s economic programme with them.”

Mr English will also meet business and political leaders, including Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary John Tsang.
