Customs Minister Maurice Williamson has congratulated five Customs Service detector dog handlers and their canine colleagues at a graduation ceremony in Upper Hutt today.

“Detector dogs play a vital role in Customs work. These highly skilled dogs and their detection abilities help us find illicit drugs and explosives.”

Detector dogs are recruited for their attitude, temperament and retrieval instincts.  Customs’ drug detector dogs are trained to detect a wide variety of illegal drugs, such as cocaine, cannabis, methamphetamine (‘P’) and precursors used to manufacture methamphetamine.

“A key priority for the Government is to disrupt the supply of illicit drugs, and detector dogs are helping in a major way,” Mr Williamson says.

All of Customs’ detector dogs come from the Australian Customs and Border Protection’s dog breeding and training facility in Melbourne.  This world class facility provides high quality detector dogs to agencies globally. 

Amongst those graduating from the Police Dog Training Centre at Trentham today was the 2000th dog to be bred in the Australian programme.

“We are privileged to have the 2000th dog from the Australian programme protecting our border, Rajax.  He’s a lively lab and his handler describes him as everything you look for in a detector dog.”

Earlier this month Rajax made his first interception of the drug MDMA concealed in a parcel at the International Mail Centre.

Customs has received 24 detector dogs from the Australian programme.
