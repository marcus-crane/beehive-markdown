Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the appointment of Dr Mary Quin as the inaugural Chief Executive of Callaghan Innovation.

“The appointment is a key step in the development of Callaghan Innovation following its establishment on 1 February this year,” Mr Joyce says.

“Callaghan Innovation will be a one-stop shop for business innovation support whether it be in the science, engineering, design or technology sectors. It will be a high-tech HQ for New Zealand businesses.

“Core to the organisation’s success will be its ability to work across these sectors. It’s great to see that the Board has attracted someone with Dr Quin’s background and experience spans these disciplines – particularly in the technology and engineering industries.

“Dr Quin’s international experience will be invaluable as Callaghan Innovation continues to establish itself as an organisation that can translate smart ideas into high-tech products and services that we can sell to world markets.

“This is another excellent example of a New Zealander, who has succeeded on the world stage, coming back home committed to the on-going development and success of the country.”

Callaghan Innovation brings together the former crown research institute IRL, MBIE’s business investments team, the Auckland Foodbowl, and NZTE's Lean Manufacturing programme.

It is a key part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda and received funding in Budget 2012 of $166 million over four years.
