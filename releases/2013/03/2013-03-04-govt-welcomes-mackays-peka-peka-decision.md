Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee today welcomed the draft decision approving regulatory and resource consent applications for the SH1 MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway by an independent Board of Inquiry under the Government’s national consenting process with the Environmental Protection Authority.

“The Government welcomes the Board of Inquiry's draft decision to approve the regulatory and resource consent applications for the Mackays to Peka Peka Expressway and we look forward to the Board's final decision in April,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This is a significant milestone towards the progression of this nationally significant road, which would be a key component of the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance, and provide a much safer, efficient and more resilient transport route north of Wellington.

"April’s decision will provide welcome certainty for the people of Kapiti and the thousands of road users who rely on this busy highway lifeline."

The Wellington Northern Corridor is one of seven Roads of National Significance being progressed by the Government to improve economic productivity and road safety on New Zealand's most important strategic transport routes.

Subject to the Board of Inquiry's final decision, construction on the MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway could begin as early as 1 July, and be completed in 2017.
