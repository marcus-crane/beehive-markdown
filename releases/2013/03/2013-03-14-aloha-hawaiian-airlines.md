Associate Minister of Tourism Chris Tremain says today’s arrival of Hawaiian Airlines’ inaugural flight of their new Honolulu to Auckland service is a boost to tourism and will offer New Zealanders a greater choice in flying to the United States.

“This new service has real value for both New Zealand and Hawaii. The new route opens up access to Hawaiian airlines main markets such as San Diego, Seattle, Las Vegas and New York. It’s also an exciting opportunity to grow tourism in one of our premier markets.

“Hawaiian Airlines is a significant and fast growing US based carrier. The reaction to their New Zealand service has been fantastic. Due to high demand they have already increased the number of their flights from three to four per week during the peak period.

“The United States market makes up seven per cent of our international visitors and it is great we are already seeing the positive impact this new route will have in attracting more visitors to New Zealand.”
