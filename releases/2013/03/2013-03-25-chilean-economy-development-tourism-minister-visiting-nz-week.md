Chilean Economy, Development and Tourism Minister Pablo Longueira is visiting New Zealand this week to carry out discussions on education, Māori economic development and tourism.

Minister Longueira, who was invited to visit New Zealand by Prime Minister John Key during his recent Latin America trip, arrives today for a four-day visit. He will be accompanied by a 21-strong delegation including the Governor of the Araucania, business representatives and Chilean media.

“Our relationship with Chile is thriving following the recent visit by the Prime Minister. There is a high level of co-operation in energy development, the environment, agriculture and education,” Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“New Zealand is a popular destination for Chilean students and we would like to encourage more to study here. An important objective of Minister Longueira’s visit is to secure New Zealand’s place as a leading education destination for the Chilean government’s ‘Penguins Without Borders’ scholarship scheme.

“Minister Longueira has a keen interest in developing Chile’s indigenous tourism sector and his visit provides an opportunity to develop a strong relationship between Māori tourism organisations and the indigenous Mapuche people in Chile.”
