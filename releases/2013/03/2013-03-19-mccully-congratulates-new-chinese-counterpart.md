Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today congratulated his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, following his appointment to the 12th National People’s Congress in Beijing.

“New Zealand and China have an expanding bilateral relationship with strong political, economic and cultural connections,” Mr McCully says.

“Both New Zealand and China are interested in cooperating on issues that affect the Asia-Pacific region.

“I look forward to holding talks with Minister Wang and wish him the best as he takes on his new role.

“I congratulate former Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on his appointment as State Councillor – the highest ranking official on foreign policy.

“Minister Yang and I have enjoyed an excellent working relationship over the past four years. I wish him well in his new role in which I am sure he will continue to exert a highly positive influence on the relationship between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.
