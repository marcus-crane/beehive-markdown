Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew says more women than ever before are taking part in potentially lifesaving screening programmes for the early detection of breast and cervical cancer.  

“72 per cent of women eligible for breast screening had mammograms last year – 10 per cent more than in 2008,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“And nearly 60,000 more women took part in the National Cervical Screening Programme last year compared to four years ago. A total of 870,000 smear tests were carried out last year.

“Breast cancer is the most common cancer in New Zealand women and early detection through mammograms increases the chance of beating cancer.

“Likewise, women who have cervical smear tests reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer by as much as 90 per cent,” says Mr Goodhew.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said the government is committed to improving screening, diagnostic and cancer treatment for New Zealanders and their families.

“We are investing an additional $33 million over the next four years for better and faster services for cancer patients,” says Mr Ryall

“In the past two years we’ve invested $10 million to support the rollout of digital mammography at five screening centres. And a further $4 million will be spent this year to assist the remaining three services to be digital by December 2013.

"The digital machines will replace traditional film images which sometimes had to be couriered to a radiologist for assessment and then reported to the patient's doctor. The digital technology will enable mammograms to be viewed by doctors across the country and speed up breast cancer testing for patients.

“Early detection and screening saves lives.  While these figures are positive we want more women to have regular screening and I encourage you to talk to your GP or phone the national screening teams," says Mr Ryall.
