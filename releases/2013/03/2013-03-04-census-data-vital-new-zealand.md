Tomorrow is census day and everyone stands to benefit if they fill in their forms, says Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson.

The census is the five-yearly snapshot of New Zealand and is the only opportunity to get an official count of everyone and their dwellings.

“Statisticians love this sort of thing but the real benefit is in how the information is used.

“The Government needs to know how many people there are in each part of the country so there can be informed decisions about spending money on hospitals, roads, public transport, kōhanga reo and many other things.

“Community groups, councils and iwi also need to plan ahead and the census provides them with the information required to do that,” Mr Williamson says.

It’s expected about two million census forms (individual and dwelling) will be filled out online this census.

“I would encourage people to use this option, as it’s quick, easy and secure.”

All census information is kept confidential by Statistics New Zealand and can only be used for statistical purposes.

Anyone who has not received their census forms and internet access code should phone 0800 CENSUS (0800 236787).
