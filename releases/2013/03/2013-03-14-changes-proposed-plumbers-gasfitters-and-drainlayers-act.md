The Government is moving to amend Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers legislation to ensure the Board which enforces it can do its job of protecting public safety effectively.

Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says it is apparent there is an issue with how the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board fee and levy funding provisions work.

The Regulations Review Committee received complaints about the validity of fees and levies that fund the Board’s statutory prosecution function.

The Government will attempt to amend the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006 to validate the disciplinary levy and offences fee, and clarify the Board's authority to impose levies.

“It has always been the Government's intention that the Board's prosecution function would be funded by the industry. This is how all other boards in the building and construction sector operate,” Mr Williamson says.

“The industry benefits from maintaining high standards and stopping unqualified people putting the public at risk and taking work from skilled tradespeople. The Board’s prosecution and disciplinary functions play a key role in that process.”

The Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Amendment Bill was tabled on Monday and had its first reading in Parliament this afternoon.

The Government Administration Select Committee will consider the Bill over the next week, and invite submissions on it.
