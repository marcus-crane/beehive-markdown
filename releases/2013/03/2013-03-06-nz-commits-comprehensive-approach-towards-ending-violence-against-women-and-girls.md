Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced New Zealand’s pledge under the UN Women initiative Commit.

“I am pleased to announce that we have added our voice to those of the 46 other Governments around the world who have promised to take action to end violence against women and girls through Commit,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“This initiative urges Governments to take steps to ensure that women and girls are able to lead violence-free lives.

“Some of the ways in which New Zealand continues to address this challenge include improving the legislative framework that covers protection of and support for victims and accountability of offenders, the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families, Family Violence Ministerial Group and the Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme.

“Through these initiatives we pledge our commitment to a zero tolerance policy for violence against women and girls.

Mrs Goodhew is currently in New York attending the UN Commission on the Status of Women.
