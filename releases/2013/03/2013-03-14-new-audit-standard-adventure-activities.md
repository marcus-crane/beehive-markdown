Labour Minister Simon Bridges has announced the release of a new safety audit standard for adventure activities in New Zealand.

“This new standard sets a bar for adventure activity operators who are required to pass a safety audit before they can become registered,” says Mr Bridges.

“It sets out the requirements operators must comply with to reduce risks in providing adventure activities. There will always be a level of risk with these types of activities, but commercial operators must take all practicable steps to operate safely.”

Mr Bridges says New Zealand is renowned for its adventure tourism and the new safety audit standard is part of a range of initiatives introduced over the last three years to strengthen the safety of the industry.

“Following a review in 2009/2010 of safety measures in the adventure tourism sector, new regulations governing commercial adventure activities came into effect in November 2011 and are being fully implemented.

“The new safety audit standard has been developed in consultation with the adventure and outdoors sector, the public and government agencies. I want to thank Outdoors New Zealand and the Tourism Industry Association, in particular, for their contributions,” Mr Bridges says.

Once operating against the new safety standard, operators will be re-audited at least every three years. It will be an offence for an operator to provide any adventure activity, as defined by the Regulations, without being registered.
