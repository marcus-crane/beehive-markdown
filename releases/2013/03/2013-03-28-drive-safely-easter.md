Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is urging everyone to drive safely during the Easter holidays.

“Last Easter we all showed we can make a difference when for the first time since records began in 1956 no-one was killed on our roads. We want another zero road toll this Easter.

“Holiday driving requires extra care and patience – we want every journey to be a safe journey.

“Plan your trip, check your vehicle, turn off your mobile phone and make sure everyone is wearing their seatbelt. Then you can better enjoy the drive.”

Police will be out in force this weekend targeting drunk, drugged and dangerous driving to help ensure safe journeys.

“Road safety is everyone’s responsibility,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The official Easter holiday period runs from 4pm, Thursday 28 March, and ends at 6am, Tuesday 2 April.
