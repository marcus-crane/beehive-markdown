Police Minister Anne Tolley says illegal street racing offences have fallen by 35 per cent since 2009, after the National-led Government introduced legislation to combat boy racers.

Offences dropped from 2738 in 2009 to 1759 in 2012. In the same period, road deaths for 15-24 year olds reduced from 105 to 65.

“We are seeing encouraging results, with almost a thousand fewer offences in 2012 compared to 2009, but the number is still too high,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This legislation and the vigilance of our Police is having a real effect in reducing offences and repeat offenders, and lowering the risk of injury to innocent people and the boy racers themselves.”

From a total of 8,765 offences since 2009, only 172 offenders are on two strikes, while ten drivers have three convictions. Judges have discretion to grant destruction orders on vehicles, and have done so in three cases. So far, one has been crushed, one is in storage while ownership issues are clarified and the third was seized and sold to a training institution for mechanical trainees before the order was made.

“Crushing cars is not the target,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It is an effective deterrent, alongside good Police work, to reduce tragic deaths and injuries on our roads, and to stop lives being ruined.

“The dangerous and anti-social behaviour from illegal street racers has no place in our communities and will not be tolerated on our streets.

“The message is clear. The crackdown on boy racers will continue and they can expect to lose their cars if their behaviour doesn’t change.”

***Notes***

In 2009, two new laws came into effect:

The Sentencing (Vehicle Confiscation) Amendment Act which:

- Allows vehicles to be seized and destroyed as a new penalty for illegal street racing
- Allows vehicles repeatedly used by people with overdue traffic fines to be seized and sold to pay those fines
- Enables Police and Courts to target illegal street racers who commit offences in another person's vehicle

And, the Land Transport (Enforcement Powers) Act which:

- Allows local authorities to create bylaws that prevent vehicles repeatedly “cruising” city streets
- Allows the compulsory impoundment of vehicles involved in illegal street racing
- Introduces demerit points for noise offences, licence breaches and registration plate offences.
