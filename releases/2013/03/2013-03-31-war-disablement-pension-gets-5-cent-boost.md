Those on the War Disablement Pension and Surviving Spouse Pension will benefit from a one-off 5 per cent increase from 1 April, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse confirmed today.

“This special one-off 5 per cent boost to the War Disablement Pension and Surviving Spouse Pension shows the Government is delivering on its election promise to better recognise and support our veterans and ex-servicemen.

“This is good news for nearly 17,000 veterans and surviving spouses that will benefit from the increase. It equates to a boost of more than $5 million in what are tight economic times, and demonstrates the Government's commitment to those who have given service to our country,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The increase comes on top of the annual cost of living adjustment for all war pensions and allowances, including a 2.44 per cent increase for the Veterans’ Pension to maintain the married rate at 66 per cent of the average net wage.

Examples of the increased rates are:

•           A veteran on a 100 per cent War Disablement Pension will now receive a tax free payment of $214.00 per week (an extra $11.43 a week).

•           The Surviving Spouse’s Pension will increase to $157.86 per week, tax free (an extra $8.43 week).

•           A couple on Veteran’s Pension will receive a gross amount of $620.68 per week (up from $604.80).

"In addition to the War Disablement Pension, a range of other allowances have also been increased. All these payments are tax free and paid in addition to employment income or other assistance such as the Veteran’s Pension or New Zealand Superannuation,” Mr Woodhouse says.

As of 28 February 2013 there were 11,029 veterans in receipt of a War Disablement Pension and 5791 Surviving Spouse Pension recipients.
