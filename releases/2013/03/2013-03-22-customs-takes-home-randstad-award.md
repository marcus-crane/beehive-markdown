Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today congratulated the Customs Service on being voted the most attractive employer for the public sector at the Randstad Awards.

It is the second year in a row Customs has won this award.

“This is an outstanding achievement that reflects the importance and quality of Customs’ services, and the vital role it plays in protecting our border and furthering international trade and travel.”

“Not only were Customs voted most attractive public service employer, it was also named New Zealand’s second most attractive company to work for. This demonstrates the high regard Customs is held in and the trust and confidence the organisation engenders.”

“Customs is New Zealand’s oldest government department with a strong brand and solid reputation, and these accolades prove the organisation is up there with the best”.

The Randstad Awards are based on the perceptions of 7000 jobseekers surveyed about the companies they recognise.  

The awards are held in 14 countries.  2013 is the second year Randstad Awards have been conducted in New Zealand.
