Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced final decisions for 12 schools in greater Christchurch affected by the Government’s Education Renewal Plans.

Ms Parata announced interim decisions for 31 schools on 18 February.  Of those 31 schools, 12 have accepted their interim decisions.

“This is an important step forward. I would like thank the boards and wider school communities for their input during this process. We have listened to communities and we will continue to do so,’’ says Ms Parata.

“The Government is absolutely committed to rebuilding Christchurch – that’s why we are investing $1 billion into restoring and renewing the education sector in Canterbury over the next 10 years.

“Greater Christchurch will have one of the most modern schooling networks in the country that will serve communities for many years to come, and help each and every child get a great education.”

The final decisions are:

- Burnham Primary School, Burnside Primary School, Duvauchelle School, Okains Bay School, Ouruhia Model School and Shirley Intermediate will remain open.

<!--THE END-->

- Bromley School and Linwood Avenue schools, and Yaldhurst Model and Gilberthorpe schools will no longer be merged.

<!--THE END-->

- Discovery One School and Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti schools will merge as a Year 1-13 designated character school effective from 27 January 2014

“A number of boards indicated to me that they wanted a final decision for their school as soon as possible so I told them if they formally accepted their interim decision before 28 March, I was happy to make a decision sooner and that’s what I have done,’’ says Ms Parata.

“It has been clear to me throughout this process that parents, teachers and children all want certainty.

“I look forward to receiving feedback from the remaining 19 schools on their interim decisions before I make my final decisions at the end of May.’’

 

*NOTES:*

Of the 215 schools in greater Christchurch, 177 schools, or more than 80 per cent, are not affected by the Government’s proposals.

In summary, of the 38 schools covered in the original proposals announced in September last year:

- 12 schools now have final decisions
- Burnham Primary School, Burnside Primary School, Duvauchelle School, Okains Bay School, Ouruhia Model School and Shirley Intermediate will remain open.
- Bromley School and Linwood Avenue Schools, and Yaldhurst Model and Gilberthorpe Schools will not be merged.
- Discovery One School and Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti schools’ will be merged.
- 17 schools have interim decisions to close or merge
- Of these 17 schools, 7 should close and 10 should merge (to create five schools). These schools have until tomorrow (28 March) to provide feedback on their interim decisions.
- It was originally proposed that the two kura TKKM o Waitaha and TKKM o Te Whānau Tahi would merge however the interim decision is now for both kura to remain open and one be relocated to provide Māori medium provision to north of Christchurch. The kura have until tomorrow (28 March) to provide feedback to the Ministry around which kura should move.
- Five schools in Aranui (Aranui, Avondale, Wainoni, Chisnallwood Intermediate, and Aranui High School) had an extended initial consultation period to 7 March 2013. It is proposed those schools form a new Year 1-13 campus. The Ministry is currently reviewing submissions from those schools with the intent of announcing interim decisions on 9 May.
- Two schools have already closed voluntarily. Those schools are Hammersley Park and Le Bons Bay.

A rebuilt Burnside Primary will feature a community education hub and will share facilities with neighbouring Cobham Intermediate.

Duvauchelle School and Okains Bay School will pursue enhanced collaboration between their schools, and may give consideration to shared governance arrangements.

Ouruhia Model School will remain open and may be relocated to a new site in Belfast in the future.

The Government is building or rebuilding 15 schools in greater Christchurch over the next 10 years.
