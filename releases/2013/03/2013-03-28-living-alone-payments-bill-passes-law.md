Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the passing of the Social Assistance (Living Alone Payments) Amendment Bill into law.

“The changes passed today will make it easier for single superannuitants and single veteran’s pensioners living alone who need financial support.”

“We’ve simplified the application system and removed unnecessary barriers for older New Zealanders to ensure they get their full entitlement.’’

The new law amends the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 and the War Pensions Act 1954 so that single superannuitants and single veteran’s pensioners living alone don’t have to make a separate application to receive their full entitlement.

The living alone payment was a separate, supplementary benefit that recognised that single superannuitants and veteran’s pensioners who live alone, face higher living costs as they are unable to share the expenses of maintaining a household.

Because the living alone payment was a separate benefit, superannuitants and veteran’s pensioners who have become single, usually after the death of a partner or spouse, were required to make a specific application to receive it.

The Living Alone Payment has been replaced by a new rate of payment for people living alone that can be paid as people’s circumstances changes.

Superannuitants will now also be able to apply by phone or email and no longer need to visit a Work and Income office to fill out an application.

This legislative change will not be retrospective.
