Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of Hayden Montgomery as Ambassador to Argentina.

“New Zealand and Argentina share many interests ranging from global agricultural trade liberalisation to Antarctica and the Southern Oceans,” Mr McCully says.

“As Argentina is one of the world’s main agriculture and livestock producers, there is tremendous scope for our industries to work together to meet the increasing global demand for food, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.

“There has already been significant New Zealand investment in Argentina’s fisheries and dairy sectors as well as, more recently, new ventures in pasture seed, high quality wine, tourism, and veterinary products.”

Mr Montgomery has extensive experience as lead negotiator for New Zealand on climate change policy for agriculture and forestry.

His previous roles include First Secretary (Agriculture) at the New Zealand Embassy in Paris and Special Adviser to the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.

Mr Montgomery will also be cross-accredited as Ambassador to Uruguay.
