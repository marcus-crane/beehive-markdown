Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says a new collaborative approach towards the management and disposal of Crown land will deliver significant benefits.

“Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) has established the Crown Land Centre of Expertise, which will provide other Government agencies with advice and assistance in relation to Crown land.”

LINZ manages more than 5,000 properties (about two million hectares of the land) and is responsible for administering many land related laws.

“This experience and expertise makes LINZ well placed to assist agencies for which the management of Crown land may not be a core function. The Centre of Expertise will save time and money. In fact, a number of Crown agencies are already seeing the benefits of working with LINZ,” Maurice Williamson says.

An example of this is the Department of Corrections, which recently transferred the former Wellington Prison to LINZ for management and disposal through the Centre.

“The Crown Land Centre of Expertise continues to take shape, and exemplifies public sector innovation and collaboration. It will enable agencies to focus on what they do best – providing services to New Zealand.”
