Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew departs on Sunday on a trip to New York, Washington, DC and Toronto.  From 4-6 March she will attend the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).

“CSW is the principal global policy‑making body dedicated exclusively to gender equality and the advancement of women,” says Mrs Goodhew. 

“Every year representatives of member states and observers gather in New York to evaluate progress on gender equality and identify challenges.

“This year’s theme is *Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls*, which aligns with my priority to increase women’s safety from violence. 

“New Zealand’s reputation on gender equality is strong internationally. However, I am clear that there are some areas where we can, and must, do better.  Ending violence against women is one such area, and sharing progress and exchanging ideas internationally will help us achieve this.”

Mrs Goodhew will also attend meetings with a number of organisations relevant to her Community and Voluntary Sector portfolio in New York, Washington, DC and Toronto, and relevant to her Associate Health portfolio in Toronto. 

“My focus will be on learning about cutting edge work that is being undertaken in the non-government sector in North America that is relevant to the Government’s priorities for the community and voluntary sector, in particular social finance and social enterprise, support for volunteering and government-community relationships.”

“I am also very interested to learn about the experiences and challenges within the Ontario health sector, especially in the areas of health of older people and service integration.”
