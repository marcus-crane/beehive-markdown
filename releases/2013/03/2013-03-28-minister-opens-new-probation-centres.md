Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has officially opened new community probation centres in Thames and Tauranga.

The Thames centre cost $1.4 million to build, with the Tauranga South facility costing $1.2 million, and each will provide safer and more modern environments for Corrections staff and community groups.

“Our staff work extremely hard to keep communities safe and to try and help offenders turn their lives around,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They deserve to be in surroundings which enable them to work constructively with offenders, and which also keep them safe.

“These new centres have enhanced safety features such as CCTV and glass interview rooms. They also have space for on-site training, meetings and delivery of rehabilitation programmes.

“Local community groups will also be able to take advantage of the new facilities, and I want to acknowledge the role they play in supporting our target of reducing reoffending.

“These new probation centres are an important addition to their communities, as we forge ahead with our targets of preventing crime, reducing the number of victims of crime and reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.”
