Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman has held a bilateral meeting in Auckland today with Viet Nam’s Minister of National Defence.

The visit by General Phung Quang Thanh is the first to New Zealand by a Viet Nam Minister of National Defence.

“This was a welcome opportunity for a bilateral meeting and we discussed a broad range of defence-related issues in Asia Pacific, as well as opportunities for future co-operation in the region,” said Dr Coleman.

General Thanh is in the country until March 25th.  His programme has included meetings with the Chief of Defence, Secretary of Defence, and a visit to the NZDF Joint Force headquarters.

New Zealand enjoys a productive bilateral relationship with Viet Nam. Prime Minister John Key visited Viet Nam twice in 2010. Minister Thanh’s visit is the third by a Vietnamese Politburo member to New Zealand since 2012.
