Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has announced that two new brochures are now available to provide information for older people receiving Government funded home support.

The brochures *What you can expect from home support services* and *What to do if you have a concern about your home support services* have been published by the Ministry of Health.

“These brochures will help assure older people of quality care in their homes and provide advice on what they should do if they do experience any problems with their care,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“Raising small concerns early, before they become bigger, is my key advice to older people receiving care at home.

“Home carers are in a position of trust. They work in people’s homes, usually by themselves, providing a service often highly valued by those receiving it.

“In some instances individuals receiving the care are unhappy about the services, but there is a view that only a very small number actually voice their complaint.

“Often people are concerned that their complaint may affect the care worker or they are worried that the care giver will treat them differently after they’ve complained.

“These new brochures set out what people with concerns can do, who they can raise them with and how best to do it – including using advocacy services to raise concerns on their behalf.”

The brochures also include information about how older people receiving care at home can help improve the quality of care provided, through participating in service surveys, annual reviews and talking to advocacy or consumer representative groups.

The two brochures available from the Ministry’s website [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz).
