200,000 New Zealanders have pre-registered their interest in buying shares in the Government's minority share offer of the energy company Mighty River Power.

State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall says the 200,000 mark for pre-registrations was reached at 3.30 this afternoon – less than three days after the preregistration website went live.

The great majority - 89 per cent - pre-registered online, the rest were divided equally between the Call Centre, and Smartphones," Mr Ryall says.

"We are offering New Zealanders a share in up to 49 per cent of Mighty River Power as part of the National Government's wider economic plan to control debt and keep investing in our economy."

"Many countries are facing an intensifying debt crisis and the Government's minority share offers programme will reduce the need to go further into debt to volatile overseas markets."

The website: [www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz](https://www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz), provides information to New Zealanders keen to register their interest in the share offer.

"There is plenty of time before pre-registration ends on 22 March – and there is no advantage in pre-registering earlier."

New Zealanders who pre-register will receive an offer document as soon as it's ready, and may be allocated up to 25% more shares than people who do not pre-register, if demand for shares exceeds shares available.

New Zealanders wanting information on pre-registration should visit: [www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz](https://www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz) or call 0800 90 30 90.
