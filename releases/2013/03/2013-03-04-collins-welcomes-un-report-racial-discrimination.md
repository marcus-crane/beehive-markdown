Justice and Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins has welcomed the latest report of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on New Zealand’s progress at tackling racial discrimination and inequality.

Ms Collins presented to the Committee on behalf of the New Zealand Government at a two-day meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on 21 and 22 February.

“I am very pleased to say that during the review, the Committee noted New Zealand’s efforts to combat racial discrimination represented many examples of best practice globally and that these would be recommended to other countries.

“The Committee specifically observed that New Zealand has put in place valuable programmes such as Better Public Services, Addressing the Drivers of Crime, the Youth Employment Package, the Alcohol and Other Drug Courts and the New Zealand Police ethnic strategy, aimed at improving ethnic relations and raising multi-cultural awareness.

“As an active player in the UN system, we are committed to meeting our obligations under the human rights treaties we are party to.

“New Zealand values diversity and prides itself on being an inclusive society. The convention mirrors the natural desire in every New Zealander to see that everyone is given a fair go.

“We will give serious consideration to the concluding observations made by the Committee, many of which are already being addressed, and will respond to them in due course,” Ms Collins said.

The UN’s 175 member countries are required to periodically report on the steps they take to eliminate racial discrimination, and to regularly appear before its

Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

The Committee is a panel of 18 independent experts elected by the convention’s member states. It last reviewed New Zealand in 2007. Its findings are not legally binding.
