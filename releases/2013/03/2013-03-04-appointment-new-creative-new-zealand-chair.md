Dr Richard Grant has been appointed chair of the Arts Council of Creative New Zealand, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Dr Grant replaces Alastair Carruthers, who has continued in the role pending new legislation which replaces the current governance structure with a new unitary Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa. Mr Carruthers is commencing a new role as the chief executive of a national law firm.

“I am very pleased that Richard Grant is available to be chair at a time of change for Creative New Zealand,” Mr Finlayson said. “The appointment ensures continuity, and Dr Grant’s strong understanding of Crown governance will provide clear leadership to the Council in the transition period.”

“I thank Alastair Carruthers for his exceptional contribution in his many years of service to Creative New Zealand. Under his leadership Creative New Zealand has worked to ensure the stability of key arts infrastructure organisations while also supporting the emergence of new groups. International events such as the Venice Biennale and the Festival of South Pacific Arts, and initiatives such as cultural philanthropy have also been a focus for Creative New Zealand under Alastair’s guidance.”

Dr Richard Grant had a distinguished diplomatic career for over 40 years working with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Europe, Australia, the Pacific, and Asia. A former New Zealand ambassador in Bonn and Paris and a former high commissioner in London and Singapore, Dr Grant has also been executive director of the Asia New Zealand Foundation. He has a strong interest in arts and culture.
