Fonterra Brands Malaysia’s launch of Mainland Cheese in Malaysia signals the strengthening trade links between New Zealand and South-East Asia, Minister for Economic Development Steven Joyce says.

Minister Joyce today launched the Mainland Cheese brand at a New Zealand Gala event in Kuala Lumpur.

“Over the last five years, Fonterra Brands Malaysia’s business in South East Asia has doubled, which shows the increasing demand for New Zealand dairy products, and the growing opportunities for New Zealand export companies in the region,” Mr Joyce says.

The launch coincides with New Zealand Week in Malaysia, a series of business and education events to lift the profile of New Zealand as an education destination, and to promote business and investment opportunities.

Malaysia is a key partner for Fonterra in the South-East Asia region. Fonterra’s two manufacturing plants in Malaysia employ 450 staff, and provide products to Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.

“Building export markets is an important part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda and we have set an ambitious target to grow our export revenue from 30 to 40 per cent of GDP by 2025.

“In order to achieve this, we need to make sure we take up every opportunity, particularly in Asian markets, to promote high quality New Zealand products. It is great to see Fonterra receiving such a positive reaction from the Malaysian market. There are many success stories of New Zealand businesses opening in Asia and many future opportunities to grow business here.”
