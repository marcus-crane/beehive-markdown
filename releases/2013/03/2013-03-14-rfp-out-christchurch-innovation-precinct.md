Firms with an interest in locating in the Christchurch Innovation Precinct are being asked to put up their hands.

Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the release of a Market Engagement document and a Request for Proposals for the Precinct, which is designed to be a catalyst for Christchurch to be recognised on the world stage as a hub of innovation.

“Today’s consultation documents are aimed at gaining a clear understanding of the level of interest private sector organisations have in being located in the Precinct, and what they would like to see in the area,” Mr Joyce says.

The documents also seek proposals from consultants to determine the high-level urban form and design principles for the Precinct.

“There has already been considerable interest from multinational firms, smaller domestic firms, investors and developers. We want them to play their part in creating an environment that innovative firms and institutes want to locate to. The Innovation Precinct should be market-led – responding to the needs of business with a global mind-set and ambitions.

“The clustering and collaboration of firms and researchers in a single, physical location is shown internationally to generate economic benefits by creating scale, providing an attractive environment for skilled workers and encouraging knowledge sharing – something that can also be achieved by the new Precinct.”

The Innovation Precinct is an important component of the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan with initial plans to facilitate the development of a 3.6 hectare site comprising three city blocks located in the south-east corner of the Urban Frame and bounded by Lichfield, Manchester, St Asaph Streets, High St, Tuam and Madras Streets.

Submissions to both the Market Engagement document and the Request for Proposal for a Spatial Framework close on 5 April 2013. Further information can be found at [www.gets.govt.nz](http://www.gets.govt.nz).

Submissions will be used to inform the next steps of delivery of the Innovation Precinct.
