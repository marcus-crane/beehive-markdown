Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has released today the Ministry of Education’s 2012 Export Education Levy data that show an increase of two per cent in international education sector revenues for 2012.

The data shows international tuition revenues have increased to $745.7 million – the highest level of revenue recorded since 2004.

The consequences of the Christchurch earthquake are continuing to impact international enrolments with a 31 per cent fall in the Canterbury region during 2012. International enrolments in the rest of New Zealand declined by three per cent.

Excluding the Canterbury data, international enrolments in polytechnics rose by four per cent, schools were up one per cent and universities levels remained at the same level.

Overall, there were six per cent fewer international fee paying students studying in New Zealand in 2012 compared to 2011. This can be compared with enrolments in Australia reporting a slightly greater decline of seven per cent.

The new data also shows the number of Chinese students, who contribute to 27 per cent of all New Zealand’s international students, has increased by four per cent. In Australia, the number of enrolments of Chinese students declined by six per cent.

“Institutions in all of our major cities have played an important part in making New Zealand an attractive destination for international students and these latest figures give a strong platform for continued growth,” Mr Joyce says.

“Despite the elevated New Zealand dollar, our high-quality education sector, together with the lifestyle experience that New Zealand provides for international students, is a combination few other countries can match.”
