Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says people caught at the border bringing in more than their allotted share of tobacco will be made to pay the duty and GST that’s owed.

Customs figures show mail interceptions of tobacco in 2012 were up more than 600 per cent on the previous year, with a total of 475 interceptions. There was a nine per cent increase in interceptions at airports, up from 1,683 to 1,838.

Anyone bringing in more than their personal concession of 200 cigarettes or 250 grams of tobacco is liable for GST and duty: about $117 for a carton of 200 cigarettes. This also applies to loose tobacco and chewing tobacco.

“In the majority of cases people were caught trying to bring in an additional carton or two of cigarettes, indicating the tobacco was for personal use.

“It shows people are trying harder to get around the rules as the price of tobacco gradually increases. All it is doing is taking up more of Customs’ time. People need to understand and follow the rules.

“If people hide that they have more than their allowance Customs can seize the tobacco, still charge duty and GST and even initiate a prosecution,” Mr Williamson says.

In 2012, Customs also caught a small number of individuals trying to avoid paying duty and GST on tobacco by using tour groups to import more than their concession and on selling the cigarettes to local retailers.

One Customs operation last year resulted in 52 interceptions of undeclared cigarettes and tobacco through mail and fast freight, with an excise value of almost $65,000. In another operation, 50 consignments of approximately 3,200 cigarettes each, with a value of about $84,000 in excise revenue, was seized from repeat offenders.
