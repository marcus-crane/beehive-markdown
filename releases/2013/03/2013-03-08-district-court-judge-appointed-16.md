Tauranga lawyer Rob Ronayne has been appointed a Judge of the District Court with a jury warrant to sit in Auckland, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Judge Ronayne was admitted to the bar in 1978 after graduating from Canterbury University’s LLB programme. In his first two years of practice he worked in general conveyancing for a small Auckland firm. He then moved to Rotorua in 1979 practicing exclusively in litigation (criminal defence, family and general civil) at East Brewster. He has appeared in various tribunals and was appointed to the Police Disciplinary Tribunal.

In 1998, Judge Ronayne became a partner and crown prosecutor at Tauranga’s office of the Crown Solicitor, Ronayne Hollister-Jones Lellman. On a professional level, he regularly teaches litigation skills and has contributed to the District Law Society.
