Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced Diane Maxwell has been appointed to the position of Retirement Commissioner for three months.

Ms Maxwell will be seconded from the Financial Markets Authority (FMA).

“The Government is making a short term secondment to the position of Retirement Commissioner to ensure momentum is not lost as the Commission continues its important work,” says Mr Foss.

Diane Maxwell is currently head of Stakeholder management at the FMA and has a background in financial literacy from her time as Head of Brand and Corporate Affairs at BNZ.

Her previous roles have included partner at Michaelides and Bednash, London, Media Director at Saatchi and Saatchi, New Zealand, and a trans- Tasman consultant for the banking and telecommunications sector.

Ms Maxwell’s term will begin on 25 March 2013.

The process of appointing a Commissioner for a three year term is continuing.
