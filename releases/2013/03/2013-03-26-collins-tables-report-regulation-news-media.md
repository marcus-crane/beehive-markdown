Justice Minister Judith Collins has tabled in Parliament today the Law Commission’s report on regulation of the news media in the digital age.

The report, *The News Media Meets ‘New Media’: Rights, Responsibilities and Regulation in the Digital Age*, provides the Law Commission’s recommendations for updating laws regulating our media for the digital era.

The Government will examine the report’s recommendations and seek views from the media industry before formally responding to the report later this year.

“The news media plays a vital role in our democracy. It is important it operates as freely as possible, while maintaining the traditional journalistic values of accuracy and fair reporting.

“However, many of the laws governing media regulations, freedoms and protections pre-date the digital era. Nowadays, virtually anyone with a computer and an internet connection can publish and spread news and opinion,” Ms Collins says.

Meanwhile, the Government is already considering recommendations by the Law Commission to address harmful digital communications. The topic was originally part of the new media review, but Ms Collins asked the Law Commission to fast-track that work, due to concerns about cyber-bullying.

“I thank the Law Commission for its work and analysis in a topical and challenging area,” Ms Collins says.
