Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today kicked off physical work on the first of Christchurch’s highly anticipated new central city anchor projects.

Construction of the 3.2km long Avon River Precinct/Te Papa Otakaro has begun with work on the riverbank between the Antigua Boatsheds and Montreal Street.  Called Watermark, this first phase of development will be a guide to how the rest of the precinct will look.

Having turned the first sod on the River Precinct today, Mr Brownlee says it is the beginning of a vibrant new central city that will make Christchurch into one of the best small cities in the world in which to live, work and play.

“A lot of work has gone into the planning for the anchor projects since the launch of the Recovery Plan in July last year, and now we are seeing that work come to fruition.

“This River Precinct is one of the projects that will encourage people to come back into the central city, whether it be to relax and enjoy the views, or to walk or cycle along the riverbanks.

“It will also encourage businesses to develop near the river and take advantage of what will be a very attractive place to work and visit.”

The Avon River Precinct is one of the key anchor projects in the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan and responds to the wishes of the community that came through the Christchurch City Council-run *Share an Idea* consultation campaign.

Stretching from Rolleston Avenue adjacent to Christchurch Hospital in the west, to Fitzgerald Avenue beyond the Avon Loop in the east, the aim is to improve the health of the river and to make it more of a feature of the city centre.

The precinct will stretch out to about 30 metres each side of the river and will see the introduction of new plantings and walking and cycling routes.

“The Avon River Precinct will also link with more green, open space in the North and East Frames and attractions like the new family playground in the central city, and to the city’s eastern suburbs,” Mr Brownlee says.

Concept designs for the Avon River Precinct and North and East Frames are still being finalised, and community feedback will be sought on the site.  Construction of the next sections of the precinct is scheduled to start this November.
