Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says prison performance tables have been introduced for the first time to enable greater transparency and accountability to taxpayers.

All 17 prisons are now measured on their performance against each other in a range of areas including security, assaults, drug tests and rehabilitation programmes. They are then categorised in four performance grades, with the resulting tables released quarterly.

The information is used by Corrections and prison managers to identify and share successful practices, and focus on areas which need improvement.

“These first-ever performance tables are a valuable tool for Corrections, and also allow communities to measure how well our prisons are operating,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Corrections has set a very high bar, and I’m pleased that six prisons are exceeding expectations.

“I would expect some facilities will move to the “exceptional” category as time goes on, as we continue to focus on enhancing prison operations to help reach our target of a 25 per cent reduction in reoffending by 2017.

“I also expect that prisons in the “Needs Improvement” section will address the issues which have put them in that category.

“It is also worth noting that the privately-run prison at Mount Eden is in the “Exceeding” category, on a par with the best-performing public prisons, and this shows how much progress has been made by Serco.”

The performance tables, which will be updated quarterly online, can be viewed at
