Chile and New Zealand will continue to strengthen their trade and economic ties, particularly though education, agriculture and energy, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Mr Key today held bilateral talks with Chilean President Sebastian Piñera, where the two leaders discussed the on-going Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations and the warm relationship between the two countries.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Chile is our broadest in Latin America, and has been driven by increasing people-to-people links and investment in each other’s countries,” says Mr Key.

“We also collaborate on international issues and, to that end, I thank President Piñera for Chile’s support for New Zealand’s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.

“New Zealand and Chile were founding members of what has become the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations. These negotiations have now grown to include 11 economies, representing US $21 trillion in GDP and around 600 million consumers.

“The Trans Pacific Partnership has strong momentum, and it is the only agreement where negotiations span the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. President Piñera and I both underlined our commitment to concluding a high-quality, ambitious agreement by October.”

Mr Key says there is ample scope for New Zealand businesses to increase their influence and build on their investment in Chile, particularly in agriculture and renewable energy.

“Chile is developing its geothermal energy programme, and New Zealand businesses have the expertise to help make ventures commercially viable. Both President Piñera and I are also committed to seeing an exchange of people, ideas and investment in the agriculture sector.”

Mr Key says both leaders discussed continued collaboration in the Global Research Alliance, and in other environmental initiatives including the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation, whale conservation and cooperation on Antarctic issues.

“Chile and New Zealand share common views across a range of areas, and President Piñera and I reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring the dynamic partnership our countries share moves from strength to strength.”

Mr Key is leading a trade delegation to Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, and returns to New Zealand on March 15.
