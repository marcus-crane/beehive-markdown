Prime Minister John Key has today officially opened Nova Energy’s new $100 million McKee Power Plant in north Taranaki.

“This new 100MW plant is capable of providing energy to around 100,000 homes and will be a valuable asset to New Zealand’s electricity system.”

Mr Key says the development and opening of this new plant has delivered positive economic benefits for the Taranaki region.

“At the peak of the construction of this new plant, it employed around 110 people.

“The new capacity from the plant will enable Nova Energy to potentially double its number of customers, which would lead to more jobs in the company nationwide.”
