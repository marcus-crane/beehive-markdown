Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the Government is proposing to build two new schools in North-East Hamilton to help serve the growing population.

It is proposed a new $7 - $10 million primary school will open in 2015 in the Flagstaff area and the aim is for new provision for Year 7-13 students to open in 2016.

“The Government recognises that Hamilton North is one of the country’s fastest growing areas,’’ says Ms Parata.

“There are approximately 1900 primary school age students in North-East Hamilton, but that number is projected to grow to around 2500 by 2016.

“Over the last ten years two new primary schools have been built in the North-East, Rototuna Primary School and Te Totara Primary School, but with those schools at near capacity I am delighted to announce that the Government is proposing to build a new Year 1-6 primary school.

“It is also proposing to build new provision for Year 7-13 students with a view to this being open in 2016.

“These will be modern new schools with flexible learning areas, access to ultra-fast broadband, and energy efficient buildings. They will serve communities for many years to come and ensure each and every child gets a great education.’’

“The first step in this process is to undertake consultation, with neighbouring state schools whose roll might be affected by the new provision.”

A final decision about the new primary school will be made in June 2013, and the new provision for Year 7-13 students later this year.

***Notes***

Consultation for the new primary school will be held in March and April 2013 with a final decision expected in June 2013.

Consultation for the new provision for Year 7-13 students will take place in August and September 2013 with a final decision announced later in the year. It has not been decided whether the secondary provision will be an Intermediate (Year 7-8) and Year 9-13 schools or one Year 7-13 school.

Establishment boards for both schools will be set up. The establishment boards will determine each new school’s policy, governance practices and influence school design. It will also appoint the principal and staff, and work with its community to build a vision and school culture which supports learning and achievement for all its students
