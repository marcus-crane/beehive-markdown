Health Minister Tony Ryall says this government is investing $200,000 into a research project to identify more effective ways to manage childhood asthma.

“New Zealand rates of respiratory diseases are much higher than in many comparable countries,” says Mr Ryall.

“One in seven New Zealand children has been diagnosed with asthma and takes medication for the condition – this equates to over 100,000 children.

“Evidence suggests effective management of asthma early in a person’s life can significantly reduce the effects of asthma later on.

“By looking at the effectiveness of various interventions, the research will identify ways health practitioners can better support young sufferers and those at risk of developing the condition. The findings will then be used to inform best practice asthma management guidelines.

“The research will also investigate how parents and children obtain, process and understand information about asthma. This will identify how we can provide better support and information to families so they have a better understanding of what asthma is and how to best manage it.

“The 18 month research project is being led by two experienced asthma researchers from the University of Otago, Bernadette Jones and Dr Tristram Ingham.”

The research project is being jointly funded project by the Ministry of Health and the Asthma Foundation and is due to finish in June 2014.
