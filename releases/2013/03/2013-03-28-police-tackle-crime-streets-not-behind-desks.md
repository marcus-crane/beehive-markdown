Police Minister Anne Tolley says Labour needs to back our Police, rather than mislead and criticise over any operational changes they make to provide a better service to the public.

“Once again, Labour is scaremongering and trying to use our Police as a political football,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Claims that Police stations are closing are nonsense and Labour knows it.

“The Police have small offices, in addition to stations, which have varying opening hours and district commanders decide how they are used to best suit communities, but the introduction of the Crime Reporting Line means the public have much better access to the Police.

“Bricks and mortar don’t tackle or prevent crime. Cops out in our communities do that, and under the National-led Government there are more Police on the streets and they are devoting more time to crime prevention. 

“The facts are that under National, crime rates are at a thirty year low. We delivered 600 additional frontline cops, police foot patrols were up 70 per cent last year, and the rollout of new technology will deliver over half a million extra frontline Police hours every year.

“Police are working smarter and better to prevent crime before it happens, and are getting fantastic results, with crime falling in each of the last two years.

“What they don’t need is Labour undermining the Police, misleading the public, and misquoting and misrepresenting briefing papers.

“I look forward to the release of the latest crime statistics next week.”
