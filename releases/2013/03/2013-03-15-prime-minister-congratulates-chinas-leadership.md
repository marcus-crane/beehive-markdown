Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key today congratulated China's President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on the announcement of their appointments at the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing.

"Relations between New Zealand and the People's Republic of China continue to develop strongly across the board. In 2012 our countries celebrated 40 years of formal diplomatic relations, and this year we will mark 5 years since signing of the landmark New Zealand China Free Trade Agreement.

"Both President Xi and Premier Li have made invaluable personal contributions to strengthening ties between our two countries, including through high-level visits to New Zealand in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

"I have had the pleasure of meeting with both leaders on a number of previous occasions, and I look forward to offering my congratulations in person when I make an official visit to China in a few weeks", Mr Key said.
