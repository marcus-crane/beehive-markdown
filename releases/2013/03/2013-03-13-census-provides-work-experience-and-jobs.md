Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has welcomed a deal which has provided two weeks paid full-time work experience in the Census call centre.

“Work and Income and Telnet agreed on a deal to recruit 222 beneficiaries for the Census call centre, providing valuable on-the-job experience.”

“Sixteen people have already been given fulltime positions as a result,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Telnet told us they valued attitude and personality over prior work-history, which also provided opportunities to those with no previous work experience.”

Work brokers screened potential recruits and Telnet through its sister company Callcentre People, carried out interviews and induction seminars before the 222 started work at the end of February.

“More than 100 of the recruits were under 25 years old and 36 had been on the DPB or Sickness Benefits previously,” says Mrs Bennett.

“This gives them valuable work experience, a reference to take to their next interview and contacts in the workforce. And given almost all advertised jobs ask for work experience, 222 people will now be able to tick that box.”

“This is for the most part, a short-term job, but clearly worthwhile.”

Reflective of the diverse labour market, several recruits were able to provide phone support in multiple languages.

Sixty recruits will also have an extra week’s work. Between 20-30 will continue working till the end of March, with some permanent positions also available.

“Already sixteen people have secured full time positions with Telnet.”

Up to 30 places on a Skills for Industry training programme with contact centre Telelink will be available for those who complete work on the Census project. This is another opportunity for entry-level training and employment.

A separate agreement with First Security has seen 32 beneficiaries offered positions as security guards. Both deals illustrate how proactive Work and Income are when it comes to work opportunities.
