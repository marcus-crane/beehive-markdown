Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the signing of an agreement which will see more Brazilian students studying in New Zealand, following a bilateral meeting with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff today in Brasilia.

Mr Key says New Zealand’s reputation as a welcoming country with high-quality qualifications makes it a natural fit for Brazilian students.

“The Science Without Borders agreement, signed today, will help facilitate Brazilian graduate and post-graduate students to further their studies at New Zealand universities.

“Over 3,000 Brazilians study in New Zealand each year, and the agreement will help cement Brazil as one of our country’s most important export education markets,” says Mr Key.

“Brazil is Latin America’s economic powerhouse and a natural leader in the region – it presents a vast array of opportunities for New Zealand businesses. There’s real scope for New Zealanders to export their world-class agri-tech, intellectual property and services to Brazil.

“Brazil is also New Zealand’s largest Latin American tourism market, with a mix of working holiday-makers and high-end tourists visiting.

“The endorsement of a new, liberal air services agreement today between New Zealand and Brazil should encourage airlines to consider expanding air connections between the two countries – not only to capitalise on the growing tourism trade, but to facilitate the growing trade in services and investment.

“New Zealand is well placed to serve as a hub for Brazilian businesses wishing to expand their operations into the Asia-Pacific region.”

Mr Key says Brazil and New Zealand have common interests in enhancing their agricultural industries.

“The problem isn’t about the global market being big enough for food-producing nations like Brazil and New Zealand – the issue is making sure our countries can provide enough clean, safe food to keep the rest of the world fed.

“Our countries are producers of beef and dairy products, and there is plenty of scope for us to work together to enhance our exports – in forums like the WTO and also the Global Research Alliance.”

Mr Key is leading a trade delegation to Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, and returns to New Zealand on March 15.
