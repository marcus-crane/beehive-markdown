Associate Education Minister John Banks today announced the establishment and appointment of members to the independent Partnership Schools Authorisation Board.

The role of the Board is to evaluate applications for Partnership Schools and make recommendations to the Minister of Education on which applications should be considered for contract negotiations.  No final recommendations will be made by the Board until the Parliamentary process is complete. 

Once the schools are established, the Board will have a role in the regular review and monitoring of their performance to ensure agreed targets are achieved

The Board will work closely with the Ministry of Education and maintain a strong relationship with the Secretary for Education.

“I am pleased that such a high calibre and well respected group will be overseeing this exciting new education initiative,” Mr Banks said.

“The members have a wide range of experience to draw on and the work they do will ultimately help improve education outcomes for Māori and Pasifika students, those from low socio economic backgrounds and learners with special education needs. 

“The appointment of Partnership School Working Group Members, Catherine Isaac and Dr Margaret Southwick, will provide continuity and ensure a seamless transition between the Working Group and the Authorisation Board. 

 “The Board will help ensure the right organisations are appointed to run Partnership Schools and that the schools are providing excellent learning opportunities for their students and meeting their agreed achievement targets. 

“Partnership Schools will offer an alternative option for parents, bringing together the education, business and community sectors to provide opportunities for disadvantaged students to succeed.

“It is intended that the first Partnership Schools will be opened in time for the 2014 school year,” Mr Banks said.
