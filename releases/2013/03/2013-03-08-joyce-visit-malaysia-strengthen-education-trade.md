Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce leaves for Malaysia tonight on a four-day visit to showcase New Zealand’s education and trade opportunities as part of New Zealand Week in that country.

“This trip will be a great way of strengthening and extending New Zealand’s relationship with Malaysia – particularly in the areas of international education and trade,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Government wants to double the economic contribution the international education industry makes to New Zealand to $5 billion by 2025. There is great potential in the Malaysian market, which contributes about $80 million to our economy each year.

“In 2011, 50,000 Malaysian students travelled abroad to study – 2,000 of those came to New Zealand. By showcasing our tertiary education institutions and the high-quality courses they offer, we want to encourage more international students from Malaysia and Asia to come and study in New Zealand.”

Mr Joyce will also be discussing investment opportunities in Canterbury with Malaysian businesses.

“With the recovery activities in Christchurch well underway, it is important to ensure our education and business partners overseas know about the investment opportunities arising from the rebuild,” Mr Joyce says.

Over New Zealand Week, Mr Joyce will attend an education fair promoting New Zealand tertiary education institutions in Kuching, Sarawak; meet with Malaysian businesses to discuss investment opportunities in Kuala Lumpur; sign an education co-operation agreement with Malaysia’s Minister of Higher Education Mohamed Khaled Nordin; and launch a high profile gala event and fashion show.

Mr Joyce will return to New Zealand on Tuesday evening.
