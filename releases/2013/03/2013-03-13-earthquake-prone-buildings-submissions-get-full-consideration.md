Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says a late surge of submissions has taken the number lodged on earthquake-prone building proposals past 500.

The Government is seeking to introduce a consistent national approach to dealing with earthquake-prone buildings following the Canterbury earthquakes.

Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment proposals, which were out for three months of consultation, would require all buildings to be assessed within five years and, if earthquake-prone, to be strengthened or demolished within 10 years of assessment.

“The Ministry have received 529 submissions. This includes 368 from individuals and 161 from organisations like councils, representatives of engineers, property owners, insurers, people with disabilities, and heritage building interests.”

The volume of responses and complexity of issues raised in the consultation means that plenty of time will be needed to properly consider the feedback.

“We had hoped to make policy decisions by the middle of the year, but we will take longer if necessary to get this right. I have stressed throughout the consultation period that these proposals are just a starting-point and some changes are likely,” Mr Williamson says.

“A summary of submissions will be released after the Cabinet announces policy changes.
