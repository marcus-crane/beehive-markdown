New catch limits for rock lobster (crayfish), scallops and surf clams will boost exports and increase sustainability, says Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy.

“The new catch limits will take effect from 1 April and are based on the best available scientific information, as well as submissions received from tangata whenua and fishery stakeholders,” says Mr Guy.

“MPI and the fishing industry estimate the commercial catch limit increases have the potential to create a new industry for surf clams that could add up to $20 million a year in export earnings. Increases for rock lobster will also generate over $3 million a year in exports.

“These economic opportunities and new jobs will benefit many regional communities, including Hawkes Bay, Gisborne, Taranaki and Coromandel.”

The changes for 1 April are:

- A 32.2 tonne increase to the commercial catch limit for the Gisborne rock lobster fishery;
- A 32.8 tonne increase to the commercial catch limit for the Wellington/Hawkes Bay rock lobster fishery
- A total commercial catch limit increase of 2718 tonnes for four species of surf clam in the Central (Egmont) fishery;
- A 78 tonne increase to the commercial limit in the Coromandel scallop fishery.
- A 19.9 tonne decrease to the commercial limit in the Otago rock lobster fishery.

“There has been broad consultation and involvement with commercial, iwi and recreational stakeholders.

“Importantly, the decrease in Otago rock lobster take will ensure long term sustainability of the fishery.

“Catch limit increases are based on new scientific information showing that large numbers of surf clams along the Manawatu coast, and large numbers of decent-sized scallops in the Hauraki Gulf, are available for sustainable harvest.”

Allowances for Maori customary fishing and recreational interests remain unchanged for rock lobster, but have increased in some cases for surf clams and scallops.
