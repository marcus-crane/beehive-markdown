Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the strong private sector presence when Pacific leaders, international donors and energy experts meet in Auckland for the two-day Pacific Energy Summit next week. Over 100 local and international companies will participate.

The Summit, announced by Mr McCully yesterday, will take place from 25 to 26 March at the Viaduct Events Centre. Co-hosted with the European Union, it aims to connect Pacific countries with major donors to boost investment in renewable energy projects in the region.

 “An Energy Showcase running alongside the Summit will feature 80 exhibitors, providing a vehicle for countries, donors and the private sector to display the best, newest and most innovative projects, services or technology in renewable energy sector,” Mr McCully says.

Showcase exhibitors will present a variety of renewable energy technology from solar panels to wind turbines, geothermal, tidal and biomass, alongside innovations in energy efficiency and the professional engineering, infrastructure and consultancy services required to deliver them.  More than a dozen Pacific Island countries and territories will also have booths where they can present their future plans as well as projects that are already under way.

“Many renewable energy project opportunities promoted at the Summit by Pacific countries will be attractive to private sector investment and independent power producers.

“New Zealand businesses are among the best in the world as solution providers for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. These companies have the capability and experience required to take forward commitments made by the donor community at the Summit,” Mr McCully says.
