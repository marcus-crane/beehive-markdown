Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of Amanda Ellis as Permanent Representative to the Office of the United Nations in Geneva.

“I am delighted Ms Ellis is going to lead New Zealand’s team in Geneva to further enhance our relationship with the UN and other specialised agencies based there.  She will be looking to leverage New Zealand’s reputation and influence in those bodies in support of the Security Council campaign,” Mr McCully says.

“Ms Ellis will have an additional role as a Special Envoy to La Francophonie and will look to deepen New Zealand’s understanding of that important group of countries.”

Ms Ellis has a background in finance, working in senior roles in organisations including the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.  Her current role is Deputy Secretary, International Development Group (IDG) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Head of the New Zealand Aid Programme.

While she is on this two-year secondment, Craig Hawke, an experienced senior IDG manager, will be Deputy Secretary, International Development Group.
