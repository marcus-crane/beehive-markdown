Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the next stage of debate on welfare reform amidst continued public support for it.

“But what astounds me is the emotive rhetoric, misinformation and scaremongering from those who fail to see beyond benefit dependency.”

The Council of Trade Unions today argues we’re in a time of “unprecedented high unemployment” so shouldn’t attempt to improve the welfare system.

The most recent figures show there are 53,747 people on Unemployment Benefits. In 1999 Unemployment Benefits numbered more than 161,000.

“Let’s get real, this isn’t the worst this country has ever seen but it could be better, which is why we’re focused on getting people into work.”

“The CTU state we’re simply pushing people into low-skilled jobs, this just sounds elitist; they think there are worthy and non-worthy jobs, but what does that say to people who are working hard?”

The CTU thinks expectations of work will fail. But work expectations for sole parents were already changed in 2010, with a new part-time expectation introduced for those with children over six years old.

“The sky hasn’t fallen in and increasing numbers of sole parents are in part time work,” says Mrs Bennett.

“All we’re asking is for people to be available for and actively looking for work and if they genuinely can’t get a job, their benefit won’t be cut.”

“The CTU and Jacinda Ardern need to get their lines straight, the CTU want us to leave people on benefits, Ms Ardern thinks there’s been too many and would rather we didn’t support all those who need it.”

The Social Security (Benefit Categories and Work Focus) Amendment Bill, representing the third stage of reform, is set down for Committee of the Whole House today.
