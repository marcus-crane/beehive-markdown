At as 3 pm today, over 422,000 New Zealanders have pre-registered for Mighty River Power shares," State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall says.

"New Zealanders intending to pre-register their interest in buying Mighty River Power shares but haven't yet done so have until tomorrow afternoon to do so", says Mr Ryall.

**The pre-registration deadline is 5pm on Friday 22 March.**

New Zealanders can pre-register online or via the Share Offer call centre at

- Website - [www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz](https://%3Ewww.mightyrivershares.govt.nz)
- Freecall – 0800 90 30 90 (closes 5pm Friday)

"Pre-registering is only for New Zealanders and those who pre-register may get a share allocation benefit of up to 25 per cent more shares than those who do not pre-register (in the event of oversubscription)."

"But it does not commit anyone to having to buy the shares. It does however allow us to keep people informed," Mr Ryall says.

"The website has a Frequently Asked Questions section which will be very helpful for new investors and for people who haven't participated in a Share Offer before."

"There is also the www.governmentshareoffers.govt.nz website that has information on the Mixed Ownership Model programme, as well as information about share ownership."
