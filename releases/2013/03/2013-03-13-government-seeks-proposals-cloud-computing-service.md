Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has announced that the Department of Internal Affairs is seeking proposals for an all-of-Government Desktop as a Service (DaaS) contract.

“Desktop as a Service will make government workplaces more flexible by enabling people to access their own desktop from different locations, rather than being tied to their own computer. The service would make it possible to access the same desktop and applications from different PCs, or from a laptop or tablet,” says Mr Tremain.

“It also improves security by storing data centrally rather than on individual devices, and will enable standardised services across government.

“Four government agencies have indicated they want to use the service as soon as it becomes available, and a further nine intend to implement it over the next two years.

“Desktop as a Service is a cloud-based service and part of the Government’s wider cloud computing programme. Cloud technology is revolutionising the way we think about ICT and will improve collaboration, efficiency and cost savings across government.”

The Department of Internal Affairs Request for Proposal can be accessed on the Government Electronic Tendering service:
