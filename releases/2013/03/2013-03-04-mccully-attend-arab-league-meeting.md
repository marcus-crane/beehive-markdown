Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Egypt today to attend the League of Arab States Executive Council meeting.

“The Arab League has been at the forefront of some of the most pressing international issues over the past two years, including Libya and Syria,” Mr McCully says.

“Its leadership will be critical for dealing with the range of challenges that have resulted from the Arab Spring. This visit provides an opportunity for New Zealand to strengthen its relationship with a vitally important regional organisation.”

Mr McCully will also visit Middle East countries including Bahrain, Turkey and Jordan for official talks.

“I am looking forward to discussing New Zealand’s bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council with my counterparts in the region,” Mr McCully says.

Other topics of discussion include ongoing regional security issues, and New Zealand’s humanitarian assistance for Syrian refugees in Turkey and Jordan.
