Police Minister Anne Tolley has today praised frontline officers at the Counties Manukau Police pay parade and awards ceremony.

Officers were awarded certificates of commendation, as well as long service and good conduct medals, following a parade of 180 staff through the streets of Manukau. Members of the public were also recognised for their efforts in helping prevent crime.

“It was great to see our frontline officers marching through the streets of the community which they serve so well,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It was an honour to present staff with awards to acknowledge long service, good conduct, bravery and dedication to duty.

“They thoroughly deserve to be recognised, as do their families for their ongoing support.

“The crime rate in Counties Manukau fell by over 11 per cent in the last fiscal year, equating to almost 5,000 fewer crimes and thousands fewer victims of crime.

“Foot patrols increased by 26 per cent in Manukau last year, in a district which has been taking the lead in crime prevention.

“The upcoming rollout of smartphones and tablets to staff will free up over 72,000 additional frontline hours to be reinvested in more visible frontline preventative work in the district, and this is on top of the 300 extra officers delivered by the National-led Government in Manukau.

“I was able to thank Police staff for their professionalism and dedication to duty, and let them know that the Government and the public appreciates all of their efforts in making our communities safe.”
