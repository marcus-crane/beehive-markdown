Environment Minister Amy Adams is disappointed but not surprised that environment groups have resorted to scaremongering over proposed changes aimed at strengthening the Resource Management Act.

Contrary to claims, core environmental protections have been maintained in the Resource Management Act, and will, in many cases, be strengthened by the Government’s proposals.

"Where clauses have been proposed for deletion from the existing purpose sections of the Act, this is only where independent and recognised experts have identified them as unnecessary duplication that is already provided for through other parts of the Act. This is made very clear in the discussion document.

“I would have expected Labour, the Greens and environmental groups to have a better understanding of the RMA, so I can only assume they are intentionally trying to mislead.

“The simple fact is the RMA has become cumbersome, uncertain and highly litigious. If these groups cannot understand this, then they are out of touch with everyday New Zealanders.

“The RMA, as well as being environmental legislation, is also our primary planning framework, and in that regard, it is not delivering in a way that meets the needs of New Zealanders.

“These groups need to get out of the office and talk to communities and businesses. They will tell them what they have told me – they are facing years and years of uncertainty while decisions are made whether a project can or cannot proceed.

“In most cases, it is not about whether a particular project can or cannot proceed, it is about the time and cost to reach that decision.

“The money spent on having to fight to get ahead or defend a position, is money that our households and businesses are missing out on.

“Environment groups seem determined to oppose change. Only recently, a coalition including Forest and Bird, the Environmental Defence Society and Ecologic wrote to me warning that the Environment Court was not equipped to make substantial value judgements – and yet they now oppose proposals aimed at tackling this very issue.

“Do these groups really think that the ability of someone to get a consent faster to build their house, or extend their deck is an assault on the environment?

“I was appalled to hear yesterday that the horticulture industry has spent $30 million dollars in RMA compliance costs over the past 12 months. That simply cannot continue, and reinforces why the Government’s proposals are badly needed.”

Ms Adams also dismissed claims that the proposals unreasonably interfere with local decision-making.

“Councils have been let down by successive governments taking a hands-off approach to major issues for far too long. It has been hugely unfair on councils and it is now time for the Government to step-up and offer more support. New Zealanders are looking to central government to show strong leadership.”
