Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced that a national programme to encourage the recycling of unwanted televisions and raise investment in New Zealand’s electronic recycling capacity will be launched in the South Island tomorrow.

The TV TakeBack programme aims to divert televisions from going to landfill in an initiative that involves the Government partnering with a range of recyclers, councils and retailers to provide a nationwide network of subsidised options.

“As we go digital, my challenge to New Zealanders is to play their part in caring for the environment,” Ms Adams says.

“Televisions contain materials such as lead and mercury that can be harmful if released into soil or waterways, so they should not be being dumped in landfills.

“If people are cleaning out the garage and want to get rid of an unwanted television, it is best to dispose of it responsibly.”

The recycling programme, which coincides with New Zealand’s switch from analogue to digital television, starts in the South Island tomorrow.

The programme will then be rolled out to the lower North Island and Auckland by July, and the rest of the North Island from September, to coincide with the digital switchover in each region.

During the first stage of the programme, more than 20,000 televisions were dropped off for recycling in Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast – the first two regions to go digital.

“Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast have set the standard for the rest of the country.

“The willingness of residents in these regions to recycle their televisions means hundreds of tonnes of waste will now be recycled and re-used in other products, rather than go to landfill.”

The programme also aims to improve recycling infrastructure, raise public awareness, and investigate options for the long-term management of electronic waste.

Increasing recycling infrastructure will ensure recyclers have the capacity and capability to deal with increased volumes of televisions.

Through a Government subsidy, the cost to the public to recycle a television will be no more than $5.

Residents in each region will be advised of the various recycling options via local promotional campaigns and online.

Televisions dropped off for recycling will be taken to national recycling facilities to be taken apart. Components are recycled locally or sent to specialist facilities overseas.

The recycled material has a variety of uses. For example, glass from a television screen can be transformed into bunker sand for golf courses or used in roading aggregate.

The initiative is backed by the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund.  The fund provides financial support to projects which increase resource efficiency and decrease the amount of waste going to landfill. Money for the fund comes from a waste levy charged on waste disposed of at landfills.

To date, the Government has allocated $43 million in funding for 82 projects through the fund.

**TV TakeBack Q and A:**

**What is TV TakeBack?**

The TV TakeBack programme aims to divert televisions from going to landfill in an initiative that involves the Government partnering with a range of recyclers and retailers to provide a nationwide network of subsidised options.

The initiative is backed by the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund. The programme is also designed to encourage the recycling of televisions and increase investment in New Zealand’s recycling capacity.

**When is TV TakeBack coming to each region?**

The TV TakeBack programme coincides with New Zealand’s switch from analogue to digital television (Going Digital).  TV TakeBack starts in the South Island on 25 March. It will be available in the lower North Island and Auckland by July this year, and the rest of the North Island from September.

The first phase of TV TakeBack started in October last year in Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast - the first two regions to go digital. More than 20,000 televisions were collected for recycling.

**Where can I take my television to be recycled?**

A list of drop off points in TV TakeBack regions is available at [www.tvtakeback.govt.nz/where-can-i-recycle](http://www.tvtakeback.govt.nz/where-can-i-recycle)

**Why is it important to recycle unwanted televisions?**

Televisions contain materials like lead that are hazardous to the environment and health so they shouldn’t be dumped in landfills or into the environment, but recycled responsibly. Recycling also reduces waste going to landfill.

Televisions contain many materials which can be recycled into other products, such as copper, metals and glass.

**What happens when a television is dropped off to be recycled?**

Televisions are taken to national recycling facilities, where they are taken apart and the components (such as copper and steel) are recycled locally or safely exported overseas to be recycled.

**Where do the components from unwanted televisions end up?**

·         Metals such as steel are melted down and made into new products such as construction material

·         Copper wire is removed and recycled in New Zealand

·         Circuit boards are recycled overseas

·         Aluminium is removed and recycled in New Zealand

·         Copper around the electron gun can be recycled into new products

·         Degaussing wire that sits around the front of the screen is high grade iron that can be recycled into metal goods, such as nails, nuts and bolts

**Why is there a charge for taking a television to be recycled?**

Although many components from an old television can be recycled, the value of the material that can be recovered is currently less than the cost of transport and recycling.

**Is TV TakeBack just about televisions?**

This programme provides money to reduce public charges for recycling, to improve recycling infrastructure and raise public awareness.

Increasing recycling infrastructure will ensure recyclers have capacity and capability to deal with increased volumes of televisions. The Government is also investigating options for the long term management of electronic waste.

**How can I be sure TV TakeBack will recycle old televisions responsibly?**

All participating recyclers must follow the Ministry for the Environment’s guidelines for collecting and recycling e-waste, or the Australian-New Zealand Standard for collection, storage, transport and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment.

Recyclers must report on where all collected materials have gone. The Ministry for the Environment will be doing audits to make sure these are being followed correctly.

All participating recyclers will be required to obtain the necessary consents to ensure they follow proper procedures when they export e-waste.
