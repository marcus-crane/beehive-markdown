Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse today turned the first sod to begin construction on the 4.8km Rangiriri section of the Waikato Expressway.

"This is a project that will improve safety and travel times for motorists between the Waikato, Auckland and Bay of Plenty, while helping preserve the cultural heritage of the area,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The project will see the restoration of the historic Rangiriri Pa site and battle trench, site of the pivotal 1863 battle of Rangiriri. It will also recognise Paetai, the site associated with the crowning of the first Maori King.

“The Waikato is strategically placed within the economic ‘golden triangle’ of Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga, and the completed Expressway will improve transport connections between these key cities.”

“Easing traffic congestion is essential to unlocking New Zealand’s economic potential. The investment we’re making here is one which will deliver positive returns to all New Zealanders, now and for generations to come.”

He says the Government with the help of the NZTA is aiming to have the entire Expressway completed by 2019.

“This is another example of the Government's focus on ensuring New Zealand has the infrastructure it needs for a strong and growing economy, now and in the future,” says Mr Woodhouse.
