A payment of nearly $31 million for civil defence emergency response costs related to the Canterbury earthquakes has been paid to the Christchurch City Council, Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says.

This payment brings the total Government contribution paid to the Christchurch City Council to more than $208 million in response to the September 2010 and February, June and December 2011 earthquakes.

“Each council has the initial responsibility for a civil defence response in its area. I would like to acknowledge the important and significant work that has been done in this regard by the councils in Canterbury and thank all the individuals involved,” Ms Kaye says.

“The financial assistance for the response period pays for essential civil defence costs incurred in accommodating, transporting, feeding and clothing displaced people, and for essential infrastructure repair, and other response costs, such as the rapid supply of chemical toilets and portaloos.

“Canterbury has had a tough two and a half years and Civil Defence Emergency Management has played a significant role in earthquake response,” Ms Kaye says. “The focus is now on the important rebuilding that is underway. So finalising the response-related issues is an important step forward.

“The Government remains absolutely committed to rebuilding Canterbury.”

In a significant natural disaster emergency, central government supports the local authority with direct financial assistance to the council. The aim is to cover the response costs and allow the community to focus on recovery, as quickly as possible.

The Government has one outstanding civil defence claim for the earthquake response period to consider. Any costs incurred by territorial authorities after 30 June 2012 relating to the recovery and rebuild of Christchurch will be dealt with by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA).
