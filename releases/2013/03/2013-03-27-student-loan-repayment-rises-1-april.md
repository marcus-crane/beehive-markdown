The student loan repayment rate for borrowers living in New Zealand will rise to 12 per cent from next Monday, as announced in Budget 2012.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says increasing the repayment rate from 10 cents to 12 cents for each dollar of income from 1 April means graduates and ex-students will pay their loans off more quickly.

“Increasing the repayment rate will increase the rate at which people pay of their loans and provides savings of $184.2 million over four years that the Government is investing into the next generation of students,” Mr Joyce says.

“Since we have been in Government we have reduced the cost of lending under the Student Loan Scheme from 48 cents in every dollar to 37 cents. We are looking to bring that cost down further over time.

“Increasing the repayment rate is also assisting the Government to reduce the cost of the scheme for taxpayers at a time of significant fiscal pressure.”

Borrowers will repay the same amount in total but the median repayment time will decrease by approximately four months.

The change is income dependant and will not impact people who receive income-tested benefits. Borrowers who are unable to meet their obligations due to financial hardship may apply for relief under hardship provisions. Only borrowers with income over the repayment threshold (currently $367 a week or $19,084 annually) will be affected.

In a related change to the Student Loan Scheme, the Voluntary Repayment Bonus will no longer be available from 1 April.

“The Voluntary Repayment Bonus is being cancelled because it is has not created the increase in on-going repayments we were hoping for nor improved the value of the Student Loan Scheme. This will provide savings of around $43.5 million over the next four years which is also being reinvested into tertiary education,” Mr Joyce says.

“Many borrowers who were already paying back their loans quickly were also claiming the bonus. The bonus was also encouraging some students to borrow, when they did not need to do so. In 2011 the 2,611 borrowers who repaid their student loans in the same year they borrowed, received $1.8 million in bonuses, from approximately $13 million of annual bonus payments. This resulted in a cost to taxpayers.

“The Government remains committed to interest-free student loans but it is important the Student Loan Scheme is affordable for students and taxpayers and sustainable for the country.”
