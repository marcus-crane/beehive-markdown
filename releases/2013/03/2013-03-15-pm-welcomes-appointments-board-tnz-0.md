Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has today announced one new appointment and one reappointment to the board of Tourism New Zealand (TNZ).

“I would like to thank the departing member, John Barrett, who has served TNZ well during his term.

“I would also like to welcome Jamie Tuuta whose appointment became official last week. Jamie is from Ngāti Mutunga, Te Atiawa, Ngāti Tama, Ngāti Maru and Taranaki Iwi.

“Jamie brings particular expertise in governance through his wide experience in the health, iwi development, fishing, agribusiness, education and investment sectors.” says Mr Key.

Jamie Tuuta currently holds the role of the Maori Trustee. He is also a member of the Government's PEAK Group for Sustainable Land Management and the Investment Advisory Panel for the Primary Growth Partnership.

Reappointed for a second term is Richard Leggat, who is currently a member of Education New Zealand and New Zealand Post, as well as Chair of the New Zealand Cycle Trail Establishment Board and Bike NZ.

“I would like to thank both the incoming and outgoing members for their commitment to TNZ, which ensures we are effectively marketed as a visitor destination to maximise long-term benefits to New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

Mr Tuuta has been appointed for three years, effective 7 March 2013, and Mr Leggat is reappointed until 1 February 2016.
