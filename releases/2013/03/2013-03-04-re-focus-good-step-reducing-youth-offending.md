An intensive five-year programme to tackle youth offending and help disadvantaged young people in Christchurch will have a major impact on helping young offenders, says Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows.

“The Canterbury Youth Development Programme (CYDP) is a wonderful example of a community standing up to help their young people who are getting into trouble. The Re-Focus Programme will build on the experience and dedication they have, in an effort to put these kids back on the right track,” says Mr Borrows.

Re-focus will work with 160 young people aged 10-14 and their families. Government and community agencies will work collaboratively to provide intensive, long-term support which will target the drivers of crime in families such as domestic violence, substance abuse, truancy and inter-generational benefit dependency.

“The work done by the Re-Focus Programme will complement other Government and community initiatives to support young people in trouble. This includes our Fresh Start youth justice reforms, the Children’s Action Plan being led by Social Development Minister Paula Bennett, and the Youth Crime Action Plan currently under development.

“The common theme running through all these initiatives is the need for communities – as well as Government – to take responsibility for giving our young people the best possible start to life, and helping them back onto the right path when they stray. Re-Focus will be an admirable addition to these efforts.”

Individual families will be referred to the programme by Police, Child, Youth and Family, schools and other community agencies.

‘’This programme draws together government agencies, NGOs and the community to help these troubled kids and their families. It’s an exciting initiative and I know CYDP is passionate about working with young people,’’ says Mr Borrows.

“I wish them all the very best, and look forward to seeing what we can learn from Re-Focus.”
