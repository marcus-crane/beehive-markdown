A newly appointed consortium has this week begun planning Christchurch’s world-class Health Precinct, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has announced.

The consortium led by companies BVN Donovan Hill and Jasmax has been selected from a group of 12 consortia that tendered to master plan the new hub for health education, research and innovation and delivery of health services to the public.

The Health Precinct is one of the key anchor projects in the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, and has the Christchurch Central Development Unit (CCDU) working alongside partners including the Canterbury District Health Board, Otago and Canterbury universities, the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology and the private sector.

Within walking distance of Christchurch Hospital, the precinct will bring together private research and professional partners, and medi-hotels, where patients and families can stay while receiving outpatient or specialist care.

It will also provide cutting edge facilities for learning and teaching medicine involving leading tertiary providers.

Mr Brownlee says it is an exciting milestone to start work on what the precinct will look like.

“This precinct is going to provide Christchurch with the very best of health education and research facilities, and new health services, which will have huge benefits for the city and New Zealand.

“The Health Precinct will be a drawcard for talented people from Christchurch and beyond who want to work and study in the health fields.

“We can look forward to seeing some of our best young minds flourishing in future in this new precinct,” Mr Brownlee says.

The health sector is a major contributor to the national economy, with Crown spending on health representing about 7 per cent of GDP. Christchurch’s Health Precinct is expected to generate substantial new opportunities for employment and research that have far-reaching impacts.

By May the precinct master plan for the will be complete and this will determine the development options available. Detailed design will begin around August, and construction should begin in early 2014.

The master planning consortium announced today also includes the firms Studio Nield, M.A. International, Aurecon, Impact Group and Rider Levett Bucknall. It brings a wealth of collective experience in large-scale health and education developments throughout Australasia.
