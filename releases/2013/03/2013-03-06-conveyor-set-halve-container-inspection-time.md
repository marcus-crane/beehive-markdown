Customs Minister Maurice Williamson announced today that in a world first for a Customs service, New Zealand Customs has deployed a state-of-the-art mobile, telescopic conveyor system that is expected to halve inspection time for sea cargo containers.

The mobile and extendable system includes integrated x-ray, scales and flexible link conveyors, and it can be moved on the back of a truck. It is based at Customs’ sea cargo inspection facility at Ports of Auckland.

Most of the country’s imports arrive through sea cargo to Auckland, with more than 210,000 containers recorded last year.

“Customs supports the economy by keeping legitimate goods moving across the border. This important investment benefits the growing sea cargo industry by increasing the speed at which Customs clears containers.

“Given the volume, Customs must also be well equipped to identify the small percentage of illicit drugs and goods concealed in containers. This conveyor system further improves Customs’ enforcement capabilities.

“The technology is also projected to save Customs $2.2 million in labour costs over ten years,” Mr Williamson says.

Customs uses its intelligence and tools to screen 100% of containers for risk. This sees between half and one per cent of containers being closely inspected.

The conveyor system was purchased from local company Rotech Equipment for $520,000.
