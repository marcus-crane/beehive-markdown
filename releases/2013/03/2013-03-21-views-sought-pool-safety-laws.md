Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson is encouraging people to have their say on the law that protects young children from drowning in home swimming pools.

A consultation document released today on the Fencing of Swimming Pools Act will be open to submissions for seven weeks. Removing vague and inconsistent rules, improving national consistency and maintaining child safety are the aims of the document.

Drownings of young children in home pools have reduced from an average of 10 per year in 1987 to an average of three a year now.

“Everyone, no matter what side of the debate they’re on, wants to reduce the number of drownings in home pools and make them a rarity.

“It’s time to review the Act to see if we can achieve our goals while also reducing compliance costs.

“For many the rules have been very frustrating, as people have had to try and satisfy the absolute letter of the law as opposed to focusing on the intent of trying to save lives,” Mr Williamson says.

You can read the consultation document and make submissions at [www.dbh.govt.nz/consultingon-pools](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/consultingon-pools) Submissions close on May 10th.
