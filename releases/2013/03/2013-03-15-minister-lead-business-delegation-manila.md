Commerce Minister Craig Foss will be leading a delegation of New Zealand businesses to the Asia Development Bank (ADB) in the Philippines next week.

Mr Foss will be accompanied by 16 New Zealand companies, as part of the first New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) trade mission to the ADB Business Opportunities Fair.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for Kiwi companies exploring opportunities in the Asia and the Pacific. The ADB Business Opportunities Fair is a one-stop education and networking forum for consultants, manufacturers and suppliers keen to do business under ADB projects,” says Mr Foss.

The ADB Business Opportunities Fair runs from 20 – 21 March 2013.

During his visit to Manila, Mr Foss will also meet with the Philippines’ Trade and Finance Secretaries to discuss potential trade and business opportunities for Kiwi companies.

Mr Foss’ trip follows a visit from the Philippines President Benigno Aquino III to New Zealand last year.

“It is my pleasure to be leading a business delegation to the ADB and also to build on our strong relationship with the Philippines,” says Mr Foss.

“The Philippines’ economy is growing strongly, and President Aquino’s administration is making progress to improve the business environment. Our ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement offers opportunities for increasing two-way trade.”
