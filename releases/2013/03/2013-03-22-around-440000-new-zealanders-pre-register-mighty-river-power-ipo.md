The pre-registration period for the Mighty River Power Offer closed at 5pm today, with around 440,000 New Zealanders registering their interest.

Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Tony Ryall said that the number of New Zealanders who pre-registered was extremely pleasing.

"Pre-registration is not a commitment to buy shares, and someone pre-registering their interest may decide to not apply for shares in Mighty River Power. However, it was a goal of the Government to achieve widespread awareness of the opportunity, and I believe we have achieved this."

Pre-registrants who provided an email address would have received an email confirming their pre-registration number, and will be contacted next week regarding next steps.

Mr Ryall noted that New Zealanders who have not pre-registered can still take part in the Share Offer when it opens.
