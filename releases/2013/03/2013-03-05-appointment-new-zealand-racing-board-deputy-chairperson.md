Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced that Alistair Ryan has been appointed as Deputy Chairperson of the New Zealand Racing Board.

“Mr Ryan is currently a member of the New Zealand Racing Board and his appointment helps maintain stable governance,” says Mr Guy.

“In addition to his corporate governance expertise, Mr Ryan has strong finance and managerial experience.”

Mr Ryan’s appointment as Deputy Chairperson follows the High Court decision quashing the 2012 appointment of Dr Alan Jackson as independent Chairperson of the NZRB.

“After careful review, I have accepted the criteria set out in Justice Mallon’s legal decision and will not be seeking an appeal.

“A process to appoint a new independent Chairperson is getting underway, and a call for nominations will be issued shortly.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr Jackson. Alan brought extensive business and governance experience to bear in his role as Chairperson, and had already made significant progress on the NZRB’s strategic priorities. I greatly appreciate his commitment to the role, and thank him for his hard work.”

Alistair Ryan has served as a member of the NZRB since August 2012. His NZRB membership term concludes in July 2015.
