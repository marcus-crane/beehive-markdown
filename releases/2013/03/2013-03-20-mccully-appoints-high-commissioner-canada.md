Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of Simon Tucker as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Canada.

“As Commonwealth countries, New Zealand and Canada have shared a close relationship for many years,” Mr McCully says.

“And now, as partners in the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations, we are working together on an ambitious, comprehensive agreement that will further integrate our economies in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Mr Tucker previously served at New Zealand embassies in Washington and Tehran. Most recently he held the position of General Manager for Policy Advocacy at DairyNZ, the industry body for New Zealand’s dairy farmers.

As High Commissioner to Canada, Mr Tucker will also be accredited to Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
