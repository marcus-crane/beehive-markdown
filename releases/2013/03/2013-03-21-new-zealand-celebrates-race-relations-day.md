Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins says this year’s Race Relations Day gives all New Zealanders opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate our nation’s ethnic diversity.

“The theme for Race Relations Day 2013 is ‘My Dream for Aotearoa’,” Ms Collins says.

“I want a New Zealand where every citizen is respected, valued and treated fairly. Regardless of a person’s race, colour or ethnic background, every New Zealander deserves a fair go.”

Race Relations Day is New Zealand’s equivalent of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, commemorating the Sharpeville massacre in South Africa in 1960.

In 1968 the United Nations dedicated the anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre to achieving the goals of the Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).

Ms Collins says New Zealand’s commitment to the Convention mirrors the natural desire in every New Zealander to see that everyone is given a fair go.

“New Zealand values diversity and prides itself on being an inclusive society.

“Earlier this year I presented New Zealand’s report on our progress at tackling racial discrimination and inequality to CERD in Geneva.

“I’m pleased to say the Committee noted our efforts represented many examples of best practice globally to which many nations aspire.

“Today we celebrate New Zealand’s diversity, reaffirm our commitment to harnessing the potential of all our ethnic Kiwis and acknowledge the positive contribution they make to the best little country in the world.”
