Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says New Zealanders can be proud of the contribution made by our men and women to the bush fire efforts in North Eastern Victoria.

Mr Tremain has just visited the team of 66 New Zealand fire fighters who have been battling bush fires in the Ovens and Bright mountain areas for the past two weeks.

“The experience gained by our teams will be invaluable in campaign fires back in New Zealand. They have been working in extreme conditions. The steep mountain slopes in high wind and heat make fire fighting hugely challenging,” says Mr Tremain.

“I met with Deputy Victorian Premier Hon Peter Ryan who was highly complimentary of our fire fighters efforts. He wanted to convey his thanks to all New Zealanders. The interoperability of our team and our high work ethic means that we are first to call on when extra help is required.

“Our Victorian neighbours were some of the first to put USAR teams into Christchurch and had 300 police officers on the CBD cordon without hesitation. We were hugely grateful for this support, so it’s great to be able to return the favour when our ANZAC counterparts are dealing deal with a natural disaster.

“I have nothing but praise for our deployment of fire fighters who have done our nation proud.”
