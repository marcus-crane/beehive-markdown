Environment Minister Amy Adams and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy will this week begin a series of meetings throughout the country with councils, iwi, environment groups, businesses and the public to discuss proposed changes to the resource management system.

The Government has announced proposals aimed at strengthening the Resource Management Act (RMA), and improving water quality and the way freshwater is managed.

Proposed changes to the RMA would make the system easier to use, increase certainty and predictability, attract investment, reduce unnecessary duplication and cost, whilst continuing to protect the environment.

The freshwater proposals outline a plan of action for the most comprehensive and positive reform of New Zealand’s freshwater management system for a generation. The proposals are consistent with and based on the Land and Water Forum’s recommended approach and gives effect to their core recommendations.

Meetings will be held in Greymouth, Wellington, Gisborne, Rotorua, Invercargill, Whangarei, Tauranga, Hawke’s Bay, Queenstown, Taupō, Palmerston North, Whanganui, Hamilton, Christchurch, New Plymouth, Auckland and Nelson.

“The meetings are a good opportunity for people to hear the reforms explained in more detail, and to ask any questions they might have,” Ms Adams says.

“I want to stress that these are proposals, and it is important to know what each community thinks about the Government’s reforms. The feedback received will help shape the reforms.”
