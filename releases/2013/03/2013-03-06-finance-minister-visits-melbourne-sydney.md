Finance Minister Bill English is visiting Australia today and tomorrow, where he will speak to high-level business audiences in Melbourne and Sydney, as part of his regular programme of trans-Tasman engagement.

He will also meet a number of Australian chief executives and senior business figures.

“As our largest trading partner, taking nearly a quarter of our total exports, the Australian economy is vitally important to New Zealand,” Mr English says.

“I have noted an increased interest in New Zealand and its economy among Australian businesses.

“They are particularly interested in our approach to helping give businesses here the confidence to invest, grow and employ more people, as the basis for building a more competitive and productive economy.

“Therefore, I’m keen to continue my positive dialogue with them.”

While in Melbourne today, Mr English will speak to a CEO forum. He will address a similar audience in Sydney tomorrow.

He returns to New Zealand tomorrow night.
