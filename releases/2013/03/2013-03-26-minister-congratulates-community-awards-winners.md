Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today congratulated Kaibosh on winning the supreme award at the TrustPower National Community Awards and Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust for receiving the runner-up award.

“Volunteers are vital to New Zealand, with 1.2 million volunteers contributing 270 million volunteer hours a year. But it is not just this direct effort than needs to be recognised. Volunteering builds social capital and therefore community strength and resilience.

“During the final judging for these Awards the judges heard about many extraordinary groups, all examples of combined efforts with great results. Each represents something their community is and can be proud of. Each has built social capital in their community.

“Celebrating what those 1.2 million volunteers do, alongside the people paid to guide and assist them, also builds the wider social capital that stands a community in such good stead when times get tough or tragedy strikes.

“I also acknowledge TrustPower for their continued support of these awards. As well as volunteers themselves, volunteer managers, community leaders, funders and corporate supporters all have an important role to play in determining the strength of our communities.”

**Background**

Kaibosh is New Zealand’s first dedicated food rescue organisation that is bridging the gap between businesses that are willing to donate surplus and the charities that need it in central Wellington.

Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust is a group of volunteers who are preserving their local heritage while sparking the local economy by attracting more tourists.
