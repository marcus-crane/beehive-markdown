Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson today paid tribute to the life of author Barbara Anderson, who passed away yesterday aged 86.

“Barbara Anderson was one of our finest writers, and also one of the most inspiring, becoming an internationally successful author in her sixties,” Mr Finlayson said. “After completing Bill Manhire’s creative writing degree at Victoria University, she went on to write acclaimed short stories, novels, and autobiography.”

“In 2011 she received the Arts Foundation’s Icon Award, its highest honour recognising senior artists for their lifetime’s work, following the award of an honorary doctorate by Otago University in 2008.

“She made a significant contribution to New Zealand literary culture and to Wellington’s writing community, and will be greatly missed.”

“I offer my condolences to her family and friends.”
