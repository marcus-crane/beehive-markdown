An Arrangement on Higher Education Co-operation has been jointly signed in Kuala Lumpur by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and the Malaysian Minister of Higher Education Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled bin Nordin.

Mr Joyce is in Malaysia for New Zealand Week, a series of events designed to showcase the education and trade opportunities in New Zealand.

New Zealand and Malaysia have a long education history, dating back to the early days of the Colombo Plan, a co-operative plan from 1951 that has seen many Malaysians study in New Zealand under education scholarships.

“The signing of the Arrangement reinforces and modernises the education relationship between our two countries. It lays out how we will work closely together on the opportunities of international education,” Mr Joyce says.

“Education is both an essential platform for our broader bilateral relationship and a catalyst for the economic advancement of both our countries. Just as important though, are the social and cultural benefits that we all enjoy from such links.

“The current academic relationship between Malaysia and New Zealand sees nearly 2,000 Malaysian students studying in New Zealand each year. New Zealand’s tertiary education system is well-placed to meet growing demand from the Malaysian market in the areas of teacher training, postgraduate studies and research and innovation.

“The Arrangement for Higher Education Co-operation further solidifies the relationship between New Zealand and Malaysia and provides opportunities for tertiary education providers to work closer together.”
