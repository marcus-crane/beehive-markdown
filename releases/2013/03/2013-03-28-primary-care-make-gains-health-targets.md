The latest results for the primary care health targets show 32 out of 35 primary health organisations (PHOs) achieved the increased immunisation target for eight month olds.

“It’s very encouraging to see the way general practice doctors and nurses are focused on improving performance in these important preventative health areas,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“While more work is needed to achieve the better help for smokers to quit and more heart and diabetes check targets, significant improvements have been made since the targets were first published.

“Performance in the more heart and diabetes checks target has increased by seven per cent in the last six months and the better help for smokers to quit target has increased by six per cent.

“Improving performance in the preventative health targets is important for the health of New Zealanders. I encourage PHOs and practices to continue working to ensure further improvement in these priority areas,” says Mr Ryall.

PHOs are funded by district health boards to provide health care services through general practices to patients who are enrolled with them.
