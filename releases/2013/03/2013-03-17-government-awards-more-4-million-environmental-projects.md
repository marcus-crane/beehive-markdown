A project that will use recycled potato starch to produce more than 17 million compostable packaging trays annually is among the successful recipients of more than $4 million in government funding.

Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced funding of more than $4 million to 11 innovative waste minimisation projects around New Zealand.

Earthpac receives $2.1 million for a project to manufacture compostable meat and vegetable trays. The trays are produced by capturing starch generated from washing potatoes.

“Currently, more than 200 million polystyrene trays are estimated to go to landfill each year in New Zealand. As a country, we need to be thinking smarter about ways to reduce our waste,” Ms Adams says.

“That is why I am pleased to be able to back a project that will make a significant difference to the amount of waste going to landfill and provide a fundamental change in the way waste is managed.

“This is a project which shows Kiwi ingenuity is able to develop world-leading, practical ideas that enhance our clean, green image.”

More than 670 tonnes of potato starch, which is normally discharged to a wastewater plant, will be used annually to make the compostable trays.

Other funding recipients include Environment Canterbury which receives $144,000 to carry out a feasibility study to minimise hazardous treated timber waste.

The project will have a particular focus on earthquake-related building and demolition waste in Canterbury.

The Project Litefoot Trust has been awarded $197,000 to establish a recycling programme for sports clubs around the country. So far the project has encouraged 60 clubs in the Wellington region to recycle paper, cardboard, plastics and food waste.

“Successful applicants that have been awarded funding have really thought outside the square and have been proactive in identifying ways to minimise waste going to landfill in New Zealand.

“Supporting these projects through the Waste Minimisation Fund is a practical way the Government can encourage New Zealanders to reuse, recycle, recover and decrease the amount of waste going to our landfills.”
