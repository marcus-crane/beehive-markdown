The first site work on Christchurch’s six hundred million dollar plus hospitals redevelopment project will start in a couple of months says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Cabinet has agreed to set aside around $500 million from the Future Investment Fund for the largest and most complex building project in the history of New Zealand’s public health service,” Mr Ryall says. “The total cost of the project is expected to be more than $600 million including a contribution from Canterbury DHB.

“The rebuild will go a long way to setting Canterbury health services back on their feet after the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

Burwood and Christchurch Hospitals will together have 938 beds, an increase of 159, and eight extra operating theatres, to a total of 24.

Construction is being fast tracked at Burwood Hospital with some site clearing beginning mid this year. Construction contracts will be let by Christmas, with completion in 2015.

t will have a new facility for older people’s health including nine 24 bed wards and adult rehabilitation. 

Christchurch Hospital’s redevelopment includes a new expanded intensive care unit and emergency department, purpose-designed space for children, eight new operating theatres, inpatient wards and new outpatient facilities. It is due for completion in 2018.

“This project will give a tremendous boost to doctors, nurses and other health professionals as well as the general public.  Christchurch will have world class facilities once the rebuild is complete,” Mr Ryall says.

“This is possible because the Hospital Partnership Group – made up of Canterbury DHB, officials and others in the health sector was able to fast-track the project.

“To ensure the momentum continues, at least in the design phase, the Hospital Partnership Group will continue to lead the project working very closely with CDHB.

“This will allow the DHB to focus on the delivery of services and repairing other health facilities that have been damaged by the earthquakes.

Mr Ryall says he wanted to personally thank Canterbury DHB and the large number of local health professionals who are involved in the project assisting  in the hospitals’ detailed design.

“And I have been thoroughly impressed by the work that has been done to hold Canterbury’s health services together since the quakes under trying circumstances,” Mr Ryall says.
