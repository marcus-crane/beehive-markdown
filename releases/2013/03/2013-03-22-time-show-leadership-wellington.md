Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister and Wellington-based Member of Parliament Christopher Finlayson says he is very disappointed at the on-going inability of the Wellington City Council to get its act together and progress the Basin Reserve Flyover.

“This latest vote to do nothing is illustrative of a Council wasting time and ratepayer money when a decision should have been made some time ago,” he said.

“The Mayor and Council have shown a conspicuous lack of leadership on this issue. The government is investing large sums to develop a National War Memorial Park in Buckle Street, and a world class precinct in and around the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. These projects are ahead of schedule, along with a comprehensive package of roading improvements.”

“Meanwhile, the Wellington City Council is failing to seize this important opportunity for its ratepayers and residents, and for the good of the whole region. Members of Parliament representing other cities  would certainly appreciate support of this type.”

“I want to make clear that I do not include in my criticism the Deputy Mayor, Ian McKinnon. He had to leave the Council meeting before a vote could be conducted because of the prolonged debate. That debate should have been concluded not earlier at that meeting, but long before now.”
