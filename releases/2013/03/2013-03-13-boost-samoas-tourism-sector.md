Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand is providing $4 million to help Samoa’s tourism sector recover from the devastating impact of Cyclone Evan.

“New Zealand and Samoa agree that a strong tourism sector is essential for employment opportunities, foreign exchange earnings and government revenue,” Mr McCully says.

“Early recovery for the tourism sector will be especially important to revive income and employment, and would ensure preparedness for the UN Small Islands Developing States conference to be hosted by Samoa in 2014.”

The funding will assist with the reconstruction of tourist accommodation and infrastructure, human resources development and training, technical assistance to strengthen disaster resilience, and future insurance coverage.
