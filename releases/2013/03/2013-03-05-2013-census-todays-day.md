Today is census day – the day New Zealand takes a snapshot of how many people and dwellings there are in the country.

Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson is encouraging everyone to fill out their census forms – online if possible.

“Census information is used by businesses, iwi, councils and the government to make decisions on issues that affect us all.

“I want to remind everyone that not only is it important to take part, it’s also important to fill in forms honestly. If the wrong information is provided we won’t have a true picture of the country, and that could affect decisions made in areas such as health or transport.”

Taking part in the census is a legal requirement. If you are in New Zealand today, whether you are a permanent resident, a visitor, a child or an adult, you must take part.

“While Statistics NZ is aiming for 35 per cent online participation, I’m hopeful it will be closer to 50 per cent,” Maurice Williamson says.

It’s expected more than two million forms will be completed via the internet.

“From tomorrow census collectors will be out on the road again to collect forms that aren’t filled in online. Census results will be released from December.”

Either online or on paper, all census information is kept confidential by Statistics NZ and can only be used for statistical purposes.
