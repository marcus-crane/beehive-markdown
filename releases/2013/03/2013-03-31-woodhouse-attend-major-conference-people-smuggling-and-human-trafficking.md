New Zealand’s commitment to preventing people smuggling and human trafficking will be reinforced this week at a major conference of Ministers from the Asia-Pacific region.

Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse leaves today for Indonesia to attend the fifth Bali Process Ministerial Conference, bringing together 43 countries to find practical measures to prevent and deter the irregular movement of people.   

“Attending the Bali Process confirms New Zealand’s support and commitment to tackling the problem of people smuggling and human trafficking.  

“The Bali Process is about working together effectively to prevent and deter these dangerous and undesirable activities and improve our own border security as a result,’’ Mr Woodhouse says.

“I am also looking forward to the discussions on combatting human trafficking, following the government's Plan of Action to prevent human trafficking that was launched in 2009.”

Mr Woodhouse says the Plan puts specific strategies in place to prosecute traffickers to the full extent of the law, and help meet the needs of victims.
