Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Period 26 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 26, which was paid last Wednesday morning (20 March), paid 87,445 people a total of $176.54 million. This was 2623 more staff than for Pay Period 25.

The PwC report records that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.43 per cent of staff across the country. 84 staff were notified as not paid, 122 were overpaid, and 173 underpaid. Affected staff were from 232 schools or 9.5 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 26 data compares with 1 per cent of staff and 406 schools about which complaints and notifications were received for Pay Period 25; 1.9 per cent and 447 schools in Pay Period 24; and 2.2 per cent and 628 schools for Pay Period 23.

Mr Joyce says the next pay round, Pay Period 1, will be the first of the new financial year and that may create additional errors as it contains a number of significant changes including adjustments to KiwiSaver and student loan repayment rates.

“As a consequence, it is anticipated that transaction numbers will be higher for this pay round,” Mr Joyce says.

“The pay teams are putting in every effort to complete processing ahead of next week’s pay going through and will be on deck working hard over Easter weekend.”

Mr Joyce said over the past weekend Talent2 undertook its second scheduled software release as part of the Novopay Remediation Plan.

“The objective was to address a further 143 bug fixes in the system during the software release. However a decision was taken late last week to undertake additional testing in relation to 61 of the defects before release.

“As a result 83 bugs were successfully resolved in the release – including 14 category two (very serious) bugs. The remaining 61 bug fixes from Round Two will be the subject of an additional release in the next two to three weeks.”

A total of 170 defects have now been successfully resolved in Remediation Plan bug fixes so far.

The Ministerial Inquiry into Novopay is also underway with submissions opening this Thursday until 18 April. Submissions can be made online from Thursday morning.

“This will provide the opportunity for schools, school administrators and education sector groups to provide input into the Ministerial Inquiry,” Mr Joyce says.

The Ministerial Inquiry, which will cover all aspects of the teacher payroll system from outset to present day, is being undertaken by former Chief Executive of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Sir Maarten Wevers and Chairman of Deloitte New Zealand Murray Jack. It is due to report back by the end of May.
