New Zealand and Malaysia’s top emerging fashion designers are collaborating in a fashion competition to celebrate New Zealand Week, and create stronger links in international education, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

Mr Joyce attended a fashion show and Gala Event in Kuala Lumpur today showcasing up and coming fashion designers from the top Malaysian and New Zealand Schools of Design. The event was to celebrate New Zealand Week in Malaysia – a series of events to lift the profile of New Zealand as an international education and trade destination. New Zealand Week runs from 11 to 15 March.

“Students from New Zealand were partnered with students from Malaysia and they worked together online to design, create and stylise fashion items for the show,” Mr Joyce says.

“It’s great to see New Zealand institutions partnering with their Malaysian counterparts and giving students in both countries the opportunity to work together to create some outstanding pieces for the fashion show.

“This is another example of innovation in our tertiary education sector to help foster and grow education relationships with other countries, which is critical if New Zealand is going to double the earnings from international education to $5 billion by 2025.”
