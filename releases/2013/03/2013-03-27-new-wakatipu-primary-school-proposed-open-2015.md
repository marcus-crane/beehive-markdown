Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the Government is proposing to open a new primary school in 2015 to cater for the growing population in the Wakatipu Basin.

The new $14 million school, which will be located at the Shotover development adjacent to the Lake Hayes estate, will cater for year one-to-eight students across Queenstown, Frankton Flats, Arrowtown and Lake Hayes.

“The Government recognises that the population is growing in that area. There were around 1635 primary school-age students in the Wakatipu Basin as at July 2012, and the number is expected to grow to approximately 2400 by 2020.

“The proposed new school will take pressure off neighbouring state schools, especially Queenstown School, Remarkables Primary School and Arrowtown School.

“It will be a modern, 21st century school with flexible learning areas, access to ultra-fast broadband, and energy efficient buildings. It will serve communities for many years to come and ensure each and every child gets a great education.’’

Consultation will now take place with neighbouring schools and communities. While that is occurring nominations for the establishment board will be sought.

The establishment board will develop the new school’s charter, and influence school design. It will also appoint the principal and staff, and work with its community to build a vision and school culture which supports learning and achievement for all its students.

Ms Parata says the establishment of new primary provision and the planned relocation of Wakatipu High School from Queenstown to the newly acquired site in Frankton’s Remarkables Park is in accord with the Wakatipu Area Strategy and will meet the needs of the community in the short to medium term.
