Prime Minister John Key will host Thailand’s Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra when she visits New Zealand later this week.

This is the first visit to New Zealand by Ms Shinawatra since becoming Prime Minister in 2011.

Mr Key says New Zealand’s relationship with Thailand is a close and warm one, and this visit underscores those close ties and looks towards new areas of cooperation.

“Our two countries have common views on many issues and I look forward to having constructive discussions with Prime Minister Yingluck.”

New Zealand and Thailand have shared interests in political, security, economic, education, science and technology and development issues. This partnership is maintained through regular high-level political exchanges, and through strong people-to-people links bolstered by strong Thai interest in New Zealand’s educational opportunities.

The two countries have a strong trade relationship, with goods’ trade doubling since the New Zealand/Thailand Closer Economic Partnership Agreement was brought into force in 2005. 

“I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Yingluck opportunities to build on this.  We welcome the inclusion of a number of Thai business leaders in the visit delegation and hope that their time in New Zealand will contribute to increased business linkages between Thailand and New Zealand.”

Prime Minister Yingluck arrives in Auckland on Friday 22 March for her three-day visit, where she will attend a business luncheon before meeting with Mr Key at Government House for bilateral talks and an official dinner. During her visit Prime Minister Yingluck will also have an opportunity to see New Zealand’s quality dairy systems.
