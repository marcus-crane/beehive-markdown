Commerce Minister Craig Foss has released a discussion document seeking feedback on proposals to improve New Zealand’s standards system.

“Standards are an important component of a productive and competitive economy. They contribute to the development of healthy, safe and efficiently-made products, and support our exporters by ensuring New Zealand standards are consistent with those of our key trading partners,” says Mr Foss.

The discussion document focuses on three proposals:

- strengthening the contribution of standards to areas such as international trade, building and construction, innovation and health and safety with the support of a national standards body,
- enabling others, such as industry groups, to produce New Zealand standards,
- changing the national standards body’s organisational form to enhance capability, promote cost effectiveness and provide better scalability.

“Standards play an important role in our economy. It is important we have modern and flexible standards in place. I urge all interested parties to have their say on this discussion document,” says Mr Foss.

Submissions close 26 April 2013.
