Education Minister Hekia Parata will attend the third International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP) in Amsterdam next week accompanied by union and teacher leaders.

“The Summit is a great opportunity for all Ministers to hear how other nations manage and develop the critical area of teacher quality. I am pleased that my invitation to join me has been taken up by NZEI President Judith Nowotarski, PPTA President Angela Roberts, NZPF President and Paparoa Street School Principal Phil Harding and Manurewa Intermediate Principal Iain Taylor,’’ says Ms Parata.

The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Education International (EI) are bringing together Education Ministers, Education Leaders, Teacher Leaders and Union Leaders from 25 best performing countries and the 5 fastest risers, as specified by the PISA study of 2009.

This year‘s Summit on March 13-14 focuses on teacher quality - specifically the issues of professional standards and teacher appraisal. Ms Parata will be addressing a session of the Summit on teacher evaluation in New Zealand.

“Again, I expect the Summit will also allow us to look at how other countries are raising achievement for students, in particular for those groups who our system has historically underperformed for, which is a key focus for our Government.

Over the five days of the visit Ms Parata will also be in London to meet Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted), Chair of the UK Parliamentary Committee on Education and the Director of the Institute of Education, University of London.

She will also travel to Paris and meet with UNESCO officials, the Director-General of International Relations in the French Ministry of Education and the Associate Minister of Education.
