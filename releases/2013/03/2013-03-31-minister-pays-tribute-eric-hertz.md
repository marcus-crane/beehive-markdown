Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today paid tribute to 2degrees chief executive Eric Hertz.

Mr Hertz and his wife Kathy are believed dead after their plane crashed into the sea following engine problems yesterday.

“My thoughts are with Eric and Kathy’s family, friends, and the team at 2degrees as they come to terms with this terrible tragedy," Ms Adams says.

“Eric was one of the true gentleman of the sector and it was a pleasure to work with him.

“He often spoke of how much he loved living in New Zealand. Only recently I ran into him at the Waimakariri Gorge while he was competing in this year’s Coast to Coast.”

Mr Hertz joined 2degrees in 2009 and made a substantial difference to the telecommunications scene in New Zealand.

“He has been an integral part of the creation and growth of 2degrees, and there are hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who are today benefiting from Eric’s vision and commitment.

“Eric will leave a significant gap in the telecommunications community.”
