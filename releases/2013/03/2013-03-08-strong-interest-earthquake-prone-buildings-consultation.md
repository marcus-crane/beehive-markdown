Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says there has been a strong public response to the earthquake-prone building public consultation which ends today.

“The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have to date received 315 submissions on its proposals to change the system for dealing with earthquake-prone buildings.”

This includes 270 from individuals and 45 from organisations such as local authorities, representatives of engineers, property owners and people with disabilities and heritage building interests.

“I’m pleased the consultation has generated so much public interest and feedback. 1,000 people also attended public meetings around the country.”

“This whole process is about striking an acceptable balance between the risks posed by earthquake-prone buildings and the costs of strengthening or demolishing them,” Maurice Williamson says.

The Ministry’s consultation document proposes a consistent national approach for dealing with earthquake-prone buildings. This includes requiring all buildings to be assessed within five years. If buildings are deemed to be earthquake-prone they would then be required to be strengthened or demolished within ten years.

“As I have stressed during the consultation period, the proposals are just a starting point and some changes are likely after submissions are analysed.

The Cabinet will consider what policy changes to make and an announcement will be made later this year.

“Legislation would follow, along with the opportunity for further public input through the select committee process. It’s likely there will be a transition period between legislation passing and the changes taking effect, so that implementation issues can be worked through with councils, engineers and others,” Mr Williamson says.
