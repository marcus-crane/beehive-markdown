Hospice New Zealand will receive more than $300,000 extra funding over the next two years to help improve the quality of care and support for terminally ill people and their families.

“This funding will help Hospice New Zealand provide support and leadership to hospices, to ensure the high standard of hospice care currently provided is maintained and improved,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“While medical progress finds new cures at an accelerating pace, there will always be a need for the care of people with a life limiting or life threatening condition.

“Part of the funding will also be used on workforce initiatives to ensure hospices can continue to meet the needs of their communities and every New Zealander, no matter where they live, has access to the same high quality hospice services.

“The funding is part of the $15 million per year Boost Hospice Care funding this government introduced in 2009 to help hospices expand care and services and meet financial challenges.

“Hospice makes a huge difference to people's lives – ensuring that terminally ill people are as free from pain and suffering as possible. They also care for families and friends, both before and after the death of a loved one.”
