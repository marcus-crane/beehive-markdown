Children’s Day is officially marked on Sunday 3 March, but the entire weekend will see communities get together across the country to celebrate children and positive parenting.

“Hundreds of events are happening around the country this weekend to mark this special day,” Social Development Minister Paula Bennett said.

Events include enjoy bouncy castles, music, face painting, treasure hunts, and fun activities for children and families.

“This is a chance to have a laugh with your kids, and get together with other families to celebrate the enduring theme, Treasure Our Children.”

“Children depend on adults to care for them, and we all have a responsibility for their welfare and wellbeing. This is a time when we can reflect on the best ways give our children the support and security they need.”

“It’s also a time to think about the children who don’t have supportive parents and who live in abusive homes – we need to speak up for them.”

Following the release of the White Paper last year, the Children’s Action Plan is already underway, with a clear focus on protecting vulnerable children.

“We all have a responsibility to protect children in our wider families and communities, this country can and will do better for New Zealand children.”

The weekend’s events include parenting information, healthy eating and home safety tips and various social sector representatives will be on hand to answer questions or concerns.

Mrs Bennett will be attending Toddler Day Out at the Trusts Arena in Auckland tomorrow to celebrate Children’s Day. 

“This is a fantastic day out for under-fives and their families. Thanks to the dedication of Violence Free Waitakere and the ECE Network of Waitakere, the year marks the 10th anniversary of the event – a great milestone.”

“I encourage parents and caregivers to check out what’s happening in their community. If you can’t make it to an event, you might like to have a special family activity at home to mark the day,” Mrs Bennett said.

“What matters the most is taking the time to let your children know how special they are.”
