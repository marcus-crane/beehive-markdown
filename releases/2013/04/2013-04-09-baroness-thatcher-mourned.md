Justice Minister Judith Collins has today paid tribute to the late former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

“Baroness Thatcher was a highly intelligent, brave, formidable woman who led Britain from what were very difficult times to greater prosperity and economic certainty,” Ms Collins says.

“She was Britain’s first, and remains the only, female Prime Minister, a wife and doting mother and grandmother.

“I respect her for being a woman of conviction who stood firmly for individuals, families and for Britain.

“Today our thoughts are with Baroness Thatcher’s family, friends and with all of Britain as they mourn the passing of a most courageous and inspirational icon.”
