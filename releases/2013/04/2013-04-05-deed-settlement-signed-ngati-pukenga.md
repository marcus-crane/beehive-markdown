The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for historical Treaty claims with Ngāti Pukenga at Te Whetū o Te Rangi Marae near Tauranga, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The deed settles the comprehensive claims specific to Ngāti Pukenga in the region. Ngāti Pūkenga is also negotiating redress relating to its shared and overlapping interests in the region as part of the Tauranga Moana Collective, along with Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui and Ngāi Te Rangi.

“Crown initiated military conflict in 1864 and subsequent actions including confiscation left Ngāti Pukenga without sufficient land in Tauranga to meet their economic and cultural needs,” Mr Finlayson said. “We can never fully compensate for these wrongs. However this settlement will enable the people of Ngati Pukenga to look forward to a stronger future.”

The settlement includes includes financial and commercial redress of $5 million; the return of culturally significant properties including Liens block, Pae ki Hauraki, Te Tihi o Hauturu and Otukopiri; $500,000 for cultural revitalisation, and $180,000 for marae revitalisation in Manaia.

“Signing this deed of settlement with Ngāti Pukenga is an important step towards settling all historical grievances in the Bay of Plenty and New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Finlayson said.

The settlement will be given effect through legislation.
