Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr. Pita Sharples, has congratulated Miraka, a Māori owned milk processing company for entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with Shanghai Pengxin.

The relationship signed today signifies the intent by Shanghai Pengxin to secure supply of milk from their New Zealand farms for processing at Miraka’s planned UHT plant once it has been completed.

Dr Sharples, who attended the signing ceremony today in Shanghai said “I am pleased for both Miraka and Shanghai Pengxin. This celebration today is the result of building solid relationships between two organisations and two cultures, which have resulted in a partnership of mutual benefit.”

“This MoU supports Māori investment in the dairy industry, which can have flow on effects for other Māori businesses.”

Dr Sharples said “one of the priorities within the Māori Economic Strategy, He Kai Kei Aku Ringa, is to support Māori business to engage in international markets, and build relationships with organisations around the world. The relationship between Miraka and Shanghai Pengxin is a clear example of how ‘Māori Inc’ can contribute to economic outcomes in practice.”

“The seeds of the relationship between Miraka and Shanghai Pengxin were sown during our last Māori business delegation trip to China, whereby ‘Māori Inc’ organisations such as the Māori Trustee and the Māori Tourism Council visited Shanghai Pengxin. The Māori Trustee played a critical role in bringing Miraka and Shanghai Pengxin together, and the result has been the relationship that we have come to celebrate today.”

“This is great news, and I congratulate all organisations involved in this bringing this relationship into fruition, and look forward to celebrating similar success stories in the future.”
