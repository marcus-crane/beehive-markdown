Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee is welcoming today's announcement that the NZ Transport Agency has shortlisted two consortiums to deliver the long-awaited Transmission Gully project.

The successful consortia are:

Wellington Gateway Partnership

•           Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd (lead)

•           HEB Construction Ltd

•           InfraRed Infrastructure General Partner Ltd

•           The Bank of Tokyo–Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd (BTMU)

•           Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC)

Positive Connection

•           John Laing Investments Ltd (lead)

•           Fulton Hogan Ltd

•           The Fletcher Construction Company Ltd

•           Macquarie Group Holdings New Zealand Ltd

•           Woodward Infrastructure Ltd as General Partner of Public Infrastructure Partners LP (PIP Fund)

“This is another important step towards providing motorists and businesses in the lower North Island with a quicker, safer and more reliable route in and out of the capital, bypassing many of the bottle necks and hazardous areas that drivers currently have to deal with on this part of State Highway 1.”

The 27 kilometre long highway will form a key part of the Wellington Northern Corridor, one of seven key state highway routes being progressed by the Government as Roads of National Significance to reduce congestion, improve safety and support economic growth.

Mr Brownlee says the Wellington region has been waiting for Transmission Gully for over 70 years.

“Wellington is currently reliant on a two-lane highway that has trouble coping in peak times, and is vulnerable to closure in the event of crashes and natural disasters.

“Our capital city deserves better if it’s to reach its full economic potential, and the Transmission Gully route will help to unlock that potential.

“Transmission Gully will provide a safer, more secure strategic route in and out of Wellington that will cater for the increased traffic and freight demands that come with a growing city, and as part of the Wellington Northern Corridor it will significantly improve travel times between Wellington and the lower North Island.”

Mr Brownlee said the project had been on the books for many years, and Cabinet's approval last year of an application from the NZ Transport Agency to pursue a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to finance, build and maintain the highway had allowed the NZTA to move forward.

"Today's announcement of a shortlist is another important step towards beginning construction of the Transmission Gully project in 2014 and opening the road by 2020, delivering the economic and safety benefits to New Zealanders within eight years.

Mr Brownlee says the Government had signalled the likelihood of using a PPP arrangement to progress Transmission Gully as early as March 2009, when the Roads of National Significance Programme was first announced.

“An alternative state highway route into the capital through Transmission Gully has been talked about for decades, and this Government is committed to making it a reality.”
