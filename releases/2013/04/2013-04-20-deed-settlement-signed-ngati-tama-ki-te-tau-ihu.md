The Crown has signed a Deed of Settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty of Waitangi claims with Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu at Onetahua Marae in Pohara, Golden Bay today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

“This settlement acknowledges and provides some redress for the breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi by the Crown,” Mr Finlayson said. “The actions of the Crown left Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu virtually landless, and have had devastating consequences for the iwi’s social and cultural wellbeing. Today we seek to mend a broken relationship and move forward together.”

The Deed of Settlement sets out financial redress of $12.06 million, the opportunity to purchase Rai, Golden Downs and Motueka Crown forestry land near Nelson, and in particular recognises the strong association and connection Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu has with Te Tai Tapu, Farewell Spit and Te Waikoropupū Springs.

This is the final Deed of Settlement to be signed in the South Island.

Legislation giving effect to Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu’s settlement as well as the other seven  Te Tau Ihu (top of the South Island) settlements will be introduced into the House later this year.

Copies of the Deed are available on the Office of Treaty Settlements website [www.ots.govt.nz](http://www.ots.govt.nz).
