Around 690,000 New Zealanders have had a flu vaccination this year – 100,000 more than the same time last year.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says never before have so many influenza vaccines been distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the first six weeks of the influenza campaign.

“We are well over half way to reaching our goal of immunising 1.2 million New Zealanders this year – which will be a record number,” says Mr Ryall.

“In the last couple of years, around 1 million New Zealanders have had their flu vaccination annually.

“We want more New Zealanders to be protected against this serious disease and I encourage you to get your flu vaccination.

“TV advertisements start this weekend to remind people of the benefits of being protected against the strains of flu circulating this winter.

“New Zealanders over the age of 65, pregnant women, children under the age of five with significant respiratory illnesses and people with on-going health conditions or heart problems are able to get the flu vaccine for free.

“People who are not eligible for the free programme can purchase the vaccine from their general practitioner or selected pharmacies.”
