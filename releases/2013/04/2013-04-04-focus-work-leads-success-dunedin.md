Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today congratulated local success in Dunedin through work and training programmes.

“Going from being on benefit to being in work isn’t always easy and takes real effort and determination, but I’m backing people to do this with the right support.”

Around the country, the Government has been working with employers, local councils and community groups to get people off welfare into work, this support is paying off.

“Twenty–four out of thirty young people on a recent *Ready Steady Work* programme, led by the Mayor and funded by Work and Income, are now in work, that’s fantastic.”

Minister Bennett today met with Mayor Bryan Cadogan, representatives from Southern Cross Forest Products and local Work and Income work brokers about the joint initiative *Ready, Steady Work*, designed to reduce youth unemployment.

The course incorporates healthy eating, budgeting and mentoring with tours of local workplaces and mentoring continues while the young people are in their new jobs.

“Employers have been outstanding by stepping up and giving people a chance in work and apprenticeships, and the Government helps with subsidies to do so.”

Minister Bennett also met today with construction company Downer following two recruitment seminars held in the Dunedin Community Link rooms.

Successful seminar candidates were accepted on to a two-week *Skills for Industry* programme. Those who proved themselves there got a full-time job at the end.

Seventeen of the twenty young people on the course are now working with Downer, two others got jobs elsewhere.

“Congratulations to all of those job seekers who took an opportunity that was offered with both hands and showed employers what they are capable of.”

“I’m impressed with the attitude of those looking for work, of employers willing to take a chance on people and the way communities like Dunedin back their own.”
