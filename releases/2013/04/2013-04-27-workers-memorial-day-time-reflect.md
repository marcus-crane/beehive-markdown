Workers’ Memorial Day tomorrow is a time to remember not only those who’ve been killed or injured at work, but their friends and families too,” says Labour Minister Simon Bridges.

“The trauma of a workplace death never leaves those who are closest – family, friends and work colleagues. In some cases, these people can spend months, maybe years, caring for a loved one undergoing rehabilitation.

“Too many New Zealanders are killed or harmed at work. Workers’ Memorial Day is a time to reflect on the critical importance of safe and healthy workplaces,” says Mr Bridges.

“The rebuild of Canterbury, for example, must be the template for good workplace health and safety practices as thousands of workers become involved in this major reconstruction challenge.

“We all need to do more, and do it better, to make sure we are protected from injury and death when we go to work each day.

“Next week, the Independent Taskforce on Health and Safety will report with what I anticipate will be wide-ranging recommendations for reform of the system to bring down the death and injury toll in our workplaces,” says Mr Bridges.

“I intend considering these recommendations carefully.

“The Government has already moved to establish a Crown agent with a dedicated focus on health and safety. This was a key recommendation of the Royal Commission on Pike River and an early recommendation of the Taskforce.

“And we are making good progress on delivering on our commitment to follow through on every recommendation of the Royal Commission,” Mr Bridges says.
