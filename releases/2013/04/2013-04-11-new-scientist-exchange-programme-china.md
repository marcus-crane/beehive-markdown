Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce yesterday signed a scientist exchange programme between New Zealand and China at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Mr Joyce signed the arrangement with China’s Science and Technology Minister, Wan Gang, following bilateral talks between Prime Minister John Key and new Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

“China is a major global science and research player,” Mr Joyce says.

“This programme will continue to help broaden and deepen relationships between New Zealand and Chinese scientists in areas of mutual interest.”

Mr Joyce is currently accompanying Prime Minister John Key, who is leading a large delegation of senior officials and business people on an official visit to China to celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations.

The signing of the new arrangement is part of a broad range of initiatives being announced during the trip aimed at deepening ties between the two countries.

Mr Joyce says the scientist exchange programme is intended to encourage greater understanding, and development of research linkages between New Zealand and Chinese researchers, and to facilitate access to expertise in each country.

Collaboration will be targeted at priority areas like non-communicable diseases, food security and safety, and water research. Up to 10 scientists will travel in each direction each year to engage in projects.

The programme will run for three years and will be administered in New Zealand by the Royal Society of New Zealand. It replaces a similar arrangement, which expired in February 2013.
