Conservation Minister Nick Smith today congratulated Al Morrison on his appointment as a Deputy Commissioner at the State Services Commission and thanked him for his 11 years of service at the Department of Conservation.

“Al Morrison has been an outstanding leader of the Department of Conservation and has led new thinking in the way in which New Zealand values and manages its natural assets,” Dr Smith said.

“I’ve valued a close working relationship with Al and admire his deep commitment to conservation and the natural resource sector. It’s a sign of Al’s success as a chief executive of one of New Zealand’s largest operational departments that he’s taking up a newly created leadership role at the State Services Commission. He has been a leader in getting government departments to work more closely together and this will be invaluable in his new role.

“I commend Al on leading the department through this difficult but necessary period of restructuring. I’m pleased he’s committed to staying on until September to see the change programme through.

“I have asked the SSC to move with pace in recruiting a new chief executive to lead DOC so as to ensure momentum is maintained in DOC’s work and direction.”
