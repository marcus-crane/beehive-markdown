Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman says the Provincial Reconstruction Team has now completely departed from Kiwi Base in Bamyan, marking of the end of 10 years of service in the Afghanistan province.

“I’ve been advised by the Defence Force that the final contingent of CRIB 21 soldiers has departed Bamyan on a RNZAF C-130 plane for the Bagram Air Field. They will spend a further few days there packing and cleaning equipment before returning to New Zealand next week,” said Dr Coleman.

The contingent’s departure is the final act in the closure of Kiwi Base. It follows a flag lowering ceremony and the unveiling of a memorial last week which was attended by the Governor General, Minister of Defence, Chief of Defence Force, Secretary of Defence, and the Commissioner of Police.

“It has been a complicated logistical exercise to depart from Kiwi Base over recent weeks. In total 470 tonnes of equipment requiring 35 C130 flights have been required. The theatre extraction procession has been successfully led by Lt Col Richard Weston,” said Dr Coleman.

New Zealand continues to maintain a presence in Afghanistan with 27 NZDF personnel based in Kabul and several agricultural and renewable energy projects being operated in Bamyan.
