Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman says he welcomes the Labour Party’s acknowledgement today the Seasprite helicopter replaces a vital capability to the Defence Force.

The government has announced eight Seasprites (plus two spare airframes) will be purchased from the United States company Kaman Aerospace in a $242 million dollar deal, which includes a training simulator, missiles, and additional components.

“While stating the Seasprites add useful capability, the opposition Defence spokesman, Phil Goff, made a number of factual errors in his comments,” said Dr Coleman.

“Mr Goff claims the purchase of these aircraft were not on the long-term capital purchase programme for the Defence Force. I invite him to read the Defence Capability Plan. The upgrade or replacement of the maritime naval helicopters is a project listed on pages 26 and 28 of the Defence Capability Plan, published in September 2011.”

“Labour further compounded the error by asking if further cuts are being planned to pay for them since they weren’t on the capital plan. It’s an unnecessary question. The capital cost of purchase and introduction into service is funded from NZDF accumulated depreciation that has already been set aside. The operating cost is funded from savings already made.”

“Mr Goff has asserted the US Defence Department attempted to give the helicopters away as part of an excess military equipment programme after Australia turned the contract down. He is simply wrong. That was before the helicopters were rebuilt and modernised for Australia’s $A1.1 billion dollar project, not afterwards,” he said.

“Finally, Mr Goff says he needs to know if there will be sufficient spares for the helicopters. The availability and cost of spare parts was a major focus of the Ministry of Defence evaluation of the helicopters. Kaman is providing a significant package of spare parts. Also the NZDF already holds spares for the basic aircraft and engines. This deal positions the NZDF with an extensive package of spares and access to a well-resourced supply chain,” said Dr Coleman.
