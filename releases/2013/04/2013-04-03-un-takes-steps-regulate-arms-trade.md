Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the approval of the Arms Trade Treaty by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  

“The Arms Trade Treaty is the first international treaty to regulate the $70 billion global arms trade,” Mr McCully says.

“As well as setting down common global standards for trade in conventional weapons, the adoption of the Treaty will also help prevent illicit arms trade. 

“New Zealand has a proud history of taking a leadership role on international disarmament issues. We are committed to working through the UN system to make the world safer and prevent arms from falling into the wrong hands.

“Throughout the negotiations, New Zealand worked closely with delegations from regions that have suffered from the uncontrolled flow of arms, including Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

“We will continue to work with like-minded countries and the UN to further disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives,” Mr McCully says.

The Arms Trade Treaty text will open for signature in June.
