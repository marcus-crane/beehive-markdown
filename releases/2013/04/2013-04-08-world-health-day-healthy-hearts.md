Noting World Health Day on Sunday, Health Minister Tony Ryall has thanked New Zealand’s health professionals for their hard work and commitment to providing New Zealanders with more heart and diabetes checks in the community.

Mr Ryall says the World Health Day theme of reducing high blood pressure is a Government priority, through its national target to improve the number of heart and diabetes checks.

“We know that high blood pressure or hypertension increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure. If picked up it can be treated and advice given on steps to reduce it,” Mr Ryall says.

“Our most recent results show that primary care services in 19 out of the 20 district health boards are doing better with their heart and diabetes checks for eligible people.

“There’s been a lot of effort put into this area of health, and doctors and nurses in primary care are doing a great job to help protect the health of New Zealanders.

I’d also like to congratulate the Heart Foundation for its information campaign promoting CVD risk assessment.

Nearly 100,000 “How’s your engine” flyers have been distributed through Heart Foundation networks, and another 40,000 are being sent out today.
