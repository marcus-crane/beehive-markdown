Health Minister Tony Ryall is calling for nominations for the first Minister of Health Volunteer Awards to celebrate New Zealand’s health volunteers.

“Health volunteers from all over the country give their time freely to improve the quality of lives of New Zealanders and deserve special recognition for their dedication, generosity and hard work,” says Mr Ryall.

“From delivering meals on wheels to supporting patients and their families at hospices – volunteers make a difference to the health of New Zealanders.

“These awards celebrate and recognise the dedicated volunteers who are a valued part of New Zealand’s public health service.

“If you know an individual or group of people who make a difference in the lives of others by giving their time to help, I encourage you to nominate them.”

Nominations open today and close 3 May 2013.

Award categories, criteria and information on how to nominate can be found on the awards website: [www.volunteerawards.health.govt.nz](http://www.volunteerawards.health.govt.nz)
