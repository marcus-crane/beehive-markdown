Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will depart today on a two-week trip to Africa and Europe.

Mr McCully will be attending bilateral meetings and promoting New Zealand’s bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.

In Africa, Mr McCully will visit South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Mauritius and Mozambique, and meet the Secretary General of the Indian Ocean Commission.

“Africa is the centre of remarkable growth and is of growing importance to New Zealand. Our agricultural expertise is of particular interest in southern Africa,” Mr McCully says.

From Africa, Mr McCully will head to Brussels to attend NATO meetings on Afghanistan and debrief New Zealand’s partners on the withdrawal of the Provincial Reconstruction Team from Bamyan province.

“We will also discuss the transfer of security responsibility to the Government of Afghanistan, as well as New Zealand’s continued contribution to the country.”

Mr McCully will also visit Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein, Malta and San Marino.

“Europe is one of our major political and trading partners. This visit is a chance to further strengthen our relationships across the continent.”
