Police Minister Anne Tolley has officially opened the refurbished national headquarters for the Police Crime Reporting Line (CRL), at Harlech House in Otahuhu.

At a cost of just over $7 million, the revamped building will house 140 staff once the national rollout of the CRL is completed by the beginning of July. It is expected it will take around half a million calls a year.

The CRL gives the public 24-hour access to report historical and non-emergency crime, leaving emergency call centre staff free to deal with immediate issues, and allowing frontline Police to focus on prevention.

“This refurbished facility has an important role to play, as Police provide a more effective and smarter service to victims of crime and communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The CRL is accessed through calls to 111 or Police stations.

“Emergency call centres and Police district staff can, where appropriate, direct non-emergency calls and reporting of historical crime through to the Crime Reporting Line, where callers receive professional support and advice on next steps. As well as a more efficient service for callers, this gives emergency call staff more time to deal with urgent issues.

“The CRL is already operating in nine Police districts, including Wellington which came on board yesterday, and I’m advised that district staff are no longer overwhelmed by recording historic crime information, leaving them more time to focus on crime prevention.

“As part of Policing Excellence, the CRL plays an important part in helping Police tackle and prevent crime, and better support the victims of crime.

“Crime has fallen in each of the past three years, with 16.7 per cent fewer crimes overall, and the CRL is making an excellent contribution as we focus on making our communities even safer.

“I wish the CRL staff continued success in their more modern and impressive new surroundings.”
