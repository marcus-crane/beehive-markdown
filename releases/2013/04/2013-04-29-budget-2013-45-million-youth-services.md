Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has announced a decision to continue $4.5 million of funding so 46 service providers can continue working with young New Zealanders.

“This funding is to support youth service providers to deliver services to improve the lives of young people,” Ms Kaye says.

“These services include entrepreneurial skills, mentoring, and supporting young people to achieve through leadership initiatives.

“By enabling these organisations to provide challenging and other learning activities and offer services such as mentoring and skill development, we are empowering young people to actively participate in their community and develop the skills they need to contribute to a modern economy.

“The Spirit of Adventure Trust is one example of this.

“Over the past 39 years, almost 75,000 young New Zealanders have taken part in one of their sea voyages. The Trust continues to take more than 800 teenagers annually from across New Zealand on a unique and life changing journey.”

The Services for Young People fund is administered by the Ministry of Youth Development. It provides funding to a range of community based organisations to create opportunities for all 12 to 24 year olds to engage with their communities, be part of that community’s success, and learn new skills.

Information on providers receiving continued funding, including the amount received will be available on the Government’s contract mapping website at: [www.contractmapping.govt.nz](http://www.contractmapping.govt.nz) from 1 July 2013 once contracts are in place with provider organisations.
