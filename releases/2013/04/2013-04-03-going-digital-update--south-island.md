Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss is urging South Island residents to ensure their televisions can receive a digital signal ahead of the South Island’s digital switchover later this month.

“With just 25 days until the South Island switches over to digital television, it’s important that everyone makes sure they’re ready for the change,” says Mr Foss.

South Island Going Digital update

- 92 per cent of South Island households with a TV have already made the switch to digital television
- 98 per cent of South Island residents are aware that analogue transmission is ending
- 8394 applications under the Targeted Assistance Package (TAP) have been accepted
- Analogue crawlers are now live on TV ONE, TV3 and Prime in most parts of the South Island. These crawlers advise viewers that the analogue service is ending.

Mr Foss is meeting with community organisations in Christchurch today as the Going Digital team works to ensure everyone has access to information about the switch-over.

All regions will have gone digital by the end of 2013. The lower North Island and East Cape will be going digital on 29 September 2013.

The upper North Island will be going digital on 1 December 2013.
