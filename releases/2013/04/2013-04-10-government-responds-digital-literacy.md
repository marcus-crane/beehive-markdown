Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today tabled the Government’s undertaking to deliver on its commitment to digital literacy in education.

“Today I have tabled a high level response to the Education and Science Committee’s report, Inquiry into 21st Century learning environments and digital literacy,” Ms Kaye said.

“This confirms the Government’s view that all the recommendations are helpful and worthy of further consideration.

“In the past few months we have progressed six recommendations covering initiatives such as improved design templates for 21st century school buildings; a review of 21st century skills and digital literacy; and work on information science and ICT skills as career options.

“The Government’s recent announcements on holding cyber bullies to account are important because they will help ensure greater safety as more students learn on line.

“Other recommendations present challenging public policy issues where it will be necessary to consult further. Some of the more challenging issues cover access to devices, professional development and potential intellectual property issues.

“The Government has signed off on the development of a digital education strategy for 21st century learning environments. This will provide an integrated work plan to progress changes.

“I am also setting up a digital literacy reference group of professionals from the education and technology sectors to ensure that we have the right skill set at the table to help design some of these 21st century tools for learning. This group will be established in the next six weeks.

“We are aiming high for young New Zealanders to be the most digitally literate in the world so they can have every opportunity to be more innovative and better compete in a modern economy.

“This work is about realising the potential in our education system for more students learning online.

“Adopting the best approach to 21st century learning will require change across the education sector. It is critical that we recognise how much of this change is being driven by students themselves, and how eager they are to learn online through new applications, tools and content.

“We must not just respond, but join with students and their teachers in exploring the possibilities of online learning.

“Our Government expects that our education system will equip our young people with the values, skills and knowledge to be successful in the 21st century.

“This announcement is one of a number of steps to establish the platform for modern learning environments for all our students.”
