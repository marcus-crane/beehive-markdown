The Crown signed a Deed of Settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty of Waitangi claims with Ngāti Rārua at the Parerārua Centre in Blenheim today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

“The actions of the Crown left Ngāti Rārua without sufficient and suitable lands for their needs, which had serious consequences which are felt through to the present,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today we take a significant step towards addressing the wrongs in the past and building a strong economic future for the Ngāti Rārua in the region.”

Ngāti Rārua will receive financial redress of $11.76 million and have the opportunity to purchase Wairau and Motueka Crown forestry land near Nelson. The Deed of Settlement also recognises the strong association Ngāti Rārua has with Wairau Bar and Lagoons, Kaka Point and Te Tai Tapu.

“This government is committed to resolving all historical Treaty grievances,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today’s settlement shows that the Crown and iwi can work together to resolve historical grievances and build an economic platform that benefits everyone.”

The Deed was ratified by the Ngāti Rārua community with support from over 99% of those who voted, and will be implemented through legislation.

Copies of the Deed are available on the Office of Treaty Settlements website [here](http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/NgatiRaruaiDOS.pdf)
