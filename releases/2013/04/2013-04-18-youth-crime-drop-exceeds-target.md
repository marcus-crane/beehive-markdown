Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows says the Government’s smarter approach to youth offending shows a continuing decline in serious youth crime.

Results released today as part of the justice sector’s progress against the Better Public Services (BPS) targets to reduce crime and reoffending, show youth crime down 14 per cent since the June 2011 baseline.

This is well in excess of the target of a five per cent drop by June 2017.

“This Government has taken a smart, evidence-based approach to youth offending, which aims to keep young people out of the formal criminal justice system as long as possible,” says Mr Borrows.

“Our Fresh Start reforms have given the Youth Court and youth justice sector the tools they need to deliver this great result, from additional mentoring and alcohol treatment placements to longer orders to allow us to really tackle serious offenders.”

The measure, which looks at 14 to 16 year olds appearing before the court, is an interim measure, with work underway to develop a replacement measure of youth crime. It is subject to some volatility due to the low numbers of young people appearing before the courts.

“Young people appearing before the courts represent only the most serious of youth offending. To have made such significant inroads into these hard-core young offenders is a huge achievement, and I congratulate Police, Child Youth and Family, and the many community and non-government groups across the youth justice sector who have delivered this success,” says Mr Borrows.
