Leader of the House Gerry Brownlee will travel to London to represent New Zealand at the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

“The passing of Baroness Thatcher is an enormously sad time for her family – our thoughts are with them, and the people of Britain,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Baroness Thatcher was one of the most remarkable and influential politicians of our time and will be remembered as a strong and determined leader.

“Her leadership was transformational, positively impacting countries beyond her own, and leaving an enduring legacy in economic and political thinking across the globe,” Mr Brownlee says.

Baroness Thatcher’s funeral will be held at Saint Paul’s Cathedral, London, on Wednesday 17 April.

“I am greatly honoured to be representing New Zealand at the service, which will mark the life and work of a remarkable woman,” Mr Brownlee says.
