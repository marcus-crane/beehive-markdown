Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the release of new rules on Government procurement that will make it easier for smaller New Zealand companies to tender for Government contracts and provide better value for money for taxpayers.

The new rules are the culmination of a major reform programme the Government launched in 2009 to introduce a more user-friendly procurement policy.

“We have consulted widely with the business community, and the message they have been giving us is they want a framework that makes it easier for them to do business with the Government,” Mr Joyce says.

“Government procurement accounts for around $30 billion each year and comprises a significant portion of our economy. This new framework is user-friendly for companies, transparent, and is in-line with our international trade obligations.

“Introducing greater efficiency and transparency into Government procurement will help us deliver on our priority of building a stronger economy and delivering better public services within tight fiscal constraints.”

The new set of rules replaces 44 different pieces of legislation, Cabinet directives, and miscellaneous guidance released by a multitude of Government agencies over many years.

The emphasis will shift from who can deliver the lowest upfront costs to who can deliver the best value for money and other direct financial benefits over the life of a contract.

“By making it easier to compete for Government contracts and making the tendering process consistent across the public service, we expect to make our procurement business more accessible to smaller local firms who previously may have been discouraged by the process,” Mr Joyce says.

“We expect the rules will make a big difference in Canterbury by making it easier for small businesses to demonstrate their capabilities and get on with contributing to the rebuild.

“What Government procurement needs to come down to is who can deliver the best value for taxpayers’ money rather than who is best at dealing with Government officials and this is what these new rules will deliver.”

The new procurement rules start on 1 October and will apply to all Public Service departments, the New Zealand Police and the Defence Force. Other State Sector agencies and the broader Public Service will also be encouraged to adopt them.

**Attached: Questions & Answers**

**Why has the Government changed the Procurement rules?**

The rules have been modernised to address issues creating pain for agencies and businesses, clarify expectations and make them easier to understand and apply.

Previous policy did little to create thinking about how government spending can add value for our country (like developing business capability to contribute to economic growth).

**What impact will the changes have?**

The new procurement rules will improve the way the Government does business with suppliers by making agencies’ procurement practices more consistent and business-friendly.

Businesses will have longer timeframes for suppliers to respond to tenders and more information about planned government procurement projects.

The new rules promote a “value for money” approach to procurement, which means that rather than just getting the cheapest price, government will consider total cost of ownership and other direct benefits.

The new rules also encourage agencies to drive competition and innovation by using more flexible approaches to procurement.

**How will the new rules help New Zealand businesses?**

The new rules will improve the way government does business with suppliers. They’ll get more information about government procurement opportunities and have longer timeframes for responding to tenders. This means they should have more time to put together a response or collaborate with other businesses to submit a joint response.

The rules also promote greater use of model tender documents and contracts, which will reduce time and money that suppliers spend responding to tenders. These changes will be particularly helpful for small and medium-sized enterprises.

The new rules and supporting guidance from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will encourage agencies to seek innovative solutions and award new intellectual property to the party that’s best placed to commercialise it. This should give businesses more opportunities and incentive to develop new products or services that enable them to grow and enter new markets.

Businesses have told us that the emphasis on getting value for money over the whole life of the goods or services will allow better opportunities for New Zealand suppliers, as local delivery and support costs are likely to be significantly lower for them than for international competitors.

**What more could be done through government procurement to help local businesses and create local jobs?**

We want New Zealand businesses to be competitive in both the local market and internationally. The new Rules support this by encouraging open, transparent and competitive procurement practices.

The Ministry is working with a reference group of experienced business people to develop strategies for strengthening local business participation in government procurement. It’s also planning further ‘Meet the Buyer’ events so that small businesses can target their marketing efforts to the agencies most likely to need their products or services.

**Who have you consulted about changing the Rules?**

The new rules were released for public consultation in September 2012. More than 120 submissions were received from government agencies and businesses. Around 70 of these submissions were from businesses.

A second round of consultation was initiated in December 2012, with the Public Service departments, the New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Defence Force, as well as with business and agency procurement advisory groups. The Office of the Auditor-General was also consulted.
