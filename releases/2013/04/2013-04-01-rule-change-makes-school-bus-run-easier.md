A rule change will make the school bus run easier for some parents with children from the same family no longer being separated, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye said today.

“The change increases eligibility for school transport assistance to when a student reaches Year 9 (the first year of secondary school), rather than have a cut-off based on age 10,” Ms Kaye said.

“We found the original rule dated back to the early 1900s. While transport has changed since then, the rule hadn’t. It meant that once a child reached age 10, they were no longer eligible for the same service and we had situations where students from the same family couldn’t catch the same bus for free, even though they were attending the same school.

“Understandably, some parents have been frustrated by this outdated rule and while it is important to note that not all students qualify for school transport assistance, this will make life easier for those that do

.

“The new rule will be in place from the beginning of Term 2, from Monday 6 May.

"I estimate that over 4000 more children will be eligible for school transport assistance as a result of the change."

The new school transport assistance eligibility rule applies to students who are in Years 1-8 and live more than 3.2km from their nearest appropriate school, or in Years 9 or above and live more than 4.8km from their nearest appropriate school.

Eligible students are offered either a place on a Ministry of Education funded bus, or their parents can apply for a conveyance allowance to help with travel costs.
