Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today launched the Chinese language version of the classic New Zealand children’s book *Hairy Maclary from Donaldson’s Dairy*, at an education event in Shanghai.

The Hairy Maclary series, first published in 1983, has sold more than nine million copies worldwide. 

“Hairy Maclary is a much loved character in New Zealand, and he and his friends have helped many Kiwi children to develop their reading skills at an early age,” Mr Joyce says. 

“It’s great that Chinese children will now have the opportunity to go on adventures with Hairy Maclary, Bottomley Potts and the rest of the gang, and I’m sure the series will be as popular in China as it has proven to be in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Russia, Australia and Korea.”

The Penguin Group, which holds the rights to the Hairy Maclary series, has sold the Chinese language rights to Wenhui Press, a Chinese publishing company.  Wenhui Press has produced 10 bilingual (English/Chinese) translations of classic Hairy Maclary stories. 

“This is another example of New Zealand creativity and imagination having global appeal, regardless of the language it is delivered in.  These opportunities help build business relationships between New Zealand and Chinese companies, as well as showcasing New Zealand’s creative talent,” Mr Joyce says.

The book was launched at the *New Zealand and China: Celebrating the Future* event in Shanghai, attended by members of the Prime Minister’s delegation as well as by a broad range of Shanghai business, media, government, education, and other contacts.  The event provided a platform for the promotion of New Zealand education products and services.

“China is a valuable education partner, with Chinese students making up 27 per cent of the international students that came to New Zealand in 2012 to study,” Mr Joyce says. 

“It is great to see our education partnership developing and New Zealand education products being exported to China, as well as welcoming Chinese students to New Zealand to our schools and tertiary education institutions.”
