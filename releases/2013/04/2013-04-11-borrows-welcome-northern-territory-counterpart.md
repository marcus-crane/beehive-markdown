Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows will this week host Hon John Elferink in New Zealand, on a visit to view corrections and youth justice programmes.

Mr Elferink is a senior member of the Northern Territory government, holding portfolios including Attorney-General, Minister of Justice and Minister for Correctional Services.

“These exchanges are an important opportunity to share ideas and learn from our trans-Tasman counterparts,” says Mr Borrows.

“With the huge social and financial cost created by these young offenders, too many of whom go on to a lifetime of crime, we’re always keen to share and examine good ideas.”

Mr Elferink’s three day visit will include stops at Rimutaka and Rollerston prisons, briefings on the Government’s Fresh Start youth justice reforms, and attending the graduation of 11th Military Style Activity Camp (MAC Camp).

“New Zealand has a world-leading youth justice system which is going from strength to strength, with youth crime rates at a ten-year low and still falling. I look forward to showing Minister Elferink some of the improvements the National Government has made to deliver these outstanding results,” says Mr Borrows.
