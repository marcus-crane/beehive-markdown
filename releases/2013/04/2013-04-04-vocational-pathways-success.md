Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata have this morning launched the final Vocational Pathway publications, allowing senior secondary and foundation tertiary students to make more informed decisions about how their learning choices relate to future employment possibilities.

“These publications highlight the areas of learning that different industries value, allowing students to build a profile of learning that includes the relevant skills and knowledge that employers are looking for,” Mr Joyce says.

The Vocational Pathways publications cover five industry sectors; Construction and Infrastructure, Manufacture and Technology, Primary Industries, Services Industries, and Social and Community Services.

The development of a sixth pathway, Creative Industries, is currently being explored following demand from educators through the draft Vocational Pathways feedback process.

“The Vocational Pathways provide a new roadmap for vocational options so that schools and tertiary providers can design programmes that deliver the skills and knowledge students need to move into work or further education and employment.”

“Vocational Pathways provide direction and relevance by showing students how their strengths and achievements relate to a wide range of study options and careers, and the choices they can make about what subjects they will study for their NCEA. They are a valuable tool to plan and develop their future learning and earning,” Ms Parata says.

“Achieving NCEA Level 2 qualifications is a critical foundation of future success. The Vocational Pathways enable young people to identify what they want and need to learn if they want to find work or enter into further education.”

The effective implementation of Vocational Pathways will contribute to achieving the Better Public Services education targets of 85 per cent of young people attaining NCEA level 2 or equivalent and 55 per cent of 25 to 34 year olds gaining a level 4 or above qualification.

The five new Pathways have been developed through a partnership between groups of Industry Training Organisations (ITOs), business, and secondary and tertiary educators, liaising with the Ministry of Education and other government agencies.
