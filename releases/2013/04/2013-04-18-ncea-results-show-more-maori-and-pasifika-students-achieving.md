Education and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed new figures which show more students are achieving NCEA Level 2, particularly Pasifika students.

The final NCEA results from 2012 show that 68 per cent of 16 year-olds achieved NCEA Level 2 last year – up 2 per cent.

They show a 3.5 per cent increase in Pasifika achievement with 52.5 per cent of 16 year-old Pasifka students achieving NCEA Level 2 last year – up from 49 per cent in 2011.

That means 3,054 of the 5,820 Pasifika 16 year-old students who started the 2012 school year had achieved NCEA Level 2 by the end of that year.

The results also show a 2 per cent increase in Māori achievement with 54 per cent of 16 year-old Māori students achieving NCEA Level 2 last year – up from 52 per cent in 2011.

That means 5,857 of the 10,841 16 year-old Māori students who started the 2012 school year had achieved NCEA Level 2 by years end.

"This is great news and a credit to not only the students themselves but to all the parents, principals, teachers and the wider communities that played a role in this increase.

“We know that NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification allows better opportunities for further education, employment, health outcomes and an improved quality of life generally.

“That’s why our Government has set a better Public Service Target of 85 per cent of all 18 year olds having achieved NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification in 2017.

“Seeing these improvements in NCEA Level 2 achievement by 16 year olds augurs well for our BPS target.

“We have set it at all 18 years old because we want to capture everyone, including those students who have not achieved it in school but gained it in another learning environment that suits their learning. The foundation qualification which opens doors to a brighter and better future needs to be in place by the time our children turn 18. We are serious about raising achievement for all our kids.

Ms Parata says it is great to see that these results are being gained across all deciles and all types of schools.

It is the quality of teaching that makes the difference and the strength of engagement between schools and their parent community.

The NCEA results follow provisional ECE data released last week which showed a nearly two per cent increase in the number of Māori and Pasifika children participating in early childhood education.

“Making sure each and every child gets a good education is the most important thing our Government can do to raise living standards and create a more productive and competitive economy for all New Zealanders. To do this, we must raise achievement for all kids.”
