Kaikoura people will be able to see their doctor or midwife or attend an outpatient appointment at a new integrated family health centre to be built on the Kaikoura Hospital site, says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Mr Ryall is announcing the Government has approved $10 million to build the new integrated family health centre and the Kaikōura community is investing $3.4 million.

The new building will replace the existing facility on the Kaikoura Hospital site.

“This is great news for local people. Kaikoura is getting a new health centre to replace the current health facility, which I understand is in a poor condition with some parts of it being over a century old,” Mr Ryall says.

“The new health centre will continue to provide the same primary care, aged care, acute care, maternity care, radiology services and trauma stabilisation.

Mr Ryall says in addition to the $10 million spend, Canterbury District Health Board is also exploring what other services could be delivered at the new centre so Kaikoura patients do not have to travel to Christchurch as often as they currently do.

“Our government is investing strongly in the Public Health Service as we repair the damage of a decade of wasteful spending, endless bureaucracy and a lack of clinical engagement,” says Mr Ryall.

The Minister made the announcement today in the Kaikoura electorate with National MP for Kaikoura, Colin King.
