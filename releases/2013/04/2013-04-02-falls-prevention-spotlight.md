Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the national focus the Health Quality & Safety Commission is bringing to highlight the harm caused by falls.

“The April Falls promotion begins today and DHBs nationwide are planning a range of activities to highlight the danger of falls, which are a serious cause of patient harm,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“Falls in hospitals often lead to patients needing longer hospital stays, with further medical tests and treatment. Some elderly people need admission to aged residential care after a fall.

“The harm from falls can be devastating for patients, and there is also often a significant additional cost to the health system.

“The April Falls activities will complement the strong focus all DHBs place on reducing falls and harm from falls throughout the year.

“For example, MidCentral DHB has put in place a number of practical interventions to reduce falls and harm from falls. These include the use of stickers in patient notes to identify patients at higher risk of falls, education sessions on the wards, and the identification of falls prevention champions.

“In the Northern Region, analysis of falls data in a ward at Whangarei Hospital found that most falls were happening in the morning, around the time patients needed to go to the bathroom. When staff schedules were rearranged so health care assistants started earlier, the number of falls dropped significantly.”

The Health Quality & Safety Commission is working closely with DHBs to help prevent falls and reduce the harm from falls in hospitals, and is supporting those DHBs planning April Falls activities.
