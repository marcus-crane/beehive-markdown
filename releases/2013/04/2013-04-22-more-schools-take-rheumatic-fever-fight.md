More than 12,000 extra school children have joined the government’s programme to reduce rheumatic fever.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the latest schools to join since the start of the year are in Northland (11), Counties-Manukau (18), and Waikato (five).

“The programme targets the most vulnerable and it’s heartening we now have 182 schools and nine community-based clinics taking part,” Mr Ryall says.

The National-led Government’s $24 million Rheumatic Fever Prevention Programme is one of the Prime Minister's Better Public Service targets to support vulnerable children. It aims to reduce the incidence of rheumatic fever by two-thirds to 1.4 cases per 100,000 people by June 2017.

“This government is putting in the hard work to finally begin to turn around the situation with this third world disease. Preventing rheumatic fever was a government priority from 2001 but little had been done, and the incidence rate of the disease just kept climbing.”

Mr Ryall says provisional data from 2012 suggests hospitals are seeing fewer patients with acute rheumatic fever, although it’s too early to confirm a trend.

By the middle of this year around 50,000 children will be part of the Rheumatic Fever Prevention Programme, in Northland, South Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua, Gisborne, Hawke's Bay and Porirua.

As well as sore throat swabbing and follow-up antibiotic treatment if needed, programmes are also working with local services to address other common health issues such as skin infections, healthy housing and insulation.
