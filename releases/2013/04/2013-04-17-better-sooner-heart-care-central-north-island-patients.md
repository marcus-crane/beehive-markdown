The government wants heart patients to get better, sooner care. And that’s why wait-times for tests have been slashed and the length of hospital stay reduced for patients with severe chest pain in the central North Island, says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“This is a real improvement in the quality of care patients receive.

“Data shows that 18 months ago only 33% of people in the central North Island were receiving an angiogram within 72 hours of presenting with serious chest pain – one of the lowest intervention rates in the country. Now, 70% or more patients regularly receive an angiogram within 72 hours – important because this medical imaging enables blood vessels and the heart to be viewed.”

Mr Ryall says the improvement is due to a partnership between the New Zealand Cardiac Network and the five Midland DHBs - Bay of Plenty, Lakes, Tairawhiti, Taranaki and Waikato.

Dr Gerry Devlin, Clinical Chair of the Midland Regional Network says chest pain is a key indicator of a pending heart attack and prompt diagnosis can make all the difference in stopping this serious medical event.

“One of the challenges in reducing the delay is between being admitted to a local hospital and receiving specialist care. The delay can be especially significant when a transfer between hospitals is required,” Dr Devlin says. 

The Midland Acute Coronary Syndrome Projectfocused on ensuring patients who have serious heart symptoms are assessed promptly and at least 70% of those who should under-go an angiogram receive this within three days. Also those assessed as lower-risk receive further evaluation within 48 hours of presenting with symptoms.

“Previously, high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients have been waiting a week or more for transfer from their regional hospital to Waikato Hospital for treatment. Today, if a patient is waiting in a regional hospital for any more than two days their doctor is on the phone,” Dr Devlin says.

“Patients who present with acute chest pain need to be managed with the same urgency whether they present to regional or tertiary hospitals like Waikato,” Dr Devlin says. 

Mr Ryall commended Midland DHBs for having achieved faster, better care for patients through innovative changes in clinical practice. Changes include improving patient flow such as preparation for tests while awaiting hospital transfer and the establishment of a 10-bed ‘Medihotel’ at Waikato Hospital's Hilda Ross House to accommodate stable heart patients, helping free-up beds for acute hospital patients.

“This is exactly the approach we need to work towards in our public health services. We are now considering how these achievements can best be replicated in other areas,” Mr Ryall says.
