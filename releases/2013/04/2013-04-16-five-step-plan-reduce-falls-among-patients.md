A new plan focusing on preventing patient falls has been welcomed by Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew during the month-long April Falls promotion.

Canterbury District Health Board’s five-step plan involves developing falls prevention strategies for patients both while they’re in hospital and when they’re back in the community. Involving patients and their families in the strategies is an important part of the plan.

“Each week, there are about 40 falls-related visits to the Christchurch emergency department by people over the age of 75. Older people who are admitted to hospital are at risk of having another fall, which may mean they have to go into aged residential care rather than return to their own homes. The five-step plan aims to prevent subsequent falls for this group of people,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This plan is just one example of the great work DHBs are doing throughout the year to focus efforts on reducing falls and harm from falls.”

DHBs around the country are raising awareness about preventing falls and reducing harm from falls as part of this month’s April Falls promotion, with support from the Health Quality & Safety Commission.

Canterbury DHB developed and implemented its five-step plan to reduce falls after analysing the results of a study which reviewed 233 falls at The Princess Margaret Hospital in Christchurch over a four-month period to the end of July 2012.

The plan focuses on the need to play close attention to the risks patients face from falls while in hospital care.

The plan’s five steps are:

- ask patients if they have had a fall at home over the past year
- assess patients’ risk of falling in hospital
- put falls prevention strategies in place to prevent a fall in hospital
- discuss these strategies with patients and their families
- discuss falls management strategies with patients and their families for when patients are able to return to the community.

“It is inspiring to see the efforts made by staff to keep older people safe, both in hospital and when they are back in their own homes,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Health Quality & Safety Commission is working in partnership with the Accident Compensation Corporation, Ministry of Health, DHBs, aged residential care, home health care providers and falls researchers on preventing falls and reducing harm from falls.
