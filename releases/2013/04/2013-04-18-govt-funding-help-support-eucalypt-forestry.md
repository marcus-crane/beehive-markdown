Associate Minister for Primary Industries Jo Goodhew has announced that two projects focusing on eucalypts have been approved for Sustainable Farming Fund grants.

“The Government is investing in the development of eucalypts as a foresting option,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“Eucalypts offer a useful planting option. They are an alternative landuse for dryland areas and produce a naturally durable timber product.”

A project being run by the NZ Dryland Forests Initiative to share information about how to effectively manage plantations of durable eucalypts in dryland areas will receive SFF funding of $216,000.

The New Zealand Farm Forestry Association will investigate a cost-efficient method to improve sawn timber recovery from young small-diameter pruned logs of *Eucalyptus nitens* (Shining gum), a eucalypt which has been widely planted in the South Island. This project will receive $11,000 of SFF funding.

“It’s very pleasing to see these groups working with landowners to help them get the best results from their plantings,” said Mrs Goodhew.
