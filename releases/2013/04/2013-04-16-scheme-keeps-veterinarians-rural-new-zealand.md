Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy has welcomed 30 new vets onto the 2013 intake of the Rural Veterinary Bonding Scheme.

“The scheme is now in its fifth year and is making real headway in tackling the rural vet shortage,” says Mr Guy.

“Since the start of the scheme in February 2009, 136 new vets have joined and the retention rate is an outstanding 96%.

“The scheme is a solid incentive, helping to make rural practices more attractive to junior vets who might otherwise end up in city clinics or heading overseas.

“Livestock farming is the engine room of New Zealand’s economy. We export around $30 billion in primary sector exports a year and we want to double that by 2025. That’s not going to happen without practically skilled, dedicated rural vets who provide animal health advice.

“These vets are now practicing in rural areas, and being supported and mentored by senior vets in their practices.”

The scheme is open to newly qualified veterinarians from Massey University who have secured jobs in rural practices working with farm animals.

At the end of their third year of employment they are entitled to a $33,000 payment, and additional payments of $11,000 at the end of their fourth and fifth years.
