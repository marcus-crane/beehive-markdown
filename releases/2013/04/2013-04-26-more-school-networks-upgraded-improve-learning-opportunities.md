Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a further 80 schools are being invited to upgrade their IT networks so they can increase digital learning and teaching opportunities.

“The 80 schools will take the number of schools that are part of the Ministry of Educations’ School Network Upgrade Project (SNUP) to just over 1400, which is more than half of all eligible state and state-integrated schools,” Ms Kaye said.

SNUP upgrades the wiring infrastructure and internal data networks of schools.

“I am currently working with the Ministry of Education to see if we can increase the rollout rate and broaden the scope of SNUP upgrades,” Ms Kaye said.

“Today I am also releasing the results of the *School ICT Infrastructure Survey.* It is clear from the survey that schools are keen to take up opportunities for network upgrades.

“Indications are that while most schools are already embracing digital learning, they want to upgrade their internal networks through SNUP to ensure service quality is retained as technology demands increase.

“Key survey findings include that the majority of schools surveyed use some form of wireless internet (91 per cent); nearly one-third of schools have more than one device per two students (27 per cent); and nearly one-quarter of schools have, or will have, a ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) programme.

“The infrastructure survey looked at the ICT infrastructure in 600 schools, including how they are using technology and what they would find valuable in terms of content and services to enhance learning and teaching.

“This Government wants school networks to support teachers and learners to use and share information and enable 21st century learning practices.

“While there is still a huge programme of work to equip schools with the digital infrastructure to use technology for 21st Century learning, these are encouraging results. The survey will further inform our actions as we create 21st Century learning environments in all our schools.”
