Labour Minister Simon Bridges is calling for nominations to an establishment board to oversee the formation of a new workplace health and safety agency announced by the Government in February.

The new agency, in the form of a Crown agent, is a key recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy.

“The Crown agent will enforce workplace health and safety regulations and work with employers and employees to promote and embed good health and safety practices,” says Mr Bridges.

“I anticipate the establishment board will be made up of members with strong governance experience and expert knowledge of workplace health and safety issues. The members will be responsible for setting the strategic direction of the new entity which will be dedicated to addressing New Zealand’s workplace fatality and serious injury rates.”

Mr Bridges says the establishment board is expected to be in place by July and it will oversee the work needed for a smooth transition of health and safety functions from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to the Crown agent.

The Crown agent is expected to be in place by December.
