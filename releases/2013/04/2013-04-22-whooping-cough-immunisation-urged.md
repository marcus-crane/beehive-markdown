Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew is using Immunisation Week (22 to 28 April) to urge parents to get their children immunised on time.

The current outbreak of whooping cough should underline the importance of on-time immunisation,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“On-time immunisation is vital to protect those most vulnerable to the disease, especially babies under the age of one.”

“There have been more than 8,600 cases of whooping cough since the outbreak began in August 2011. There is no sign of the number of whooping cough cases reducing.”

Outbreaks of whooping cough are also occurring in a number of other countries including Australia, England and Wales and the United States. Outbreaks usually occur at three to five year intervals, and last from two to five years. The last two outbreaks in New Zealand were from 1999 to 2001, and 2004 to 2005.

“All babies and children are eligible for free immunisations against whooping cough at six weeks, three months and five months old. All children also receive free boosters at four and 11 years of age,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Babies need to have had all three immunisations to be fully protected, so the longer that immunisations are delayed the more chance they have of catching the disease.

“Babies who are not immunised are at higher risk of ending up in hospital with whooping cough. More than half of the hospitalisations for whooping cough have occurred in babies under one year old.”

The current immunisation health target focuses on timeliness of immunisation and aims to have 85 per cent of eight month olds fully immunised by June 2013, 90 per cent by June 2014 and 95 per cent by December 2014.

“DHBs are already well on the way to achieve the target and, as at the end of December 2012, 89 per cent of eight month olds were fully immunised. I congratulate DHBs for this excellent progress, however sustained effort will still be needed to achieve the 95 per cent goal,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Another protection for babies is that from 1 January 2013 pregnant women have also been able to be immunised for free between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Partners and other close family members could also consider being immunised.

“In 2009, we also introduced free whooping cough vaccines for frontline health workers who are in close contact with newborns and young babies.”
