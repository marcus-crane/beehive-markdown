Commerce Minister Craig Foss and Australia’s Minister for Industry and Innovation Greg Combet have signed an arrangement to establish a new trans-Tasman patent attorney regime.

The trans-Tasman arrangement will deliver better outcomes for patent attorneys and innovators by providing consistent qualification requirements and professional standards in both Australia and New Zealand.

The arrangement covers patent attorney registration, governance and discipline and is based on the application of Australia’s existing patent attorney regime to New Zealand.

“A joint regime benefits patent attorneys on both sides of the Tasman. The new arrangement will help minimise duplication, reduce administration costs and make it simpler to apply for intellectual property rights in Australia and New Zealand. This will help innovators access both markets and make their products and services more readily available,” says Mr Foss.

The trans-Tasman patent attorney regime is part of a suite of intellectual property initiatives being pursued under the Single Economic Market agenda.

“This is a timely step forward during the 30-year anniversary of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement,” says Mr Foss.
