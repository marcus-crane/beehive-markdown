Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse says the Immigration Amendment Bill, that passed second reading tonight, is part of a package to disrupt, deter and manage a potential mass arrival of asylum seekers to New Zealand.

“The Government has been saying for a long time now that it is a matter of when – not if – a mass arrival to New Zealand occurs,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“The landing in Western Australia last week of a boat from Sri Lanka, with occupants saying they wish to come to New Zealand and flying a New Zealand flag, clearly demonstrates and reinforces this fact.

“The Opposition says there is no chance that a boat could make it to New Zealand, which is frankly staggering. Boats from South-East Asia have already reached Canada so our relative geographic isolation doesn’t make us immune.

“The Government is busy preparing for an incident before it occurs. We have a duty to ensure that we do everything we can to deter smugglers from sending asylum seekers on the dangerous journey to New Zealand.”

Mr Woodhouse says people smugglers put the lives of vulnerable people, including children, at risk in exchange for profit, and they will not be tolerated by New Zealand authorities.

“Since 2009, more than 600 people are known to have lost their lives on their way to seeking asylum in Australia alone. I make no apologies that these measures are in part designed as a deterrent.”

Mr Woodhouse says he will be introducing an amendment at committee stage to strengthen the ability of the Crown to prosecute people smugglers.

The Bill contains amendments to the Immigration Act 2009 that will:

•           Establish a definition of ‘mass arrival’ in the Act

•           Introduce new detention arrangements for mass arrival groups

•           Allow regulations to be made to suspend visa processing of particular asylum claims

•           Ensure the efficient processing of asylum claims and subsequent appeals.

Supporting changes to Immigration Instructions will include limits on family reunification and reassessment of a claimant’s refugee status after three years before the person can apply for permanent residence. 

Immediate family would be able to be sponsored once the person is approved residence but extended family would be ineligible to be sponsored.

“The Government is acting firmly and decisively to deter a mass arrival and manage one if it does happen, but I want to reiterate that the legislation is not about punishing people with a genuine claim for refugee status.”
