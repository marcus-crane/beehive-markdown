Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced a $150,000 grant to the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association (RSA).

Mr Woodhouse is currently in New Caledonia with a large contingent of veterans to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the War in the Pacific.

“I am very pleased to confirm this extra support for the RSA, and it is timely as New Zealanders get ready to commemorate the service and sacrifice of our veterans on Anzac Day.

“This grant will help the RSA support our veterans though district welfare activities, including organising visits from welfare officers to veterans, assisting veterans to attend medical appointments, and other services.

“New Zealand owes a great debt to our veterans and the Government is delivering on its election promise to better recognise and support our veterans and ex-servicemen. This funding to the RSA is another example of this.”

The grant follows the announcement of a 5 per cent increase from 1 April that is benefitting nearly 17,000 New Zealanders on the War Disablement Pension and Surviving Spouse Pension, Mr Woodhouse says.

“The RSA do a great job supporting those who have made sacrifices for our country, and it is very pleasing to be able to help them continue this work.”
