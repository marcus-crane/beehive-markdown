Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of Neale Faulkner to the Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board.

The board oversees the licensing and professional discipline of cadastral (land title) surveyors.

“Mr Faulkner has been a registered cadastral surveyor for 24 years, and is currently a director at Yeomans Survey Solutions Limited. I have no doubt he will make a valuable contribution to the board,” Mr Williamson says.

The rest of the Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board will consist of existing members, who have been reappointed for a further three years:

- Brett Gawn, who has extensive survey experience in New Zealand and overseas;
- Vicki Nalder, an executive and office manager for the Blenheim Aurecon office with more than 30 years in the surveying profession;
- Tony Nikkel, owner and managing director of Nikkel Surveying Limited;
- Merryn Maguire, who has 22 years in the survey profession;
- Felicity Price, a company director with experience in business, governance, public relations and charitable organisations;
- Marion Miller, a former chair of the Southland Regional Council, and currently chair of the Energy Efficiency Trust.

“Together, the members of the Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board allow New Zealanders to have certainty in the quality of cadastral survey and of their land titles.”
