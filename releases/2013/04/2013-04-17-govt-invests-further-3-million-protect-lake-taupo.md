Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced the Government will invest a further $3 million to ensure the long-term protection of Lake Taupō’s water quality.

“Lake Taupo has significant economic, cultural and environmental value for New Zealanders. It is important that we continue to restore the lake’s water quality so that people can make the most of this unique environment in the years to come,” Ms Adams says.

The Lake Taupō work programme to date has been successful in getting land owners to change farming practices and significantly reduce the amount of nitrogen getting into the lake.

The extra funding will be used to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in nitrogen in the lake. High nitrogen levels in lakes and rivers can harm micro-organisms and cause algal blooms.

In total, the Government has committed $35.5 million to ensuring the long-term protection of Lake Taupō’s water quality. Together with money provided by Environment Waikato and Taupo District Council, this forms a joint fund of $75.4 million.

“Improving freshwater quality and the way freshwater is managed is a priority for the Government.

“Freshwater is one of New Zealand’s most valuable assets and its importance – both to our economy and the environment – cannot be overstated.

“On an international scale, New Zealand’s water quality is still among the very best, but we do not shy away from the fact that the quality has been declining in some of our lakes and rivers over many decades, and we must address this.

“That is why the Government has committed substantial funding towards cleaning up our most iconic waterways.

“The National-led government has already invested $101 million since taking office in 2008 into cleaning up historic pollution from our waterways – five times more than the previous Labour/Greens government in the preceding four years.”
