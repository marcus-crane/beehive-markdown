Labour is fast becoming the Anti-Growth Party by pursuing polices that would hurt households and damage the New Zealand economy, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“What has become increasingly clear is that intentionally or unintentionally, Labour is promoting policy ideas that would stunt New Zealand’s growth. On top of that they are opposed to all initiatives that would create jobs and boost incomes. They are becoming the ‘Anti-Growth’ Party’,” Mr Joyce says, speaking today at the National Party’s Mainland Regional Conference in Hanmer Springs.

“They want to introduce a capital gains tax on every business and farm, print money to lower the dollar, force households to pay an extra $500 a year under the ETS and spend and borrow more money. In their rush to appeal to the political left and scratch every political itch, they are ignoring the economic impact of their ideas.

“Their latest ‘plan’ on electricity is playing politics with the value of New Zealand’s economic assets and they don’t care who it affects. They clearly haven't thought through the consequences of discouraging investment and savings to both KiwiSavers and jobs, all for a policy that pretty much everyone agrees won’t work.

“It is becoming obvious that under the influence of Grant Robertson and David Parker – and the threat of the Greens – Labour has shifted further to the left. More middle-of-the-road MPs like Shane Jones are now isolated and forced to recite the new anti-growth party mantra of saying ‘no’ to every idea to boost growth.”

Anti-growth Labour policies include:

- Dramatically increasing the effects of the ETS on trade-exposed businesses and New Zealand households
- Introducing a capital gains tax on all productive businesses
- Abandoning sensible monetary policy in an attempt to force down the value of the New Zealand dollar
- Nationalising the power industry and discouraging investment in the New Zealand economy
- Borrowing more money rather than having the Government make savings and get back into surplus

Policies Labour has rejected that will boost investment and growth include:

•        Resource management law changes to speed up investment decisions

•        Plans to build an International Convention Centre in Auckland (despite supporting a similar arrangement in 2002)

•        Oil and gas exploration on the North Island’s East Coast

•        Investment by Chinese companies, including the investment by Haier in Fisher & Paykel Appliances

•        Encouraging more international investment generally

•        Reforms to allow greater aquaculture development in the Marlborough Sounds

•        Speeding up Bathurst Resources consents at Denniston

•         Increasing irrigation and agricultural intensification

“The National-led Government is encouraging more investment in New Zealand as we know that nothing creates jobs and grows incomes for New Zealand families better than business growth,” Mr Joyce says.

“Labour has talked a lot in the last four years about savings, jobs and growth.  If they are serious about those things they need to start showing it. They need to support sensible initiatives that will encourage investment, create jobs and help New Zealand families get ahead.

“Constantly adopting policies that discourage investment, and also saying ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’ shows Labour is fast becoming the Anti-Growth Party, joining the already anti-growth Greens on the far left of New Zealand politics.”
