Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission Gerry Brownlee has today approved a restricted return to business for the EQC after confirmation that all necessary steps are being taken to protect customer privacy.

This comes after EQC staff worked over the Easter weekend with a team from the office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Colin MacDonald.

Mr Brownlee says he has given the go ahead for EQC’s claims settlement system and functions that allow the Commission to pay contractors in the Canterbury Home Repair Programme to resume.

“Other functions will return progressively over the days ahead, subject to EQC and the Government Chief Information Officer’s confirmation that systems to protect privacy are appropriate and robust,” Mr Brownlee says.

“In the meantime an internal audit is taking place with all staff reviewing locally stored files and protecting material as necessary.

“EQC is also identifying how best to manage the large spreadsheets required to document their work programme; and they are working with professional third parties such as private insurers and contractors on how to ensure EQC data is transferred in a manner that protects privacy.”

Until these things are done and normal functions are returned:

- Claims processing will be delayed, including claims payments

<!--THE END-->

- Online forms, such as the query form, Official Information Act request form, and the complaints form are down

<!--THE END-->

- EQC staff cannot email customers (but customers can email them, and emails will be addressed by other means or as soon as full functionality is resumed)

“I want to thank the office of the Government Chief Information Officer for moving so swiftly to ascertain the extent of any issues EQC may have and address them, and those staff who dropped everything to work over Easter – I’m confident that work will see EQC up and running as quickly and securely as possible.

“Most of all I want to thank the thousands of people with EQC claims for bearing with us since Thursday and over the days ahead as we work to ensure your personal information is as well protected as you would expect it to be,” Mr Brownlee says.
