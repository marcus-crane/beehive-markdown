Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce yesterday announced the establishment of a senior science and innovation representative in China.

Mr Joyce announced the new position following bilateral talks between Prime Minister John Key and new Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

“This move is part of New Zealand’s commitment to upgrade its diplomatic presence in China. It follows on from the recent announcement we will open a new Consulate-General in western China, and add additional Education NZ staff in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Science and Innovation Counsellor will act as New Zealand’s science and innovation advocate in China.

“They will promote New Zealand’s reputation as a smart nation to the Chinese science community, and they will help build closer relationships between researchers, businesses and government agencies in both countries.

“This is the third region where New Zealand has appointed a science and innovation counsellor, with the other two based in the United States and Europe since 2004.

“New Zealand already has a number of other counsellor positions based in China covering education, agriculture, customs, police, investment, immigration and the economy. This reflects the importance of the relationship between our two countries.”

Mr Joyce is currently accompanying the Prime Minister on an official visit to China. The announcement is part of a wide range of initiatives aimed at expanding bilateral ties.

“China’s rapid growth as a major global science and research player is very impressive,” Mr Joyce says.

“In recent years our researchers and innovators have increasingly engaged with Chinese counterparts. The time is now right to expand and help take these relationships to another level by appointing a dedicated China-based official.”

A recruitment process is now underway for the position and the appointee is expected to be on the ground by the end of the year.

The position will be based in Beijing where central government and large players in China’s science system are located. The position will initially be for a three-year term.
