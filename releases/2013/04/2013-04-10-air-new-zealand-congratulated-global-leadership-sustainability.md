Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain has congratulated Air New Zealand on the airline’s latest global award.

“Air New Zealand has been named the winner in the Global Tourism Business category at the 2013 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards. This reflects Air New Zealand’s strong commitment to sustainability and their contribution to our country’s 100% Pure brand,” says Mr Tremain.

“This award shows that Air New Zealand is punching above its weight internationally and leading the way for sustainable air travel.

“It also recognises Air New Zealand’s dedication to sustainability through initiatives such as their partnership with the Department of Conservation to promote New Zealand’s Great Walks and support biodiversity projects.

“Air New Zealand staff and management can rightfully feel very proud, and I congratulate them for the innovative leadership that has resulted in this award.”
