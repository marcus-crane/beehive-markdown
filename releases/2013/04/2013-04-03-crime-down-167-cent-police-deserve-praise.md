Police Minister Anne Tolley says the New Zealand Police deserve huge credit for the fact that crime is down 16.7 per cent over the past three years, and Labour should cease their constant attempts to undermine this great work.

Crime has fallen for the third year running and offences are at a 24-year low, with significant drops in burglary, robbery and theft.

“Frontline policing in our communities, and a much greater focus on crime prevention, is making a real difference,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Labour are trying to imply that the rise in pre-charge warnings is contributing to the fall in recorded offences.

“Yet again, Labour is simply wrong and would rather indulge in cheap politics than admit the truth.

“Pre-charge warnings are included in the crime statistics and go on an offender’s record, so they are held to account without tying up our courts with low-level offences.

“The Police don’t deserve Labour’s constant scaremongering, or their attempts to question the excellent statistics.

“Our Police are spending more time out in our communities tackling and preventing crime.

“As a result, crime rates are at record lows, while public confidence in our Police is at an all-time high.

“And that is something that deserves to be acknowledged.”
