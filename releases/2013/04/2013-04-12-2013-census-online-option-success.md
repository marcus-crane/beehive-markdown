Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson announced today that almost two million census forms were completed online in the 2013 Census.

This represents about 35% of all Census forms that were filled out. The Statistics New Zealand target was 35%.

“The uptake of the online option makes New Zealand a world leader in terms of collecting census forms online. At its peak on Census Day on March 5th the system handled 130,000 forms an hour.

“A huge amount of work was put into making sure the online option was secure, quick and easy, and the system clearly delivered on those goals.

“While we have made no decisions about the final shape of the next census, it’s clear the online option will play a major part,” Mr Williamson says.

During the 2013 Census a pilot was run in Oamaru, where people within the pilot area received letters containing internet access codes only. Those people had to request hard copy forms if they wanted them. The rest of the country had forms and access codes hand-delivered.

While results are still being worked through for the Oamaru pilot area, more than 65% of census forms were completed online.

“The success of this pilot will help in planning for the next census.

“In the meantime, Statistics New Zealand now has the enormous job of processing more than 5.6 million forms (online and hardcopy), with the results being available from December this year,” Mr Williamson says.
