Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the International Court of Justice’s announcement that on 8 July it will hear New Zealand’s submission on the case brought by Australia against Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean.

Australia’s case questions the validity of Japan’s so-called “scientific” whaling programme in the Southern Ocean. New Zealand is intervening in the case, which means it is able to put its views on the proper interpretation of the Whaling Convention before the Court.

“I am pleased New Zealand will have the opportunity to present arguments directly to the Court. New Zealand’s Attorney General will lead our presentation at an oral hearing in The Hague,” Mr McCully says.

“As a member of the International Whaling Commission, New Zealand has an interest in ensuring that the IWC works effectively and that the Whaling Convention is properly interpreted and applied.

“New Zealand will continue to work to end whaling in the Southern Ocean.”
