Justice Minister Judith Collins has been invited to study at the prestigious John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and will join its Leadership Decision Making program from 23-28 June.

Ms Collins says the week long course presents a valuable opportunity to work alongside a diverse and accomplished group of leaders from around the world.

“This is a fantastic opportunity I am thrilled to accept. I am a firm believer in the significant contribution continued learning makes to leadership.

“I am very much looking forward to being immersed in what will be a challenging and stimulating learning experience,” Ms Collins says.

The Harvard Kennedy School offers programs for leaders from around the world. Courses bring together experienced professionals and a world-renowned faculty in a setting where the common denominator is a shared commitment to public value.

In the past year, course participants hailed from 126 countries and included 3 ambassadors, 11 ministers, 6 mayors, 10 permanent secretaries and more than 50 United States legislators.
