Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the release of a report into the Performance-Based Research Fund that shows the quality of research in our tertiary organisations continues to improve.

The purpose of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is to ensure excellent research in the tertiary education sector is encouraged and rewarded.

The 2012 Quality Evaluation Interim Report outlines the results of TEOs’ research performance following a quality assessment of their work. It then funds them on the basis of these results. The Quality Evaluation determines 60 per cent of the Government’s PBRF funding.

“Since the first Quality Evaluation in 2003, the number of research staff whose research was assigned a quality category which attracts funding has increased from around 4,450 to 6,300 in 2012. The PBRF has played an integral part in this significant shift,” Mr Joyce says.

“These results allow us to gauge research performance within our tertiary education sector and can be useful for young people both in New Zealand and internationally to make decisions on their study options.

“In order to continue supporting improvement in research quality, the Government has committed to increase PBRF funding from $250 million to $300 million per year by 2016. The Quality Evaluation component of the PBRF will rise from $157 million to $180 million by 2016.”
