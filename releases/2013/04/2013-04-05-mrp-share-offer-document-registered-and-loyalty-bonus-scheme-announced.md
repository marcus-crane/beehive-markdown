New Zealand retail investors in the Mighty River Power share offer will receive one loyalty bonus share for every 25 shares they hold for two years from the offer, up to a maximum of 200 bonus shares, Finance Minister Bill English says.

"The loyalty bonus scheme that I am announcing today is another way to encourage widespread and substantial New Zealand ownership of shares in MRP," Mr English says.

"It also recognises the loyalty of those New Zealanders who retain their shares and contribute towards the country's savings culture."

The loyalty bonus scheme is available only to New Zealand retail investors – not to institutions in New Zealand or overseas.

The Mighty River Power share offer document was formally registered today and from later today will be available for viewing on the [www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz](https://www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz) website from within New Zealand.

A ‘consideration period' has now started and is expected to last for five working days. This is a requirement under securities law to allow the Financial Markets Authority the opportunity to review the document before the offer period officially starts.

New Zealanders can also take this time to read the document and start considering whether they wish to apply for shares. No applications are able to be accepted during the consideration period.

People who pre-registered will be posted or emailed copies of the share offer document once the offer opens, expected to be Monday 15 April.

Around 440,000 New Zealanders registered their interest in the share offer during the pre-registration period that ended two weeks ago.

Mr English repeated today that the Government expects to see at least 85 per cent New Zealand ownership of the company at the time it lists, which is expected to be on Friday 10 May.

The indicative price range for the shares is $2.35 - $2.80 per share, with the final price expected to be announced on 8 May after the retail offer has closed and the institutional offer has been conducted by a book-build process.

The cost of the loyalty scheme will not be known until the offer has closed and allocation decisions are made, but a bonus offer of 1:25 means that the maximum cost will be 4 per cent of the value of shares allocated to New Zealand retail investors.

"We think the size of the loyalty bonus strikes a good balance between promoting widespread participation in the share offer, rewarding New Zealanders who decide to hold on to their Mighty River Power shares, and being prudent with the costs of the share offer," Mr English says.

State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall says the share offer period, during which New Zealanders can apply to buy shares, is expected to open on Monday 15 April. It will remain open for three weeks, with the expectation of it closing on Friday, 3 May, one week before the company is expected to be listed on the NZX Main Board and the ASX on 10 May.

"We know that many New Zealanders are likely to be buying shares for the first time and great care has been taken to ensure that the offer document sets out all the information they may need to decide whether or not they want to participate in the share offer," Mr Ryall says.

"After the consideration period, we will announce that the offer is open and New Zealanders will be invited to apply for shares. The offer period will be three weeks long, so there's plenty of time for New Zealanders to read the document and consider whether they want to be involved."

Potential investors are encouraged to talk to their financial advisors if they want personalised advice.

Mr English and Mr Ryall say the Government is pleased to have reached this stage in the offer process.

"It's worth reminding ourselves of the rationale behind our mixed ownership model programme. We're expecting that it will raise $5-7 billion of capital that the Government can spend on new investments that we would otherwise have to do without, or we would have to borrow overseas to pay for them," Mr English says.

"In addition, we think the companies themselves will benefit from the mixed ownership model.

"We look forward to the FMA completing its work and the offer period beginning."
