Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss says South Island residents have just seven days left to ensure they can keep watching television.

“While more than 90 per cent of South Island households are already watching digital TV, I urge everyone to make sure they’re ready ahead the switch-over next weekend,” says Mr Foss.

The South Island (excluding the West Coast, St Arnaud, and Murchison) will go digital on Sunday 28 April.

“You do not need a new TV set to go digital. Almost all televisions can be made digital ready with a set-top box. If you’re already watching Freeview, Sky, Igloo or TelstraClear, then you don’t need to do anything because you’re already watching digital TV.

"Watching digital TV means better picture and sound quality as well as a greater choice of channels,” says Mr Foss.
