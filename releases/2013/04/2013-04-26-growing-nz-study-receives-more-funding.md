The Government has committed $5.6 million over two years from Vote Social Development to the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal study, led by the University of Auckland.

“The study could provide real value in the future and the Government has continued to support it,” Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says.

The same group of children are followed as they grow up and influences on their development are included in the study.

Around 7,000 children born in Auckland and the Waikato in 2009 and 2010, and their families are participating in the study.

The study aims to provide New Zealand specific information on factors which influence children’s outcomes.

“The Government has provided more than $26 million since the study began.”

Information from the study will be used to inform social policy.

An independent review of the study concluded it was valuable and recommended funding to continue for the next few years.

The commitment in Budget 2013 provides funding certainty over the next two years. During this time the management of the study will transfer to the Families Commission’s Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit.

Total Government funding from 2013/14 to 2014/15 is $6.4 million

A funding review will be conducted in 2014 to identify potential sources of on-going funding for the study.
