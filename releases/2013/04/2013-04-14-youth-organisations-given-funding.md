Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced funding for six organisations offering diverse services to young people.

“I am allocating a total of $59,000 across six organisations providing initiatives ranging from helping disadvantaged youth to giving cultural opportunities to young people in rural communities,” Ms Kaye said.

The money, from the Ministry of Youth Development’s Services for Young People fund, is going to YES Disability Resource Centre ($5000); Phoenix NZYP ($5000); Stage Challenge Foundation ($15,000); Youth Mentoring Network ($10,000); Youth Quest Trust ($10,000); and Young Enterprise Trust ($14,000).

“This money will assist these organisations providing services that include mentoring for young people with disabilities, entrepreneurial and leadership skills development, the performing arts and training for working with young people including those at risk.

“These are all organisations focused on improving opportunities for young people and it is important that we have such programmes to do this.”

The Ministry of Youth Development funds different types of programmes. These include projects initiated and led by young people, projects in partnership with territorial authorities, and programmes and services delivered by community-based organisations.
