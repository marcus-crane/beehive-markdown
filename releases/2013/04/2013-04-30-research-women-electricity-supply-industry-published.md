Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew today launched new research from the Electricity Supply Industry Training Organisation (ESITO) on how to attract and retain more women in their industry.

“This research is a valuable resource to help understand how to recruit and retain more women in the electricity supply industry,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“The ESITO findings are also likely to be relevant for other male-dominated trades.”

The research examined the employment of a cohort of nine female trainee line mechanics and cable jointers employed by Electrix and Northpower. It shows that having a cohort of women and encouraging good workplace culture and practices are vital to retaining women in male-dominated trades.

“The Government recognises the value of increasing the diversity of workplaces and the need to make the most of our current and future female workforce,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“There are opportunities for New Zealand to address skills shortages by encouraging more young women ‘non-traditional’ occupations.”

The launch of this research follows ESITO’s successful launch of Ultimit in 2012. Ultimit is a resource to support the recruitment and retention of women for trade and technical roles in the electricity supply industry.

“Both of these initiatives demonstrate commitment to changing and improving the electricity supply industry workplace,” said Mrs Goodhew.

The research report will soon be available at [http://ultimit.co.nz](http://ultimit.co.nz) and the Minister’s speech at the launch can be found at [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speeches](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speeches).
