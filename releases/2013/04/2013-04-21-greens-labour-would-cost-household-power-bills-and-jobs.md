Claims that households would save money on power under a Greens-Labour Government are demonstrably false, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“When National was elected to Government in November 2008, Labour’s Emissions Trading Scheme was estimated to cost an average family of four around $330 a year based on a carbon price of $25/tonne,” Mr Joyce says.

“The National Government amended the ETS and more than halved the cost to families and businesses. However the Greens-Labour coalition have stated publicly as recently as the beginning of this year that if they were the Government they would increase the price of carbon to $50/tonne.

“This would see a family of four paying $495 extra a year on electricity and fuel; which would more than wipe out any of their claimed savings from their plan to nationalise the power supply.

"They need to answer for their policy inconsistency before making any claims about power savings to the New Zealand public.

“The reality is that under a Greens-Labour ETS – or carbon tax – and the so-called power ‘plan’ it announced this week, households and businesses would be paying significantly more for electricity and fuel.

“And the worst part is that there would be fewer jobs for New Zealanders. As we already heard from firms like JB Were, investment in New Zealand would dry up as a result of government effectively nationalising such a big industry.

“What the opposition either doesn't know, or doesn't want to understand, is that savers and investors in this day and age can choose which country to invest in. This Government is working hard to attract investment and jobs for New Zealanders by applying good quality regulation that encourages competition, new investment and jobs. This sort of policy would do the exact opposite.”
