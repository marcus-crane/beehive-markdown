Minister for Small Business John Banks is encouraging small business owners to apply for the Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships. 

Prime Minister John Key opened the scholarships today and is calling for ambitious executives looking to expand their international management expertise. 

“These scholarships offer an excellent opportunity for small businesses to build their capability and develop skills to help internationalise their business,” Mr Banks said.

 

“Last year 14 scholarships were awarded, which included two small business recipients looking to increase their presence in international markets.  The scholarships cover up to fifty per cent of the course related costs of attending prestigious institutions such as Harvard and INSEAD.”

 

One of the 2010 Scholarship recipients, Marina Hirst-Tristram, from Tasman Bay Food Group recently returned from studying a Global Executive MBA through the University of Sydney.  She encourages SMEs to apply for the scholarship as it provides an opportunity they would not usually be able to afford.

 

Applications close on 27th May 2013.  For more information visit: [www.med.govt.nz/scholarships](http://www.med.govt.nz/scholarships).
