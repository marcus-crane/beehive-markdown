Trade Minister Tim Groser today confirmed that New Zealand had completed its bilateral consultations with Japan on joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations.

“New Zealand welcomed Japan’s interest in joining negotiations which was announced last month. As one of the region’s largest economic players and one of New Zealand’s most significant trading partners, Japan’s participation in TPP would add substantial economic weight to the group. More significantly, it would reinforce the strategic vision we have for TPP, including the agreement’s potential to serve as a platform for wider trade and economic integration across the Asia-Pacific,” Mr Groser says.

In bilateral consultations, New Zealand was seeking assurances that Japan is committed to achieving the ambition that has been set for TPP and could positively contribute to the momentum of the negotiations.

“I met with Minister of Economic Revitalisation Akira Amari today and we had a very positive discussion on these issues, including Japan’s commitment to joining the existing membership to achieve a comprehensive, high-standard agreement, consistent with the statements made by TPP Leaders and Trade Ministers in Honolulu in November 2011. I was pleased to be able to confirm that New Zealand could support Japan’s participation in TPP on this basis,” says Mr Groser.

a decision on Japan’s participation in negotiations still requires collective agreement by all current TPP participants. TPP parties would then need to complete any domestic legal procedures.
