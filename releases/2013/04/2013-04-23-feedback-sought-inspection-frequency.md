Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee is inviting people to comment on changes to the warrant of fitness (WoF) and certificate of fitness (CoF) inspection frequency requirements.

“The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) has released for consultation a proposed amendment Rule, Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Standards Compliance Amendment (No 2) 2013, that implements the frequency changes to warrant of fitness and certificate of fitness vehicle inspections,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This rule amendment will incorporate into the law the changes agreed by Cabinet to the frequency of in-service vehicle inspections, including WoF for private vehicles and CoF for heavy and commercial vehicles.

“As well as saving New Zealanders $1.8 billion \[in today’s money] over 30 years, the changes will modernise the 70-year-old WoF inspection system while maintaining road safety,” Mr Brownlee says.

For most vehicles it is proposed to introduce the new WoF inspection frequency on 1 April 2014.

“However, in order to help the vehicle inspection industry to adapt to the change in inspection volumes and provide for a smooth transition, it is proposed that vehicles first registered anywhere between 2004 to 2008 (inclusive) will receive a 12-month WoF following their next successful inspection from 1 October this year,” Mr Brownlee says.

“In light of these proposals, the NZTA is keen to hear about any implementation or compliance issues that would need to be considered.”

In January 2013, Cabinet announced the following initiatives related to WoF inspection frequency:

- after initial inspection, no further inspection until vehicles are three years old;
- annual inspections for light vehicles three years and older, that were first registered anywhere, on or after 1 January 2000;
- six-monthly inspections for vehicles first registered anywhere before
- 1 January 2000;
- a greater emphasis on information to encourage New Zealanders to keep their vehicle roadworthy;
- additional Police enforcement activities.

Cabinet also agreed to a rule change to extend the CoF variable inspection frequency range to three to 12 months, from the current three to nine months, with the default frequency remaining at six months.

Extending the inspection frequency range is aimed at encouraging and incentivising transport operators to maintain the safety of their vehicles.

Submissions will close at 5pm, Friday 31 May 2013.

The consultation documents and more information, including how to make a submission, can be found on the [NZTA’s website](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/).
