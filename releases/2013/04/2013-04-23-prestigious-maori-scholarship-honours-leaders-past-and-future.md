Eight outstanding Māori leaders of tomorrow have been recognised with education scholarships totalling $115,000.

Today in a special ceremony at Parliament recipients of the 2012/2013 Ngārimu VC & 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships were recognised for their potential to make an important contribution to their whānau, hapū, iwi and country.

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to Second Lieutenant Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu. The scholarships are awarded annually to commemorate Second Lieutenant Ngārimu and the 28th (Māori) Battalion.

Among the winners of this year’s scholarships are aspiring paediatricians, lawyers, artists, teachers and philosophers.

Associate Education Minister, Dr Pita Sharples says, “these recipients have used education as the doorway to realise their potential. Their identity, language and culture have been critical ingredients in their success.”

“Like the brave battalion soldiers before them, they will go on to make a great contribution to their whānau, hapū, iwi and country. They demonstrate leadership, service, determination and pride.”

“Since 1948 the fund has supported Māori students who want to further their education. Today, it assists exceptional Māori students who are attending a recognised tertiary institution. The Government will do all it can to continue its support for such outstanding academic contributors.”

The scholarships are designed to inspire, reward and support Māori education achievement and success. In today’s ceremony, the scholarships were awarded at undergraduate, masters and doctoral level.

Dr Sharples added, “Māori students and their whānau, hapū, iwi and communities have the right to expect the best and get the best from education.”

“The recipients of this award demonstrate what happens when whānau, iwi, education professionals and communities work together to invest in the education of their young people.”

“The Ngārimu awards have a rich and illustrious history. Like Ngārimu and the Battalion, these winners have shown what it takes to be outstanding, to have courage and to achieve success.”
