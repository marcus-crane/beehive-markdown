Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata welcomes the first Pacific Parliamentary and Political Leaders Forum hosted by the Government today in Parliament. Around 70 Pacific Members of Parliament from across the Pacific region arrived in Wellington last night to participate in the 4-day programme.

“I am excited about this great opportunity where we can come together as Pacific colleagues to learn from each other and share our stories in order that we can build a brighter and better future for all Pacific people across the region.

“I congratulate my colleague John Hayes MP, Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, for administering a fantastic gathering of Pacific leaders in the House.

The Forum is a result of a unanimous recommendation made in 2010 by the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Committee. It encouraged the House to expand its relations with Pacific Parliamentarians by setting aside a week of New Zealand Parliament’s time to host them and focus on “Pacific issues” of concern to both the greater Pacific region and domestically in New Zealand.

The core objective is to promote stronger governance, cooperation and political cohesion amongst new and emerging political leaders from the Pacific region and to strengthen relations with NZ parliamentarians.

“My colleagues in our National-led Pacific Caucus and I look forward to an engaging and vibrant time with our Pacific leaders.
