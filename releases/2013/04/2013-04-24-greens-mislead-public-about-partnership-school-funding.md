Metiria Turei’s claim that Te Kotahitanga funding is being canned to fund Partnership Schools has no basis in fact, Associate Minister of Education John Banks said today.

“Ms Turei’s claim is akin to saying that government environmental programmes are being canned to pay for the Greens’ $50,000 parliamentary funded asset sales referendum. It’s an absurdly long stretch of the bow to connect the two,” Mr Banks said.

“Partnership Schools are a separate initiative to raise achievement for learners who are not well served by the current education system. They will be accountable to the Crown for raising achievement through a contract to deliver a range of outcomes-based school-level targets. In return for this, they will have more freedom over how they operate.

“New approaches are needed if New Zealand’s tail of educational underachievement is going to be tackled effectively. Partnership Schools are one new approach.

“No money from Te Kotahitanga will be spent on Partnership Schools. This is just another instance of the Greens deliberately misleading the public,” Mr Banks said.

The establishment of Partnership Schools is dependent on the passage of the Education Amendment Bill.
