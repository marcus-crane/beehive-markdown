Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew today announced that New Zealand has joined a United States-led international initiative called the Equal Futures Partnership.

“Many women across the world, including in New Zealand, face challenges accessing economic opportunities and participating in political and civic life,” said Mrs Goodhew.

The Equal Futures Partnership aims to improve women’s economic empowerment, political participation and economic empowerment. It targets public and private sector players, as well as multilateral stakeholders and civil society.

“The Government welcomes the convening by the United States of the Equal Futures Partnership. We are committed to continuing to advance opportunities for New Zealand women through our participation in this programme,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“New Zealand’s commitment on joining the Partnership is to continue to increase the number of women in leadership in New Zealand. Achieving more women in leadership roles, both at governance and senior management levels, correlates with better decision making, organisational performance and productivity gains.

“The Ministry of Women’s Affairs will continue to strengthen the evidence base on women in leadership, provide advice to Government and the private sector, and propose solutions for decision makers to achieve greater gender diversity in governance and leadership roles.”

The Partnership was launched in 2012 by former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. The thirteen founding country members were the United States, Australia, Bangladesh, Benin, Denmark, European Union, Finland, Indonesia, Jordan, the Netherlands, Peru, Senegal and Tunisia.

“I am looking forward to working with members of the Partnership to share experiences and best practice and continue to increase women’s political and civic participation and their economic opportunities.”
