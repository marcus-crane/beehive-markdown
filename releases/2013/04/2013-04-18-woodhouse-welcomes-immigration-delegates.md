Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse today welcomed top immigration officials from the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Australia who are meeting in Queenstown for the annual Five Countries Conference (FCC).

“This is the first time New Zealand has been Chair of the Five Countries Conference, which is a great honour,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The FCC is an important Forum where like-minded immigration agencies explore ways to cooperate and work collaboratively to improve the security, service and efficiency of our respective immigration systems.

“We all know it can be a tricky balance in immigration between facilitating travel for low-risk and known travellers and ensuring that opportunities are minimised for terrorists and criminals to travel undetected.

“The FCC has led critical work in this area to share data and resources to attract legitimate travellers and deter undesirable individuals.”

Mr Woodhouse says FCC Data Sharing is delivering faster decision making and enhanced detection of criminality and fraud.

“In New Zealand alone, 1342 people were denied boarding in the past year through Immigration New Zealand’s Advance Passenger Processing system because they did not meet immigration entry requirements.

“Improving the security and integrity of immigration systems is one of the FCC’s objectives and this result is illustrative of the great improvements in this area.”
