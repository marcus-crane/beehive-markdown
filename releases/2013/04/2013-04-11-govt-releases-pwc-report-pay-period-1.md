Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report on complaints and notifications in regards to Pay Period 1 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 1 of the new financial year, which was paid on the morning of 3 April, paid 88,387 people a total of $173.67 million. This was 942 more staff than for the previous pay round, Pay Period 26.

The PwC report shows there were complaints and notifications received regarding 2.14 per cent of staff across the country. 39 staff were notified as not paid, 1647 were overpaid, and 206 underpaid. Affected staff were from 386 schools or 15.7 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“The increase in overpayments was primarily caused by a single software error in which 1480 school staff in 188 schools received an overpayment averaging $65 each. This has led to a disappointing overall result compared to recent positive progress,” Mr Joyce says.

“As part of the remediation work to fix bugs in the Novopay system, a new error was made during a configuration change that meant when the pay went through it triggered an overpayment of voluntary bonding payments to 1480 school employees totalling $92,323.

“The Ministry of Education last week posted a notice on the Novopay website about the error and is in the process of working with affected schools.

“The mistake is a reminder of the challenges in remediating a very complex pay system. I am advised that it was a one-off event that has been corrected. If the result of that single error was removed, then complaints and notifications received would have related to a total 0.55 per cent of staff across the country.”

Pay Period 1 data compares with 0.43 per cent of staff and 232 schools about which complaints and notifications were received for Pay Period 26; 1 per cent and 406 schools for Pay Period 25; 1.9 per cent and 447 schools in Pay Period 24; and 2.2 per cent and 628 schools for Pay Period 23.
