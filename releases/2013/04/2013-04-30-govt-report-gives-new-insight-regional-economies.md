Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today released a new Government report into the economic performance of New Zealand’s 16 regions.

The Regional Economic Activity Report pulls together for the first time in one place the available economic data on all of our regions. It also provides a breakdown at the regional level of some of the specific initiatives the Government has underway under its Business Growth Agenda.

“The report is designed to encourage more debate about what it takes for a region to be successful, and to more clearly link the decisions that are made by local stakeholders about resource allocation and usage to the number of jobs available in a region,” Mr Joyce says.

“It is my expectation stakeholders will want to use it to compare and contrast the economic fortunes of different regions around the country, and ask themselves what lessons and opportunities there are for growth and jobs in their region.

“For businesses to succeed they need to be able to make the most of their local resources, both physical and human. They need public institutions that make sound infrastructure investment decisions, administer fit-for-purpose regulation and provide services that improve local circumstances.”

Mr Joyce says the report will be updated annually and the next report will include a new official measure of regional gross domestic product. This will be produced by Statistics New Zealand and initial data up to 2010 will be available in June this year.

“Nothing creates jobs and boosts incomes better than business growth. For New Zealand to build a more productive and competitive economy, we need all of our regions to achieve to their potential.

“Each region needs to assess its performance and decide whether it is willing to take the opportunities that exist for jobs and economic growth.”
