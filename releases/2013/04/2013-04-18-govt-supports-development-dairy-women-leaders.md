Associate Minister for Primary Industries Jo Goodhew has announced that the Dairy Women’s Network has been approved for a Sustainable Farming Fund grant of $180,000 over three years.

“The Government is investing in the development of female leaders in dairying to ensure the sector is well-placed to face future challenges,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“The Dairy Women’s Network has a track record of linking up and empowering women in dairying.

“The Network has identified the need for leaders to drive reform in the dairy sector so that it’s meeting social and environmental footprint obligations without compromising overall productivity.”

Project Pathfinder aims to build the leadership capacity of New Zealand’s dairying women. Activities will include a leadership and mentoring programme, e-Leadership Development Hubs, and an Individualised Pathway Programme to assist women map their own development journeys.

“I congratulate the Network on being alert to the need in their sector. The Government is very pleased to provide co-funding for this initiative,” Mrs Goodhew said.
