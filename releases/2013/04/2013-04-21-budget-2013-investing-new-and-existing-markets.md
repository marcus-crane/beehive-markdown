Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today released details of Budget initiatives for tourism, including $44.5 million to attract visitors from emerging growth markets and $24.5 million to boost tourism from existing markets.

As part of a larger internationally-focused growth package, the Government is investing an additional $158 million in tourism through Budget 2013 to attract more visitors to New Zealand, particularly high-spending visitors.

“Attracting more tourists from growing markets such as India, Indonesia and Latin America is a key part of the Government’s strategy for tourism. These countries have strong economic growth and increasing numbers of people who have the desire and ability to travel,” says Mr Key.

“Latin America is one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic regions in the world. Many Latin American countries have improving economies and growing trade links with New Zealand.

“Visitor numbers from India have been steadily growing, with almost 30,000 visitors in 2012. Indian tourists tend to visit from April to June, making them an important source of visitors during our autumn season.

“Indonesia is one of our closest neighbours and we saw a 7 per cent increase in the number of Indonesian visitors last year. It is the fourth most populous country in the world with an increasing number of outbound travellers.

“Travellers from these countries are looking for destinations to visit now, and we want New Zealand to be the first choice. Although tourist numbers are growing, we currently have a very small presence in these markets. Our additional investment of $44.5 million will enable us to attract them.

“At the same time, we cannot ignore our strong existing markets. Australia, the USA, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan are traditionally important, and tourism from China has grown exponentially over the past decade. Together these six countries make up almost three quarters of our visitors.

“We have allocated additional funding of $24.5 million over four years to target high value visitors in these markets.

“This will include focusing on the recovery of the Japanese market and extending the Premier Kiwi Partnership programme, which works with Chinese agents to improve the quality of visitors’ holidays to New Zealand.”
