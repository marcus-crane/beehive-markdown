The government is committed to improving waiting times for patients, and in the past four years there has been a big increase in the number of MRI and CT scans performed on patients staying in public hospitals.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says data from the Ministry of Health shows over 25,000 more vital MRI and CT diagnostic scans have been performed on inpatients under this Government.

“MRI and CT scans are important diagnostic tools to help determine if a patient requires an operation. These tests can quickly diagnose medical conditions including brain hemorrhages and spinal injuries,” says Mr Ryall.

“Over 136,000 MRI and CT scans were carried out on patients staying in public hospitals last year – a 34 per cent increase compared to 2008.

“With new technology, increased staffing levels and district health boards working more closely together, we have been able to perform more scans.

“We want even more people to have faster access to these important tests. Over the next four years we’re investing $16 million in new IT systems to facilitate faster access to diagnostic tests.

“As part of the faster diagnostic test project, we have started to collect wait time data for some diagnostic tests performed on outpatients. This data has not been collected before and will show us where we can make improvements.

Despite tight financial times, the Government is spending $14.12 billion in 2012/13 on health – the biggest investment ever. This demonstrates the Government’s commitment to protecting and growing public health services.”
