Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the launch of a New Zealand television documentary series *Dragons in the Land of the Long White Cloud* in Beijing.

The two-part series is intended to screen on national television in China, which has an audience of around 650 million viewers. It will provide a window into New Zealand’s education experience and lifestyle, as well as provide prospective students and their families with information on taking action to study in New Zealand.

The series was commissioned by the Government’s international education agency, Education New Zealand, and produced by renowned production company, Gibson Group. It will highlight the experiences of those considering studying in New Zealand; currently studying in New Zealand; or who have returned to China as alumni leading successful lives.

The documentary series will give prospective students and their families a chance to see what life as an international student in New Zealand is like, and give them confidence in choosing New Zealand as the place for their children to study. 

“We want to show Chinese parents that New Zealand is a great place to send their children. As well as offering courses and qualifications that are globally recognised and well regarded, New Zealand can offer a unique and exciting student experience that sets graduates up for rewarding careers,” Mr Joyce says.

“Taking a snapshot of New Zealand into Chinese homes provides a great opportunity to show what New Zealand has to offer as an education destination. It’s always more compelling when we see and hear people relate their own stories and this series will bring the New Zealand education experience to life.”

The documentary was launched by Prime Minister John Key at the *New Zealand – China: Celebrating a Strategic Education Partnership* event today in Beijing.  The event celebrated the 40 years of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and China, and had a strong focus on strengthening science and education links. 

Mr Joyce is currently accompanying Mr Key, who is leading a large business and cultural delegation on a five-day trade mission through China.
