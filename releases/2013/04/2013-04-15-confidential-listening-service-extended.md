Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has announced the extension of the Confidential Listening and Assistance Service until 30 June 2015.

The Service has been operating since mid-2009 to provide a confidential environment in which people in state care before 1992 can voice their concerns about abuse, neglect, or the way in which they were treated.

This includes people who spent time in psychiatric hospital, health camps, child welfare homes, foster care, and special education homes.

“More than 700 people have shared their experiences with the Confidential Listening and Assistance Service since 2009 and demand for the Service remains strong,” says Mr Tremain.

“Extending the Service through to 2015 will provide the opportunity for the estimated 250 remaining registered and potential participants to have their stories heard."

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has continued to support this service, ensuing funding through the Ministry of Social Development to extend the service.

“The Confidential Listening and Assistance Service has made a real difference and I’ve been determined to help people access this support,” says Mrs Bennett.

The service usually operates as a three-person panel and travels around the country to meet with participants and supporters.  Counselling and other assistance is available for those who take part in meetings.

The total cost for extending the service is $2.546 million over 2013/14 and 2014/15.  The Ministry of Social Development will contribute $1.859 million, the Ministry of Health $0.586 million and the Ministry of Education $0.101 million.
