Almost 90 per cent of internationally trained migrant doctors who took part in a specialised training programme have successfully registered to work in New Zealand.

“Some highly skilled doctors from places like Iraq, Sri Lanka and Russia, have been lost to the medical profession when moving to New Zealand – many people will have met specialist doctors driving taxis some time in the past,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“This programme gives internationally trained doctors the confidence to work in New Zealand and make a great contribution to our health services – it’s a win-win situation.

“Since the NZREX Preparation Placement Programme began in 2011, 33 out of 38 migrant doctors who completed the course, have now passed the Medical Council of New Zealand registration exam.

“This is a great achievement, especially when you consider only around 50 – 60 per cent of all candidates pass the registration exam each year.

“Of the registered doctors, 12 are now practising medicine in New Zealand, 10 are actively looking for work and 6 are doing further training.”

Faina Roberts was a doctor in Russia before moving to New Zealand with her Kiwi husband. When she arrived here 12 years ago she didn’t know anything about our health care system and wasn’t comfortable sitting her registration exam.

Last year Faina completed the course and passed her registration exam, along with her nine classmates. She is now a House Officer in Wellington Hospital and is working towards becoming a GP.

The intensive three month hospital based course was developed by Health Workforce New Zealand and is delivered by Auckland District Health Board’s Clinical Education and Training Unit. There are two intakes a year and each intake takes up to 10 participants.

“This government has had a strong focus on addressing the health workforce problem we inherited. We have a range of workforce initiatives encouraging doctors to work in New Zealand and district health boards permanently employ more than 1000 extra doctors than they did in 2008,” says Mr Ryall.
