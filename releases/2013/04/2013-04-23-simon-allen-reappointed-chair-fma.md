Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the reappointment of Simon Allen as Chair of the Financial Markets Authority (FMA).

“I am delighted Mr Allen has been reappointed. He has been very successful in guiding the FMA through its initial period of operation since 1 May 2011. 

“Over this time, the FMA has gained credibility from the public and the industry and has delivered on its role of rebuilding confidence in our financial markets following the global financial crisis.

“Mr Allen is highly-regarded across both Government and the industry.  With more than 25 years’ experience in financial markets management and senior governance roles, he has the right credentials to ensure that the FMA continues to be an effective financial sector regulator,” says Mr Foss.

Mr Allen has been reappointed for an eighteen-month term, commencing 1 May 2013.
