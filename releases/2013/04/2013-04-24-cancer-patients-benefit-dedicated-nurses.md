The Government is placing special nurses into DHBs to be dedicated nurse coordinators guiding cancer patients through their treatment and follow up care, Health Minister Tony Ryall says.

“A cancer diagnosis can be confusing and stressful and once diagnosed, patients have to negotiate their way through a complex maze of tests, appointments, treatments, and services,” Mr Ryall says.

“Research shows some cancer patients can come into contact with up to 28 doctors, and even more nurses, throughout their treatment.”

“So far twenty-six cancer nurse coordinators are working in hospitals across the country making it easier for their patients to navigate through the system. Nine more will start in May and further appointments are being made every week.

Nurses are in place in Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Capital and Coast, Counties Manukau, Hawkes Bay, Lakes, Mid Central, Tairawhiti, Taranaki, Wairarapa, Waitemata and Whanganui DHBs.

“DHBs have been recruiting hard to find high quality nurses for these key roles.” says Mr Ryall. “I would like to warmly welcome these nurses and congratulate them on the difference they are already making to patients.”

The Government is investing $4 million a year to ensure every DHB has at least one full time dedicated cancer nurse as part of its commitment to provide better and faster cancer services.

In Wairarapa, cancer nurse coordinator Jacinta Buchanan is a single point of contact for clinical staff and patients. Using a specially developed IT application, she can track each patient to make sure appointments and treatments are progressing as quickly as possible, and monitor patients who are not moving as fast as they should along their cancer treatment journey.

Jacinta says, “Cancer can be a frightening experience and it’s my job to make sure the patient is at the centre of the process. It’s good for patients to know there are people in their court looking out for them.”

In Taranaki, Monique Bastin’s first priority has been to make sure patients have support in place when they are referred to a specialist at the hospital because their GP strongly suspects they have cancer.

Monique says, “Patients often don’t remember what is said when they visit the specialist because they are overwhelmed by the prospect of being diagnosed with cancer. I sit in on these first appointments so I can gather all the information from the specialist and clarify and relay it to the patient at a later time.”

She also supports patients who need to travel outside the region for cancer treatment.

“Patients are happy to travel to get faster specialist treatment and expert care, but the speed at which this happens can leave them feeling swamped. I can help them navigate their way through this process.”

In Waitemata, Sandra Sheene is leading the DHB’s new cancer nurse coordinators in a project to improve communication by incorporating special templates into the hospital documentation system that record notes on patients assessments, care plans and progress.

Sandra says, “Cancer nurse coordinators can now document every intervention they have with patients and this can be seen by other health professionals. This is fantastic as it has improved communication.”
