Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced a newly-accredited product stewardship scheme for the reuse and recycling of carpet tiles.

Ms Adams has approved an application from INZIDE Commercial, distributors of Interface branded carpet tiles.

Under the scheme used tiles will be collected from carpet installers and customers at depots in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

“This scheme is an excellent example of an organisation taking responsibility for the products they have sold when they reach the end of their useable lives, Ms Adams says.

"The old carpet tiles will be given a second life, diverting them from landfill and helping the environment.”

Ms Adams made the announcement during a visit to INZIDE Commercial in Auckland today.

Tiles that can be reused are stored ready to be supplied to future customers, or donated to community groups such as the Salvation Army and Habitat for Humanity.

PVC backed carpet tiles beyond their usable life are sent back to the original manufacturer in the United States where they are stripped and remanufactured into new carpet tiles. The company is also investigating the potential for remanufacture in New Zealand.

INZIDE’s product stewardship programme achieved accreditation as it meets criteria required by the Waste Minimisation Act and reduces waste and environmental harm.

Eight product stewardship schemes are now accredited around New Zealand for industries including paint, plastics, refrigerants and waste oil.
