Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the appointment of Tina Symmans to the Takeovers Panel.

Ms Symmans will be appointed for a period of five years.

“Ms Symmans brings a wealth of expertise to the role. Her experience in capital markets and project management will be a real asset to the Panel.

“I would like to also acknowledge the work of Keith Taylor who is leaving the Takeovers Panel after seven years,” says Mr Foss.

Tina Symmans is currently an independent consultant and Chairperson of William Warne Limited. Previously, Ms Symmans was Director of PSIS New Zealand Limited, now known as the Cooperative Bank, Turners and Growers and Director of Corporate Relations, Telecom NZ.

The Takeovers Panel is an independent Crown entity established under the Takeovers Act 1993. The Panel’s functions include: reviewing the law and practices relating to takeovers of specified companies; investigating acts, omissions or practices under the Takeovers Act; and making determinations, orders and applications to the Court in accordance with the Takeovers Act.
