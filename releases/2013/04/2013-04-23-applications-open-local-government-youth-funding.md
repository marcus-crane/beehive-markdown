Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye announced that from today the Ministry of Youth Development will be accepting applications to the Youth Development Partnership Fund from city and district councils.

There is a total of $889,000 for allocation with a minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of $70,000 per project.

“This fund supports councils working with young people to develop the skills, knowledge, and experience to participate confidently in their communities,” Ms Kaye said.

“It enables central and local government - along with the community - to invest in young people leading and delivering youth focused projects.

“The focus is ‘by young people, for young people’.

“There are more than 800,000 12-24 year olds in New Zealand. Investment in their development and their commitment to the community they live in is a Government priority.”

Since the launch of the Youth Development Partnership Fund in 2005, 57 councils have been supported to work with young people. Examples of projects funded include initiatives such as:

- Youth councils undertaking community wide surveys that contribute to Council Action Plans
- Young people leading and participating in volunteering activities
- Young people developing skills and implementing projects and events in their communities for others.

“The fund enables councils to be innovative in the ways they work with young people in their community and bring their voice and influence to local decision-making.”

Applications close midday Wednesday 29 May 2013.
