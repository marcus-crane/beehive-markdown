Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Fiji tomorrow to chair a meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Contact Group (MCG). This will be the first visit to Fiji by the MCG since May 2012.

“The MCG is the mechanism set up by Forum leaders at a special meeting in Auckland in 2008 to monitor developments in Fiji,” Mr McCully says.

“This will be an important visit in advance of the Forum Leaders Meeting in the Marshall Islands in September. Like New Zealand, the Pacific Islands Forum believes in continuing to engage in dialogue with Fiji to encourage acceptance of internationally recognised democratic norms.”

The MCG comprises representatives of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
