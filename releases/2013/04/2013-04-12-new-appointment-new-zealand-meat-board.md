Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy has today announced the appointment of international trade specialist George Rutherford to the New Zealand Meat Board.

The 10-member Meat Board is a statutory body which works to get the best possible ongoing returns from New Zealand’s quota markets.

“Mr Rutherford has dedicated most of his 37-year career to furthering New Zealand’s agricultural trade interests. He has served extensively with the Ministry for Primary Industries and its predecessors.

“Mr Rutherford is a former lead negotiator for New Zealand at the World Trade Organisation, and has played a significant role in trade negotiations with China and the Asia Pacific Region. He has particular expertise on European Union issues, and in the resolution of trade disputes.

“I’d also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of outgoing board member Alan Kerr who has served on the board since 2010.

“The Meat Board manages New Zealand’s interests in a hugely important part of the economy. Meat exports bring in almost $5.3 billion a year,” says Mr Guy.

Mr Rutherford is one of two members appointed by the Minister for Primary Industries. More information is available at
