Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is working with Grandparents Raising Grandchildren (GRG) to discuss support for their members.

Minister Bennett has confirmed an extra $10 million will go to grandparents raising grandchildren and other carers in similar circumstances, as part of the White Paper for Vulnerable Children.

“I was delighted to invite the organisation to work with us providing advice on how best to allocate the extra funds through a Ministerial Reference Group.”

“Thousands of New Zealand’s grandparents and families have stepped in to pick up the pieces; providing love, care and a home for children who have often been removed from their own home following abuse and neglect.”

“I have acknowledged the difficulties facing grandparents, who I admire enormously, and I am determined to help financially,” says Mrs Bennett.

The Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Trust (GRG) has already provided excellent information to inform the process, through a member survey. Suggestions included funding for clothing, transport and school fees.

“I thank GRG and every grandparent who took part in that survey.”

Grandparents Raising Grandchildren will be part of the group providing formal advice for Ministers to consider, to ensure the funding pool is designed to best meet the needs of grandparents.

The terms of reference for the Ministerial Reference Group require it to provide options for extra financial assistance to carers, facilitate ideas from the affected community and provide a report to Minister Bennett in August.

Ministerial Reference Group membership includes:

- Katherine Rich, Chair
- Tracey Martin, NZ First
- Alfred Ngaro, National Party
- Grandparents Raising Grandchildren representative
- Foster care representative
- Iwi representative
