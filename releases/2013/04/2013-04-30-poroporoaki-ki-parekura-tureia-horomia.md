*Poroporoaki ki a Parekura Tureia Horomia*

*Ka tanuku! Ka tanuku! Ka tanuku koa te tihi ki Hikurangi, ka tanuku!*

*Haruru ana te Tai Rāwhiti i te hinganga o Parekura, tangi ana te motu.*

*E te rangatira, kua moe koe i te poho o tō whānau, o tō iwi. Takoto mai, takoto mai.*

*E kī ana te kōrero: ‘Rārangi maunga, tū i te ao, tū i te pō; rārangi tangata, ka ngaro, ka ngaro.’*

*He maunga tangata koe – he maunga aroha, maunga kōrero, maunga o ngā tikanga tuku iho a ngā tīpuna.*

*Haere ki a rātou mā. Haere ki ō matua, ki ō rangatira. Haere ki a Gladwyn mā.*

*E kore koe e wareware, tō āhua hūmārie, tō ngākau māhaki, tō aroha ki tō iwi, ō mahi katoa kia tū rangatira ai tātou katoa.*

*Kua pau tō kaha ki te hāpai i ngā iwi o te motu – kei reira tō rangatiratanga e mau tonu ana i roto i ō mātou ngākau.*

*Haere i runga i te aroha. Haere ki te Pō! Haere ki te Pō!*

Minister of Māori Affairs Dr Pita Sharples tonight paid tribute to his predecessor, Parekura Tureia Horomia, who passed away yesterday.

“Parekura was a great man in every sense of the word, and as a new Minister I had to fill some very big shoes,” said Dr Sharples.

“He had been MP for Ikaroa Rāwhiti since 1999, and was Minister of Māori Affairs from 2000 to 2008. In that time he had advanced a wide range of initiatives.

“Most notably he led the establishment of Māori Television, expanded the Waitangi Tribunal, and restructured the Māori Trust Office to meet contemporary needs. He lifted the funding for Māori Wardens, updated fisheries legislation and supported many Māori development projects.”

“He also had Associate Ministerial roles in Education, Employment, State Services, Economic Development, Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry – all areas that were of huge importance to Māori at those times. His understanding of many of those areas also came from his experience in the public service, especially employment issues. Many Māori and community organisations secured funding from GELS and CEGS through Parekura’s support.

“As a staunch advocate for education he initiated the Hui Taumata Mātauranga where he brought together our great minds to explore educational issues; and he was also a champion for our wānanga, whare kura and Māori education in general.”

“His whānau, friends, and his electorate absolutely adored him. He has touched so many lives, in every corner of New Zealand. If there was a hui, you would often see Parekura there. No fuss, just there supporting the kaupapa – that was just his nature. He was a true gentleman, with not a bad bone in his body, nor a bad word for anyone.”

“His dedication to his people was unwavering. He served his people tirelessly as MP for Ikaroa Rāwhiti for 13 years and as Minister of Māori Affairs in the Labour Government for eight years, and we will miss him,” said Dr Sharples.
