Data which provides information from large district health boards from the 2011/12 New Zealand Health Survey is being released today, says Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

“The survey contains information about smoking, nutrition, access to health care services, oral health and a range of health conditions and other indicators, based on data collected from more than 12,000 adults and 4000 children,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The latest results are being released for larger district health boards, larger public health units and regional groupings of DHBs. Results are only available for areas with sufficient sample size for statistical analysis.

“The regional data reflects the overall national-level findings, but shows some variations between DHBs in the various categories.

“DHBs have different population make-ups, and this can partly explain variations between them.”

The information in the overall survey and the regional statistics will be used by the Ministry of Health, DHBs, public health units, and health providers for planning purposes.

“The government is committed to protecting and growing the public health service and this year we will invest over $14 billion investment in the health sector,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The New Zealand Health Survey data is an important resource for tracking our progress and planning for the future to ensure delivery of effective health services.”
