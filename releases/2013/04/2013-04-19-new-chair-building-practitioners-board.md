Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced David Clark will be appointed chair of the Building Practitioners Board from June 30th.

Mr Clark will replace long serving chair Alan Bickers.

“David Clark, a lawyer of 25 years, has been deputy chair of the Building Practitioners Board since 2005. He has served the Board well and his skills and knowledge of its functions will be invaluable in the role of chair.

The Building Practitioners Board was established under section 341 of the Building Act 2004. The Board’s functions are to:

- approve rules relating to licensed building practitioners
- investigate, hear complaints and discipline licensed building practitioners
- hear appeals against decisions of the Registrar in accordance with the Act.

‘I would like to thank Alan Bickers for his considerable contribution to the Board. He has been chair since the board’s inception in 2005 and has done an excellent job,” Mr Williamson says.
