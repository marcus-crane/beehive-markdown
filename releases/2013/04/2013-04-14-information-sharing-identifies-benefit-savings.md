Expanded information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has already resulted in 525 benefits being cancelled, and will result in savings to the Crown, says Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows.

It is the second major success in a week from the Government’s new welfare fraud measures. On Thursday two people were arrested in relation to a suspected $375,000 welfare scam, resulting from the first interagency welfare fraud investigation in co-operation with Police.

“As at 31 March, 525 people’s benefits have been immediately cut as they are earning above the income threshold and have failed to disclose their full circumstances,” says Mr Borrows.

These cancellations are part of a larger group of 3500 people who are apparently working and earning above the threshold for welfare support that MSD are in the process of contacting.

Confirmed cases are now being processed by MSD to establish how much money has been overpaid and take action to recover that money. Cases where there is deliberate fraud will be prosecuted.

“With expanded information sharing possible now, major savings are being achieved. These 525 people were receiving benefits costing $5.6 million a year – that’s money they were not entitled to, and I’m glad we’ve been able to put a stop to it.”

“The Government is determined to clamp down on welfare fraud, and I’m pleased to see the measures announced in February are already paying dividends.”

“These results are the first of what will be regular monthly checks across 100 per cent of client benefit and income tax records,” says Mr Borrows.

“Beneficiaries know that when they start work, they must advise Work and Income of their changed circumstances.”

“The expanded information sharing between Inland Revenue and MSD means that those people who are dishonest and don’t declare that they are earning income, will be caught.”
