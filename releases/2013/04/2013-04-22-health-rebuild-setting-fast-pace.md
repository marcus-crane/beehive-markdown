Health Minister, Tony Ryall, is welcoming another step in fast-tracking the redevelopment of Christchurch hospitals.

Consultants have been appointed to design and project-manage the development of a new health facility for older people to be based at Burwood Hospital.

“It’s important to keep up momentum on this and other projects in the $600 million dollar-plus rebuilds at Burwood and Christchurch Hospitals,” Mr Ryall says.

The Burwood Hospital Redevelopment project will see a new purpose-designed facility built to house hospital and specialist services for older people.

The new facility is due to open by late 2015.

Mr Ryall says a Hospital Partnership Group made up of Canterbury DHB, officials and others in the health sector, is driving good progress on the projects – enabling the DHB to stay focussed on delivering current services.

“This is part of the largest and most complex health construction works in New Zealand and I congratulate those involved in staying on track to set Canterbury health services back on their feet after the quakes.”

CDHB lost 106 inpatient beds after the February 2011 quake and 200 buildings sustained damage.
