A new computer software purchasing agreement for government agencies is on track to save an estimated $119 million over three years, and has already saved $35 million says Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain.

The deal with Microsoft, struck through the Government ICT Supply Management Office (GISMO) within the Department of Internal Affairs is the first initiative in a wider Cross-Government Software Acquisition programme. The Microsoft deal includes the Microsoft Office Suite and Microsoft Server Licensing.

“The deal is drawing attention internationally for its innovation and licensing models. More than 140 Government agencies have enrolled in the agreement, making it one of the most successful agreements of its kind,” says Mr Tremain.

“The agreement allows agencies to make available their surplus licenses for transfer to other agencies, so rather than investing in new licenses each time, an agency can use licenses from the Government Shared Pool or Clearing House.

“The Software Acquisition programme meets the Government’s objectives to lower ICT costs by reducing duplication, working smarter and delivering better public services. Through the programme smaller agencies will be able to access both the pricing benefits and the beneficial licensing conditions previously only available to large high-volume purchasing agencies.

“The next phase in the programme will involve similar Framework Agreements with other major software vendors. State sector agencies will be surveyed about their current and future needs to inform this next phase.”
