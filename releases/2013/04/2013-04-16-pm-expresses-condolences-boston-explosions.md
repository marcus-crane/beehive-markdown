Prime Minister John Key says New Zealanders are thinking of those injured in the explosions at the Boston Marathon and expressed condolences to the families of those killed.

“Our thoughts are with the people of Boston at this time. We were all shocked to hear of the tragedy that has unfolded this morning,” Mr Key says.

“We are concerned for the people from around the world who participated in, and supported, the Boston Marathon.

“The New Zealand Embassy in Washington, supported by the New Zealand Honorary Consul in Boston, is monitoring the situation closely and liaising with local authorities to determine if any New Zealanders are in need of assistance.

“Athletics New Zealand advise there are 45 New Zealand citizens registered as running the marathon.

“At this stage, we have not received reports of New Zealand runners or spectators being injured. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working with Athletics NZ to make contact with the New Zealanders known to be in the area,” Mr Key says.

New Zealanders who have concerns about family or friends in Boston should attempt to make contact with them directly in the first instance. If they require further assistance they should call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Consular Division on 04 439 8000 and ask to speak to a Consular Adviser.
