Police Minister Anne Tolley says the operational changes made by Police are having a huge impact, with the crime statistics for 2012 showing the lowest number of recorded offences for 24 years, as crime falls for the third year in a row.

"These statistics show that our Police are getting it right, and I want to congratulate the Commissioner and all Police staff for their efforts in preventing crime and making communities safer," says Mrs Tolley.

"The National-led Government has ensured that there are more frontline Police and that they are more visible, spending more time out in our communities tackling and preventing crime."

Recorded crime was down 7.4 per cent in 2012, with 376,013 offences, 30,043 fewer than in 2011. This follows a 4.8 per cent drop in 2011 and a 5.6 per cent fall in 2010.

The crime rate (per 10,000 population) showed an 8 per cent reduction in 2012, following drops of 5.6 per cent in 2011 and 6.7 per cent in 2010.

"Our communities will welcome the significant drops in burglary, robbery, theft, vehicle theft and serious assaults,” says Mrs Tolley.

“A huge amount of hard work from our Police has gone into achieving these fantastic results.

"The National-led Government has delivered 600 additional frontline officers, and Police foot patrols were up 70 per cent in 2012. The imminent rollout of smartphones and tablets to officers will deliver more than half a million additional frontline hours every year, which will be reinvested in preventing crime before it happens.

"So while the statistics from 2012 and the previous two years are extremely impressive, I believe there is much more to come, as officers equipped with the latest technology increase their effectiveness and visibility on our streets.”
