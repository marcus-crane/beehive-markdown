There are promising indications that fewer people are drinking and younger people are drinking more responsibly, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne said today.

A Ministry of Health survey, undertaken in 2011/12, shows 80% of the population report consuming alcohol, down from 84% in the 2006/07 health survey.

All age groups reported falls in the numbers drinking in the past year, but it was particularly notable in under-age drinkers from 15 to 17 years old.

Of those drinking, one in five reported a hazardous drinking pattern, which is defined as a pattern that carries a risk of physical or mental harm, or having harmful social effects to the drinker or others.  

Hazardous drinking rates for males have fallen from 30% to 26%, but were virtually unchanged for women at 13%, compared to 12% in 2006/07

Rates of hazardous drinking among people aged 18–24 years dropped to 38%, from 49% in the previous survey.

Mr Dunne said that while the findings were “positive and a step in the right direction, I want to see them supported from further surveys”.

“There is some good work going on in the sector, and these are encouraging results.”
