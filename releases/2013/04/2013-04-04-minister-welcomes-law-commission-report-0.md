Justice Minister Judith Collins today tabled in Parliament the Law Commission’s report *The 2013 Review of the Evidence Act 2006*.

“I would like to thank the Law Commission for its thorough review of the Evidence Act 2006,” Ms Collins said.

The review builds on the earlier work that resulted in the 2006 Act. The new report provides a comprehensive summary of the evolution and interpretation of the law of evidence in New Zealand.

“I am pleased to report that the Law Commission has concluded that the Evidence Act has overwhelmingly met its objectives,” Ms Collins said.

“The Commission has recommended a number of amendments to improve the operation of the Act. I will carefully consider these recommendations.”

The Government will formally respond to the Law Commission’s recommendations later this year.
