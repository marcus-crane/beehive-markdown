Digital mammography technology is increasing efficiency in breast screening services, which enables more women to be screened, Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

“Five Breast Screen Aotearoa (BSA) providers are now providing digital mammography to more than half the country,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“BreastScreen Midland is on track to also provide digital screening by the end of May and the last two services are scheduled to go digital by the end of this year.

“Digital mammography technology provides a number of benefits that make the service more efficient.

“The quality of images can be checked immediately, which means less women need to be recalled for repeat mammograms. Electronic archiving of images reduces the risk of misplacing or damaging images and allows distant reading of images. And better quality images are obtained for women under 50 and those with dense or difficult breast tissue.

“Digital screening also delivers lower doses of radiation which is safer for women.”

BSA screened 71.9 per cent of the target population in 2012, exceeding their target of 70 per cent, and up from 58.6 per cent in 2007.

“In addition to our $10 million investment in digital mammography technology, the Government has invested in ten new linear accelerators for the treatment of cancer, which enable more targeted use of radiation therapy,” Mrs Goodhew said.
