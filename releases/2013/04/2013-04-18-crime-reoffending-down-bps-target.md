Justice Minister Judith Collins today released the latest justice sector Better Public Services (BPS) target results to December 2012, showing significant progress is being made against each target.

Ms Collins says results show there has been a 9 per cent reduction in total crime rate (down from 983 to 891 crimes per 10,000 people) and a 7 per cent reduction in violent crime (down from 109 to 102 crimes per 10,000 people).

Youth crime is also down 14 per cent (down from 332 to 286 per 10,000 young people) and re-offending is down by 8 per cent.

“I am thrilled these latest results show the sector is on track to meet all its 2017 BPS targets. In the case of youth crime, the sector has already exceeded its target – 4 years early.

“Fewer people are being affected by serious and violent crime, and fewer criminals are going on to reoffend. This is what delivering better public services for New Zealanders is all about.

“Our results show how well the entire justice sector is working together to deliver a safer New Zealand. I would like thank the Ministry of Justice, Police, and Corrections for all their excellent work,” Ms Collins says.

BPS targets for the justice sector are to reduce the total recorded crime rate by 15 per cent, the recorded violent crime rate by 20 per cent, the youth crime rate by 5 per cent and the reoffending rate by 25 per cent by 2017.

Reduction in crime and reoffending is being driven by significant work underway across the sector as part of the sector’s BPS Reducing Crime and Re-Offending Result Action Plan.

Examples of justice sector initiatives underway are:

- Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court – offering defendants with severe substance abuse issues an opportunity to deal with these before they are sentenced.
- There are currently 26 participants in the Court.
- Police Victim Focus - implemented in late 2012 to improve the overall quality of service that Police provides to victims, especially those at highest risk of repeat victimisation.
- Safe@Home – helping families who have been victims of serious domestic violence to stay safe in their homes by providing physical safety measures such as replacing glass panelled doors with solid doors; installing security lights, deadlocks, and door and window restrictors; changing locks; repairing broken windows and damaged door frames; and fitting safety glass.
- The programme has recently been expanded into Counties Manukau, Christchurch and Tauranga.
- Improving the Family Violence Service Response to Police call outs - Police, Child Youth and Family and Women’s Refuge meeting regularly to review and combine information on family violence police call outs ensuring the most appropriate response.
- Expanding education - Corrections and the Open Polytechnic have launched a joint “Get Ahead” programme in prisons and probation sites. Up to 1,000 prisoners and community offenders will have access to free supported learning opportunities for National Certificates in Employment Skills (NCES) and Educational Achievement 1 & 2 (NCEA 1 & 2).

More than 150 offenders have already enrolled in the Get Ahead programme.

“There are clearly some very exciting initiatives underway as part of the justice sector results action plan and they are already making a difference,” Ms Collins says.

The BPS target results to December 2012 are available on the State Services Commission website [www.ssc.govt.nz](http://www.ssc.govt.nz) and further information is available on the Ministry of Justice website [www.justice.govt.nz](http://www.justice.govt.nz).
