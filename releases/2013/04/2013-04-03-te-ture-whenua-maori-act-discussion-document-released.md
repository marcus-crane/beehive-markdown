The government is seeking feedback on five major proposals to streamline the complex rules governing Māori land, freeing its economic potential and strengthening guardianship, Associate Minister of Māori Affairs Christopher Finlayson and Minister of Māori Affairs Dr Pita Sharples announced today.

The ministers have released the findings and recommendations of an expert review panel looking at ways to improve *Te Ture Whenua Māori Act*, *Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 Review Discussion Document*, and are encouraging the public to make submissions on its proposals.

The purpose of the document is to seek views on how best to ensure that Te Ture Whenua Māori Act unlocks the economic potential of Māori land while preserving its cultural significance for future generations.

There are over 27,137 blocks of Māori land under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act, comprising 1.42 million hectares, or around 5% of the total land in New Zealand. It has been estimated up to 80% of Māori land is under-performing for its owners.

“The proposals of the expert review group will contribute to building a more productive and competitive economy as part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda,” Mr Finlayson said. “There is huge potential in Māori land that has been held back by flawed legislation and complex regulation.”

“The propositions seek to provide the appropriate legislative framework for the retention of Māori land while at the same time making it easier for engaged owners to use and develop the land for the benefit of whānau, hapū and iwi,” he said. “The benefits for Māori and the country as a whole are potentially very significant.”

The Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples said that this process will contribute to *He kai kei aku ringa: the Crown-Māori Economic Growth Partnership Strategy and Action Plan*, by looking at how government can support Maori development of this cultural, and economic resource.

“Whenua is a cornerstone of our Māori identity,” Dr Sharples said. “Maori land owners should be supported to develop or retain their resource, in line with the aspirations they have for their own development.”

“There are many Maori land blocks that remain unutilised; that represents a huge potential for economic, social and cultural development for tangata whenua.”

The discussion document looks at on-going challenges, such as effectively providing for the use and management of Māori land in the face of continuing fragmentation of land interests, and the result that 80% of Māori land remains underdeveloped.

The expert review panel’s propositions are:

- Utilisation of Māori land should be able to be determined by a majority of engaged owners;
- All Māori land should be capable of utilisation and effective administration;
- Māori land should have effective, fit for purpose, governance;
- There should be an enabling institutional framework to support owners of Māori land to make decisions and resolve any disputes;
- Excessive fragmentation of Māori land should be discouraged.

The panel will hold a series of regional hui during April and May in areas with high concentrations of Māori land and/or Māori land owners.

The discussion document is available [here](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/in-print/our-publications/publications/te-ture-whenua-maori-act-1993-review-panel-discussion-document/)

Written submissions are due on 17 May 2013, and can be sent to [TTWMA@tpk.govt.nz](mailto:TTWMA@tpk.govt.nz) or Te Ture Whenua Māori Act Review Panel, c/o Te Puni Kōkiri, PO Box 3943, Wellington.

The panel will then develop final proposals and recommendations for the consideration of Ministers.
