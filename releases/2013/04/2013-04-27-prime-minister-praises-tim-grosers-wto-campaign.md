Prime Minister John Key says he has now received confirmation from Geneva that New Zealand’s Trade Minister has not reached the final round of consultations to select a new Director General for the World Trade Organisation.

“This is obviously disappointing, not only for Tim Groser and the Government, but for all those WTO members and people in the wider trade community who were hoping to see him secure this role. We were grateful for the expressions of support from around the world.

“I know that Mr Groser appreciated that support and looks forward to continuing to work for the conclusion of the WTO’s Doha development negotiating round and towards making the international trading system work more effectively for all members. These were shared priorities and they remain so, regardless of the outcome of this race.

“In putting Mr Groser forward for this role, and in the enthusiasm with which he has pursued his nomination, New Zealand has underlined its strong commitment to the WTO and the multilateral trading system,” says Mr Key.

“The candidate eventually selected to lead the WTO will face a challenge in ensuring that the organisation remains fully effective and credible. I want to assure whoever is selected that they will have New Zealand’s full support in this endeavour.”

Mr Key says that New Zealand’s trade negotiations agenda for the coming year remains full and exciting.

“A number of negotiations likely to reach crucial stages, in addition to the WTO Ministerial meeting in Bali in December and I am reassured that New Zealand will continue to enjoy the benefit of Mr Groser’s experience and skills as Trade Minister to progress these initiatives.”
