The Government’s goal of faster care for cancer patients has taken another step forward with the release of best practice guidelines for treating patients with some of the most common cancers.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the new draft tumour standards describe what sort of treatment a patient should receive when they have a specific cancer.

“The new draft standards cover bowel, breast, gynaecological, haematological, head and neck, upper gastrointestinal, melanoma and sarcoma tumours.

“We know these sorts of standards work, because we’ve already seen great results from the development of specific tumour standards for the treatment of lung cancer,” Mr Ryall says.

 “Those 2011 lung cancer standards have improved the way care is delivered to lung cancer patients in many district health boards.

“Since then, we have seen the rise of innovative rapid access clinics where patients with suspected lung cancer can have all the important diagnostic tests they need in one place, at one time. This means lung cancer patients are being diagnosed faster and receiving treatment sooner.

“The standards are part of the Government’s $33 million Faster Cancer Treatment programme which includes extra funding for dedicated cancer nurse coordinators to support patients through the hospital system -  and greater monitoring of various diagnostic tests.

All this builds on the success of the National Health Target ‘shorter waits for cancer treatment’.

The draft tumour standards, developed by clinical working groups including doctors, nurses and consumer representatives can be downloaded from the Ministry of Health [website](http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/cancer-programme/faster-cancer-treatment-programme).

“I would urge health professionals and the wider community to provide feedback on the draft tumour standards. “This feedback process is a critical part of ensuring we have robust standards that are widely agreed and used, so we can make a real difference to the care all patients receive.”

“I would like to thank the clinical working groups for the huge amount of work they have put into drafting these new standards which, when finalised and implemented later this year, will further improve the quality and timeliness of services for cancer patients,” says Mr Ryall.
