As at 8.30 this morning, 100,000 New Zealanders have pre-registered their interest in buying shares in the Government's partial share offer of up to 49 per cent of energy company Mighty River Power.

State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall says there's been strong interest in the pre-registration website and at times the response had been huge.

The website: [www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz](https://%3Ewww.mightyrivershares.govt.nz), was set up to provide information to New Zealanders keen to register their interest in the share offer.

"This compares with the ten days it took for pre-registration to reach the 100,000 mark with the Contact Energy share offer in 1999."

"There is plenty of time before pre-registration ends on 22 March – and there is no advantage in pre-registering earlier."

New Zealanders who pre-register will receive an offer document as soon as it's ready, and may be allocated up to 25% more shares than people who do not pre-register, if demand for shares exceeds shares available.

New Zealanders wanting information on pre-registration should visit: [www.mightyrivershares.govt.nz](https://%3Ewww.mightyrivershares.govt.nz) or call 0800 90 30 90.
