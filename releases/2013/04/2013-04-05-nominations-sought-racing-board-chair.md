Nominations sought for Racing Board Chair

Minister for Racing Nathan Guy is calling for nominations for independent Chair of the New Zealand Racing Board.

“This is an important position as the head of the governing body for racing in New Zealand,” says Mr Guy.

“The New Zealand Racing Board is responsible for the promotion, organisation and development of the racing industry, and also provides racing and sports betting services through the TAB.

“Nominees need to have expertise in business, marketing or economics as well as strong governance skills.”

Mr Guy has written to all three racing codes this week seeking nominations.

The appointment is expected to commence from 1 August 2013. Nomination forms and further details about the Board’s membership, powers and functions is available at [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz)
