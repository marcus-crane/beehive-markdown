Prime Minister John Key has paid tribute to former British Prime Minister Lady Margaret Thatcher, who has passed away aged 87.

“This is an enormously sad time for her family. My thoughts are with them, and the people of Britain, at this time.”

Mr Key says he admired Lady Thatcher as fiercely determined leader, who stood up for what she believed in.

“Lady Thatcher will be remembered as a strong and determined leader.”

During her time as Prime Minister, from 1979 until 1990, she faced some real challenges – from the conflict in the Falklands to tremendous economic changes,” says Mr Key.

“She has left a strong and permanent legacy in Britain. Lady Thatcher believed passionately in what she was doing, and she will be missed by many.”

Mr Key says he had met Lady Thatcher once in Britain, prior to his entering politics.

“I met Lady Thatcher only briefly, and I remember being somewhat in awe of her, as such a well-recognised, well-known world leader.

Mr Key is currently leading a trade delegation to China, and will return to New Zealand on April 13.
