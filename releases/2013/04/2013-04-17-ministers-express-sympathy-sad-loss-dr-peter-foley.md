Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew wish to express their sympathy to the family of Napier GP Dr Peter Foley.

“Peter held many leadership roles in the health sector and he made a very significant contribution. He always put patients first and worked tirelessly to improve services for them,” Mr Ryall says.

Dr Foley was chief medical officer primary care at Hawkes Bay District Health Board, also serving previously as Chair of the New Zealand Medical Association. He was the inaugural Chair of the GP Leaders Forum, and deputy Chair of the Health Quality and Safety Commission since its establishment in 2010.

“Peter was a dedicated and passionate advocate for improving health services, and made a real difference to the HQSC’s focus on putting patients at the centre of its work on improving quality and safety for patients,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Last year he was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to health.

“Peter was a respected and popular leader and he will be greatly missed,” the Ministers say.
