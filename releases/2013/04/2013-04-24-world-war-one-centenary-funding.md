Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced 17 projects commemorating the centenary of the First World War have been granted close to $1.7 million in funding by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board.

“A total of $1,196,533 has gone to support sixteen community projects. In addition the Massey University Foundation has received a grant of $500,000 towards its three volumes of “The Centenary History of New Zealand and the First World War,” says Mr Tremain.

“The commemorations will provide an opportunity for New Zealanders to reflect on the war’s contribution to our character, identity and place in the world. The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board recognises the importance of this centenary event to our nation and has set aside over $17 million to fund community initiatives and projects.”

Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson welcomed the decisions, saying increased attendances at Anzac Day services show a growing interest and understanding amongst New Zealanders of the sacrifices made in all armed conflicts.

“The lottery funding will enhance commemorations for everyone regardless of where they live in New Zealand. The First World War centenary commemorations will be significant and will take place over several years. Projects funded through the lottery grants will sit alongside a wide range of activities and events, including those being organised through the official centenary commemoration programme.”

Mr Finlayson last year established the First World War Centenary Panel to steer an extensive programme to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War.

The Panel provided advice and assistance to the Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee on its decisions.

“The projects brought to the Committee were interesting, innovative and showed a high level of community engagement as well as conserving war heritage items,” says Mr Tremain.

“For example the Tauranga City Council has been given funding to develop a mobile exhibition space using shipping containers. The space will travel to communities and offer them the opportunity to stage local exhibitions.

“Another project that received funding will see Waitaki District’s First World War memorial oaks with their associated crosses and commemorative plaques preserved and renovated to become strong and emotive physical reminders of the sacrifice of local soldiers.”

Mr Tremain said for future funding rounds the eligibility criteria had been expanded to include arts and sports activities, and projects located overseas.

“Broadening the criteria in this way will enable a wider range of community projects to access funding to help commemorate the centenary of the First World War.”

The full list of decisions from the first round will be published shortly. Further information can be found at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz)

**Background**

A decision was made by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board in mid-2012 to expand the then Lottery Grants Board Environment and Heritage Committee to become the Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee.

The decision meant that funding was made available to support community events, activities and capital projects associated with commemorating the centenary of the First World War.

The board set aside $10 million for projects of national significance and $7 million for community projects and events. The first funding round opened in August 2012 and closed in November. A further funding round is now open and closes on 29 May 2013. Decisions from that round will be made in October.

All applicants to the fund must show they have a community purpose and can provide a benefit to New Zealand.

The First World War Centenary Panel was established by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage in July 2012 as an advisory group to help steer what will be an extensive programme to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War. There is more information about the programme on the website WW100.govt.nz.
