Environment Minister Amy Adams will host her federal and state counterparts in Wellington today and tomorrow for a meeting of the Council of Australian Government’s Standing Committee on Environment and Water (SCEW).

SCEW is held every year to discuss key environmental protection and water management issues.

This week’s meeting in Wellington is the first time the event has been held in New Zealand.

“As a member of this standing committee, the New Zealand Government is interested in a range of issues that face both countries including freshwater reform, waste policy and clean air,” Ms Adams says.

“These trans-Tasman meetings are an opportunity to share policies and ideas about future environmental policy and implementation.”

New Zealand and Australia already work together on a range of issues and standards. For example, a joint standard for collection, storage, transport and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment was recently completed.

SCEW will also provide Ms Adams with the opportunity to hold separate meetings with her Australian counterpart, Minister Tony Burke, as well as state and territory environment ministers.
