“Caribbean countries face great challenges as they seek to access international markets for their export industries.   The WTO must do more to assist them to access the benefits of the multilateral trading system,” Mr Groser says.

Speaking from Kingston, Jamaica during his visit to the Caribbean in support of his bid for the role of Director-General of the WTO, Mr Groser says “I know first-hand from New Zealand’s immediate neighbours in the Pacific, the unique needs of small sea-locked economies and the frustrations they face accessing the distant and protected developed world markets for their critical export industries. “The WTO must address these kinds of issues if it is to deliver for developing and least developed countries and enable small island economies to boost their growth and create jobs.”

“I am committed to ensuring that the WTO assists all of its members to access the benefits of their membership.  Developing countries have varied needs and interests.  The Pacific Island countries, in New Zealand’s neighbourhood, like the Caribbean Islands, face particular challenges.  They have specific needs within the WTO system.

“As Director General, I would look at concrete and practical ways that the WTO mechanisms can be better oriented to support the specific needs of these countries.  Among other things, I want to look carefully at how the organisation can work more closely with other international institutions to find practical ways to provide technical assistance and to build capacity for countries which are finding it difficult to implement their commitments or to engage with the organization in Geneva.

“Technical assistance and capacity building stand alongside and complement substantive negotiated outcomes reflecting the development agenda.  What these countries are telling me is that their needs are not complicated: internationally agreed trade rules, mechanisms to enforce them, and practical measures to help them benefit from their membership.  That must remain at the forefront of our minds as we move into a new phase in the WTO’s future.  It is not enough to talk about development; we need practical ideas to ensure less developed countries can leverage the benefits of the WTO trading system. 

“New Zealand was the first country in the world to give duty free quota free access to Least Developed Countries.  The negotiation currently underway between New Zealand and the Pacific Islands (PACER), is based on the fundamental concept that our smaller neighbours need improved access to our bigger market to develop – but they also need help to secure the benefits provided by that improved access.  I want to see that kind of thinking translated into the multilateral system,” Mr Groser says.

“The trade challenges faced by Caribbean WTO members, and by the ACP countries more broadly, are extremely close to those of New Zealand.  My discussions here in Kingston and elsewhere have confirmed that.  There is no doubt in my mind that Jamaica and its neighbours have much to gain from a successful WTO negotiating round.  The question they, and all developing countries need to ask themselves now is, who is best placed to deliver that for them?”
