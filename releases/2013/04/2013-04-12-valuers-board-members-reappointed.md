Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the reappointment of Evan Gamby and Hekiara Puketapu to the Valuers Registration Board.

An independent statutory body administered by Land Information New Zealand, the board regulates registered valuers and investigates complaints about them.

“Both Mr Gamby and Mr Puketapu are long-serving members of the board, having served for 22 and 10 years respectively. I have reappointed both for a further three years,” Mr Williamson says.

First appointed to the Valuers Registration Board in 1991, Evan Gamby has extensive property advisory, valuation, property management and arbitration experience. He currently chairs Auckland’s Telfer Young Group.

Hekiara Puketapu was first appointed in 2003. He has significant valuation experience, as well as strong negotiation and dispute resolution skills. He is currently Sector Manager Territorial Local Authorities with The Property Group.

“Mr Gamby and Mr Puketapu have made invaluable contributions to the work of the board and to the valuation profession overall.”
