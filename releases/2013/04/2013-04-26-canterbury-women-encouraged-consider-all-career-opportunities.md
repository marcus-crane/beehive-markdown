Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew is encouraging women in Canterbury to think laterally as they consider the career opportunities the region’s rebuild will provide.

“I believe that there will be many new career opportunities for women in Canterbury, in roles they might not have considered prior to the earthquakes,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew today met with a group of employers and other organisations engaged in the rebuild to discuss their views on employment options for the women of Canterbury.

“As Canterbury rebuilds, women have the opportunity to apply their existing skills in new ways,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“For instance, there is demand for workers in the construction industry right now – not just for builders and other tradespeople, but also for supervisors, project managers and administrators.”

The Ministry of Women’s Affairs also recently surveyed a number of firms involved in the construction and associated industries in Canterbury. They found that many of the firms would consider employing women for roles that have traditionally been filled by men.

“I also encourage Canterbury women who are thinking about training or retraining to consider the opportunities currently available to train in these types of ‘non-traditional’ roles,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The Government has prioritised assistance for those embarking on apprenticeships and there are many different types of apprenticeships that women can consider.

“The Canterbury Skills and Employment Hub was created to help get men and women into jobs to help Canterbury rebuild. I encourage interested women to contact the Hub to start investigating all the options available to them.”
