Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has hosted an event at Parliament to celebrate the rebranding of Children’s Health Camps.

“From today Children’s Health Camps will be known as Stand Children’s Services – Tu Maia Whanau,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The rebranding represents the start of an exciting new era for the iconic organisation, which has provided care and services for vulnerable children since 1919.”

“It also celebrates the fact that for many years the organisation has offered a much wider range of support than the previous name suggested.”

In addition to operating seven health camps across the country, Stand also have 76 social workers based in schools, including 17 as part of the SWiS initiative, and run Kidzacool school holiday camps, which provide much-needed respite for caregivers.

“The new identity also relates well to the call of the Children’s Action Plan, which asks every New Zealander to stand up for, and alongside, vulnerable children.”

Last year Stand undertook over 110,000 hours of social work and supported more than over 4,700 children and their families dealing with a range of issues.

“Children’s Health Camps have been a key partner for Child, Youth and Family in providing support, care, and interventions for at-risk families,” Mrs Bennett says.

“MSD provides over $16.5 million each year in support for the community social work, children’s villages and other services Stand provides.”

“The bold new identity we’ve welcomed today will no doubt carry on the significant work achieved so far.”
