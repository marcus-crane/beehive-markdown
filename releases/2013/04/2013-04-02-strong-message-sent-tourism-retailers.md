Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain has welcomed the successful prosecution of two companies and two individuals convicted of mislabelling products that were sold to visiting Asian tourists.

The sentencing in the Auckland District Court resulted from charges brought by the Commerce Commission under the Fair Trading Act followed a multi-agency investigation in August 2011.

“This is a landmark interagency investigation and its outcome sends a very clear message that the New Zealand Government will not tolerate the exploitation of our international visitors for financial gain,” says Mr Tremain.

“We strive to ensure that our visitors are offered the best possible experience of New Zealand, including their interactions with our retail sector.

“The Commerce Commission acts to protect the interest of consumers, and in this case, the rights of tourists who represent a valuable segment of our economy.”

The affected tourists from China, Korea and Taiwan were on organised tours that visited souvenir stores in Auckland and Rotorua. They were sold over-priced items like alpaca rugs, which were imported goods falsely labelled as New Zealand made, and duvets that did not have the claimed wool content.

“Breaches against tourists are relatively rare when considered across the wider tourism industry, but they will not be tolerated, says Mr Tremain.

“New Zealand makes many high-quality products that international visitors like purchasing when on holiday here. We will continue to ensure that goods offered to visitors are high-quality, good value for money and are correctly labelled.”
