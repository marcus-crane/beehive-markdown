The first solaria survey by the Ministry of Health has revealed there has been a notable decrease in the number of sunbed operators.

Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew says public health unit staff visited 144 sunbed operators between 1 July and 31 December 2012 to provide information on safe practice and monitor compliance with key aspects of the solaria standard.

“Many of the public health units noted a significant decrease in the number of places offering commercial sunbed services,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“In Auckland, for example, the number of sunbed operators has decreased from 73 to 39 since 2009 – a 46 per cent reduction.  And in the MidCentral area they have decreased from 41 operators to 26.

“One of the reported reasons for operators no longer offering sunbed services was the difficulties complying with the standard.

“Skin cancer is the most common cancer in New Zealand and it’s pleasing to hear some operators who are not meeting best practice have voluntarily chosen to stop providing commercial sunbed services.”

Health officials will be attending the Melanoma Summit in Wellington on 5 April to present the findings from the solaria survey.

The Summit is expected to attract over 200 participants, including GPs, nurses, pathologists, dermatologists, surgeons, oncologists, health promoters, researchers and policy makers.
