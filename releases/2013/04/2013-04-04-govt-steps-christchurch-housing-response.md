Forty new houses are to be constructed at the Rangers Park subdivision to provide additional temporary accommodation and help revitalise Christchurch’s eastern suburbs, Minister of Housing Dr Nick Smith announced today.

“This development of 40 new homes will be used to increase the supply of temporary accommodation for families as the rebuild gains momentum. It will enable people to maintain their work, school and community links in their local area while their repairs and rebuilds are being carried out.

“The new two, three and four bedroom homes will add to the 83 accommodation units managed by the Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service (CETAS) already established at Linwood Park, Kaiapoi Domain and Rāwhiti Domain. More than 300 Canterbury households have already been supported to date through this initiative.

“This development is different to the three existing temporary villages in that they will be new permanent homes that will be sold once demand for temporary accommodation has lessened. This is about the Government leading by example and investing in the revitalisation of the eastern suburbs. It will also bring to market, in time, housing in the affordable range for Christchurch families,” Dr Smith said.

“The new homes are to be built by Hawkins Construction starting this month, and are expected to be completed in November. The $12.5 million cost is being funded by the Government and will be offset by rent and any future house sales.

“This Rangers Park initiative is part of the Government’s broader programme of assistance to help with Christchurch’s housing challenges,” said Dr Smith.
