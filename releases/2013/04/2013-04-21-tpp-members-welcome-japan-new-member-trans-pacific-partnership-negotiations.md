Trade Minister Tim Groser is pleased to make the following statement on behalf of the eleven members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

“Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States of America and Viet Nam today welcomed Japan as a new participant in negotiations to conclude a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement.

“We believe that Japan’s participation in the negotiations will contribute to the objective of creating a 21st-Century agreement that will spur economic growth and development, promote innovation, benefit our consumers, and support the creation and retention of jobs, higher living standards and the reduction of poverty in our countries and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

“The existing TPP members particularly welcomed Japan’s commitment to achieving the shared goal of a comprehensive, high-ambition, next-generation agreement as rapidly as possible, consistent with the statements made by TPP Leaders and Trade Ministers on 12 November 2011 in Honolulu. We look forward to working with Japan as we seek to conclude a comprehensive and balanced package, taking into account the diversity of our levels of development.

“The existing TPP participants will now complete their domestic legal procedures, where applicable, after which Japan will formally join and participate in the negotiations.”
