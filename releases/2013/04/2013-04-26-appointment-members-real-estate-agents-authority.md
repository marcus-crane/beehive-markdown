Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the reappointment of five members of the Real Estate Agents Authority and the appointment of one new member.

Those reappointed to the Authority are:

- John Auld of New Plymouth
- Barrie Barnes of Auckland
- Denise Bovaird of Auckland
- Joan Harnett-Kindley of Wanaka
- David Russell of Wellington

The new appointee to the Authority is Aaron Bhatnagar of Auckland. 

Mr Bhatnagar runs his own management consultancy and is an experienced investment manager having managed an extensive property portfolio.  Mr Bhatnagar replaces Peter McDermott who will leave the Authority on 3 May 2013.

In announcing the appointment, Ms Collins acknowledged the work the Authority has done over the last three years in establishing itself as the regulatory body for the real estate industry.  She also acknowledged the contribution outgoing member Mr McDermott has made to that work.

The Authority was created by the Real Estate Agents Act 2008.  That Act significantly reformed the regulation of the real estate industry with a consumer protection focus which shifted regulatory responsibility away from the industry to independent bodies.
