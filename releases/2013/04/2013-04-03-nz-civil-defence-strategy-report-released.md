Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today welcomed the first progress report on the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Strategy.

“Overall, the report shows that good progress that has been made in the past five years in building New Zealand’s resilience and in the capability to manage civil defence emergencies,” Ms Kaye said.

“The report, which was delayed for two years as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, also looks ahead to future challenges and identifies improvements.

“As Civil Defence Minister one of my key priorities is to ensure we use what we have learned from Canterbury to strengthen our civil defence emergency management structure.

“The progress report shows that the Canterbury earthquakes have significantly heightened the focus on emergency preparedness and addressing earthquake risks, in particular, earthquake-prone buildings and infrastructure.

“But the experiences following the Canterbury earthquakes have shown that the recovery framework does not adequately provide for an emergency requiring large-scale recovery efforts. The Government is looking at reviewing legislation to find the best way to address this.

“This is a strategy for all New Zealanders. We still have more work to do to ensure New Zealanders take less of a ‘she’ll be right’ approach. It is everyone’s responsibility to understand and manage their risks at home, at work and in their community so that they are adequately prepared for emergencies.

“The report acknowledges the importance of improving arrangements for the recruitment and retention of volunteers.

“I will be discussing the progress report and how it fits with my Civil Defence priorities at four regional forums being held this month throughout New Zealand with the leadership of the 16 regional Civil Defence Emergency Groups. These start tomorrow in Palmerston North.”

The next progress report is due in 2016.
