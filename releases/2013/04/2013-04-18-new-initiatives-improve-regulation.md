Regulatory Reform Minister John Banks today announced that the Government has agreed to two new initiatives to improve New Zealand’s regulatory performance.

 The two initiatives are:

- More active regulatory stewardship
- Improved disclosure for legislation and regulation

 “Government agencies need to continue to improve their regulatory performance to ensure higher living standards for all New Zealanders,” Mr Banks says.    

 “More active regulatory stewardship is about monitoring regulations to make sure they remain fit for purpose.  It will raise expectations on how departments administer regulatory regimes, and how they develop legislation and regulation.” 

“Improved disclosure will increase transparency around the development of legislation and increase the scrutiny of how government legislation is prepared.   

“It will lift the expectations on government departments to follow high quality and transparent processes when preparing legislation.   This will help drive up the quality of new and changed regulations. 

“Departments will be required to disclose the quality assurance processes they have undertaken during the development of legislation, and key features of that legislation that are likely to be of interest to the public and Parliament. 

“Legislation to introduce the new disclosure regime will be introduced later this year,” Mr Banks says.    

These changes result from the National – ACT Confidence and Supply Agreement.   The Agreement included a commitment to achieve a mutually agreed outcome \[on a Regulatory Standards Bill] based on Treasury’s preferred option (option five).
