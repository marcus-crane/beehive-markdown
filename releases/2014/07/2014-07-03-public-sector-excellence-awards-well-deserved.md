State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman has congratulated the winners of the 2014 Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ) Gen-I Public Sector Excellence Awards.

“I would like to congratulate last night’s winners, and also those who were nominated. The IPANZ awards are a great way of recognising the innovations and excellent work that our public servants are delivering,” says Dr Coleman.

“These agencies are focused on outcomes, not outputs, and are making a real difference in our communities. It is clear that agencies are continuing to work more effectively to deliver better value and better results for New Zealanders.”

A total of 77 nominations were received by IPANZ. The 2014 winners are:

- Police Model: Prevention First - NZ Police (winner of the Prime Minister’s award);
- Ngāti Haua Settlement of Non-Raupatu Historical Claims - Ministry of Justice;
- Infrastructure as a Service - Department of Internal Affairs;
- Hutt Valley Justice Sector Innovation Project – Ministry of Justice, NZ Police, Department of Corrections;
- Transition: A Cross-Agency Leadership Development Programme – NZ Police, Ministry of Social Development, NZDF, Inland Revenue;
- Management Development Programme for Middle Managers - Western Bay of Plenty District Council;
- Safer Summer: Speed Enforcement Campaign – NZ Police;
- Alternative Environmental Justice – Environment Canterbury;
- Leading by Backing Others to Win – Ministry of Education.

The IPANZ awards promote excellence in vision, innovation, and achievement of results. They are also a useful way to highlight good examples of best practice which other agencies can learn from.

The awards were held on 2 July 2014 at the TSB Arena, Wellington. More information can be found at: [www.ipanz.org.nz/excellenceawards](http://www.ipanz.org.nz/excellenceawards).
