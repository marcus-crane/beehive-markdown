Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will visit Korea, Croatia, Montenegro and Georgia this week.

In Seoul, Minister McCully will meet with his Korean counterpart, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-Se, to help advance the Korea-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement negotiations.

“The negotiations are at a critical juncture.  My visit to Seoul will allow me to highlight the New Zealand Government’s view that a Free Trade Agreement is an essential part of our relationship with Korea,” Mr McCully says.

“Following my visit to Seoul, I will travel to Dubrovnik to attend the Croatia Forum. This will provide an opportunity to get a regional perspective on issues in the Balkans region, and further New Zealand’s bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.

“The Croatia Forum is attended by Ministers from around the region, leaders from European Union institutions, and representatives from organisations such as the World Bank and NATO.”

Mr McCully will also travel to Montenegro, to meet Foreign Minister Igor Lukšić, and to Georgia, to meet Foreign Minister Maia Panjikidze.

“My visits to Montenegro and Georgia will be the first by a New Zealand Foreign Minister. These visits will help to strengthen New Zealand’s growing friendships in this part of the world, and demonstrate our commitment to engaging with small states,” Mr McCully says.
