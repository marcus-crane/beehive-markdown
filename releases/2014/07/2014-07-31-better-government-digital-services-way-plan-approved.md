All government agencies now have a shared plan to deliver more and better digital public services. Eight agencies have been working together to implement Better Public Services Result 10 - making it easier for people to do business with government in the digital environment.  Cabinet has now expanded that work to cover the whole State services and endorsed a Blueprint for the work as government policy.

“We want to put in place a system where New Zealanders can complete transactions with government easily in a digital environment. Result 10 is one of the Government’s 10 Better Public Services target results which aims to improve customers’ interaction with government,” said Internal Affairs Minister Hon Peter Dunne, who is specifically responsible for Result 10, says a common approach will benefit all New Zealanders.

“The Result 10 Blueprint is a strategy and a practical guide for digital service delivery to New Zealanders. It has been designed with the customer at the centre, around people’s life events such as going overseas, getting married or getting an education.

“Customers will be able to do more digitally, more easily as more and more government agencies use the Blueprint, to offer more consistent, integrated digital services centred on the customer, based on their needs,” says Mr Dunne.

The *Government ICT Strategy and Action Plan to 2017*, Ied by the Government Chief Information Officer Colin MacDonald, will help agencies transform their ICT systems to deliver these services.

“The implementation of better digital public services across the State sector would mean reduced customer effort required to access government services. A shared approach to digital service delivery will also save time and money for as infrastructure and transaction costs fall.

“Delivering better public services within tight financial constraints is one of the Government's four priorities for this term. And achieving results that make a difference to New Zealanders is at the heart of that”, says Mr Dunne.
