Justice Minister Judith Collins will travel to Melbourne today to attend the inaugural meeting of the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council (LCCSC) with Australian ministers tomorrow.

The LCCSC replaces the previous Standing Council on Law and Justice and the Standing Council on Police and Emergency Management. The Council is made up of ministers responsible for law, justice, police and emergency management and includes representatives from New Zealand, Australia and each of its states and territories.

“I’m looking forward to discussing with my Australian counterparts ways our nations can continue to collaborate on law and justice issues of mutual interest,” Ms Collins says.

“There are many areas in which both New Zealand and Australia benefit from increased cooperation such as work to combat organised crime.”

Separate to the Council meeting, Ms Collins will also have bilateral talks with Australian Minister of Justice, Hon Michael Keenan and Minister of Immigration and Border Protection, Hon Scott Morrison.

“I will be discussing progress on work to improve trans-Tasman criminal history sharing with Minister Keenan,” says Ms Collins.

“With a high level of migration between our two countries, improved and timely criminal information will help us to better protect New Zealanders.”
