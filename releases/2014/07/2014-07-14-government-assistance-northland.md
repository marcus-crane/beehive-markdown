The Government is considering a range of options to further support those affected by the Northland storms, Civil Defence Minister Kaye says.

“I can confirm that the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) has liaised with the Far North District Council, Kaipara District Council, Whangarei District Council and Northland Regional Council to establish a mayoral relief fund,” Ms Kaye says.

“This will be set up by the Far North and Whangarei councils with the majority of the fund going to the most affected areas in Northland.

“I am pleased to confirm that the Government will be contributing $100,000 in the short term, with further assistance considered if needed.”

MCDEM will continue working with representatives from the councils to ensure that assistance is available for those who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the severe weather event, Ms Kaye says.  Other measures being considered include counselling and support services.

Though better weather since Sunday and dropping water levels in rivers across the region have enabled the region to begin to recover, damage in Northland has been widespread.

“Floodwaters have affected many homes and families,” Ms Kaye says.  “Some communities have been isolated and without power for a number of days. The roading network has suffered damage from slips and flooding.

“I will be travelling to the Far North and visiting Kaitaia and affected areas tomorrow with local MP Mike Sabin. There is currently welfare provision available for families that have been affected, however the mayoral relief fund will enable other assistance for families who may need support at this time.”

Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy will be travelling to the Hikurangi area tomorrow, where farms and orchards have been severely affected by flooding.

“While attention is now turning to measures that will help the community recover, I would like to thank the emergency services, council staff, staff of the utility companies, and the many volunteers who have worked together to support the Northland communities,” Ms Kaye says.

Those requiring assistance should contact the Far North District Council on 0800 920 029 or the Whangarei District Council on 0800 932 463.
