Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat Jeremy Clarke-Watson as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Abu Dhabi.

“The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is New Zealand's most diversified market in the Middle East with two-way trade worth $1.65 billion in 2013,” says Mr McCully.

“A large number of New Zealand companies use the UAE as a springboard to the wider Gulf region.

“The UAE is also a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which is a focus for our free trade negotiations.

“Politically, the relationship is in excellent shape, with regular two-way visits between the two countries.  

“Our engagement with the UAE is continuing to develop across a range of areas including renewable energy, environment, defence and commercial partnerships,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Clarke-Watson is currently the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (MFAT) Auckland office. In that role he has built strong relationships with New Zealand exporters. He has previously been posted to Saudi Arabia and Viet Nam.
