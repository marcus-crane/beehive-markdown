Peter Biggs and Bronwen Holdsworth have been appointed to the board of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and members Donald Best, Lisa Bates and Roger Taylor have been reappointed, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“I am pleased that Peter Biggs and Bronwen Holdsworth are joining the NZSO board, and that the three members will continue their stewardship,” Mr Finlayson said. “Their contribution at board level will ensure that our world class national orchestra remains in very good hands.”

Peter Biggs is chief executive of Clemenger BBDO in Melbourne and is the former managing director of Clemenger BBDO in Wellington. A strong advocate of the arts, he was chair of the Arts Council of New Zealand (Creative New Zealand) from 1999 to 2006, and is a member of numerous private and public sector boards in New Zealand and Australia. He chaired the Government’s recent orchestral sector review and was made CNZM in the Queen's Birthday Honours last year.

Bronwen Holdsworth is chairman of Pultron Composites Ltd. A keen musician and accomplished pianist, she has been involved with a large number of music, visual art, education and business organisations. She is a strong supporter of the Gisborne International Music Competition.

Donald Best is the current chair, and has a broad range of commercial governance experience. He has an excellent understanding of the arts sector, and has previously chaired the New Zealand String Quartet Trust and the Wellington Regional Orchestra (Orchestra Wellington). He has held a variety of commercial positions including partner, company secretary, director, and managing director in a range of chartered accounting, property, and asset management firms.

Lisa Bates supports the not-for-profit sector and has contributed to fundraising strategies for many major arts organisations. An experienced independent director including for Regional Facilities Auckland, she is also co-founder of design and brand agency Hawkins&Co.

Roger Taylor is a current member, and chairs the audit committee of the Board. He has considerable governance experience and has served on numerous commercial and Crown boards.

The objective of the NZSO, a Crown entity, is to enrich the musical life of New Zealanders by presenting artistically excellent concerts, performed throughout the country and abroad by a full time professional orchestra of international standing.

Mr Finlayson thanked outgoing members Marie Brown and Colleen Marshall for their contribution during two terms on the NZSO Board.
