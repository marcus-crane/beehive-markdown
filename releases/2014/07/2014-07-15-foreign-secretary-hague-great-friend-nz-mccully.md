Foreign Minister Murray McCully today paid tribute to outgoing UK Foreign Secretary, William Hague, describing him as a “great friend to New Zealand.”

“As Foreign Secretary, William Hague has served his country with great distinction,” Mr McCully says.

“Widely respected internationally, Mr Hague has provided leadership on a range of global issues and played a major role in furthering what is one of New Zealand’s oldest and closest relationships.

“During his time as Foreign Secretary he visited New Zealand twice – underlining his personal commitment to deepening the ties between the UK and New Zealand. He has also been a great champion of the value of the Commonwealth.

“On a personal level, I have enjoyed an outstanding working relationship with Mr Hague and have greatly admired his command of complex foreign policy issues such as the Arab Spring, the civil war in Syria and the situation in Gaza.

“I wish him well in his new role and I look forward to working with his successor when they are appointed,” Mr McCully says.
