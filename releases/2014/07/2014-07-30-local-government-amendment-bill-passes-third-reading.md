The Local Government Act Amendment Bill (No 3) passed its third and final reading in parliament tonight. It paves the way for improved housing affordability and more effective local government says Associate Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-liga.

“The bill includes improvements to the development contributions regime, making them fairer and more transparent. This will help keep the costs of building new homes down.”

“This is just one of the ways the government is looking to improve housing affordability.  This is being done alongside increasing land supply and establishing Special Housing Areas (SHA’s), removing tariffs on building materials and reform of the Resource Management Act, Mr Lotu-Iiga says

“The Local Government Amendment Bill continues our sensible local government reform and acts on recommendations made in the final report of the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into Housing affordability in 2012. This bill minimises costs and ensures funds collected for infrastructure in a particular area are spent as intended.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga says under the bill local authorities will need to carefully manage community infrastructure. It also draws on the principles of shared services and councils working together to reduce costs of services; flexible governance models; changes in consultation processes and greater transparency for council planning and management of local infrastructure.

“The introduction of a mandatory 30 year infrastructure strategy will enhance the strategic management of those assets.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Bill also delivers better, more streamlined community consultation provisions.

“Councils will have the flexibility to consult with stakeholders in ways which are appropriate to matters in hand, rather than a one size fits all approach. This will enable a better balance between cost effective decision making and constructive community consultation on the things that are important to the ratepayers of New Zealand.”
