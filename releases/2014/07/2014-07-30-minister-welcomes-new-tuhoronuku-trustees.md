Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson has welcomed the announcement today of the 22 trustees of the Tūhoronuku Independent Mandated Authority (TIMA), which will negotiate the settlement of Ngapuhi’s historical Treaty claims with the Crown.

“I would like to welcome the new faces who have joined TIMA as a result of the election and wish them well with the challenges ahead,“ Mr Finlayson said.

The trustees comprise 15 hapū representatives, spread evenly between the five regions of Ngapuhi’s rohe; four urban representatives; a kuia representative; a kaumātua representative, and one member appointed by Te Rūnanga o Ngapuhi.

TIMA held fresh elections to ensure the newly independent body represented widely the views of Ngāpuhi members in Treaty settlement negotiations with the Crown.

“Holding fresh elections was about giving all members of Ngāpuhi the option to have another say about who would represent them in negotiations with the Crown, especially given changes made during the mandating process to increase hapū representation,” Mr Finlayson said.

“I would like to welcome the addition of new hapū kaikorero and other representatives to Tūhoronuku and the new ideas and fresh perspectives they will bring to the negotiations.”

The Tūhoronuku trustees will meet to elect a chair and deputy chair. They will then start to work towards signing terms of negotiations with the Crown. 

“I would also like to thank departing members for their work over the last few years and the contribution they have made,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Ngāpuhi, the country’s largest iwi, have many well-founded historical grievances,” Mr Finlayson said “The Crown looks forward to engaging with Ngāpuhi to negotiate commercial and financial redress, as well as cultural redress including the ability to play a role in the management of land of high cultural importance to Ngāpuhi.”
