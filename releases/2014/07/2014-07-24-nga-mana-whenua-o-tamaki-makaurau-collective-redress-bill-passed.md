The House sat under extended hours today for the third and final reading of the Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau Collective Redress Bill, which recognises the historical claims of 13 iwi and hapū over their shared interests in the Auckland area, including 14 of the region’s maunga (volcanic cones), and motu (islands).

The third reading was attended by iwi leaders, Auckland Mayor Len Brown, and representatives from Auckland Council.

“The passage of the Bill marks an important milestone for the iwi and hapū of Tāmaki Makurau, Auckland and the Crown,” Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson said.

The Bill gives effect to the deed, signed by Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau (the Tāmaki Collective) and the Crown on 8 September 2012, for collective redress for 13 iwi and hapū.

The Bill will vest the Crown-owned portions of 14 maunga, including Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill, Maungawhau/Mt Eden, Mt Albert and North Head Historic Reserve. 

With the exception of North Head and Mount Smart, governance of the maunga will be taken over by a newly established board, the Tūpuna Maunga o Tāmaki Makaurau Authority, made up of representatives from the Tāmaki Collective and Auckland Council.  Auckland Council will continue to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the cones.

Four Hauraki Gulf motu (Rangitoto Island, Motutapu Island, Motuihe Island/Te Motu-a-Ihenga and Tiritiri Matangi Island) will be vested in the Tāmaki Collective, which will then after one month vest the motu back in the Crown as a gift to the people of New Zealand.

There will be no change to public access to the maunga or motu during or after this period.

“I am pleased the iwi and hapū of the Tāmaki Collective have come together and reached this agreement. This is an important day to help conclude the settlement of historic Treaty of Waitangi claims across Auckland.”

The Bill forms part of the individual Treaty settlements for iwi and hapū within the Tāmaki Collective, which have either been concluded or are under negotiation. The Collective Settlement recognises the complex and overlapping nature of claims in the Tāmaki Makaurau region.

The Tāmaki Collective is made up of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, Ngāti Maru, Ngāti Pāoa, Ngāti Tamaoho, Ngāti Tamaterā, Ngāti Te Ata, Ngaati Whanaunga, Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, Te Ākitai Waiohua, Te Kawerau ā Maki, Te Patukirikiri and Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua.
