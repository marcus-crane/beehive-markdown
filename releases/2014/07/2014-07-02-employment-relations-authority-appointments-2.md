Labour Minister Simon Bridges today announced the reappointment of Rosemary Monaghan as Chief of the Employment Relations Authority. 

“Rosemary Monaghan was first appointed to the position of Chief of the Employment Relations Authority in September 2013.  She will continue to lead the Authority as Chief for a further year,” Mr Bridges says. 

Mr Bridges also announced the reappointment of three current members, David Appleton, Michael Loftus and Michele Ryan.  Vicki Campbell, previously a member of the Authority, has also been appointed as a member. All have been appointed for one year terms.

“The ERA performs a very important role in New Zealand’s employment relations system. It investigates and works to resolve employment relationship problems, and the members appointed today have considerable experience in this area,” Mr Bridges says.
