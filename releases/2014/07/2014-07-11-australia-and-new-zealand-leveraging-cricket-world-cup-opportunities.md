Streamlined visa arrangements will assist Australia and New Zealand to capitalise on the tourism opportunities that will flow from co-hosting the 11th ICC Cricket World Cup in 2015, ministers have said.

The Australian and New Zealand Governments have agreed to allow international visitors attending the World Cup the convenience of applying for only one visa in order to be granted entry into both countries.

New Zealand’s Associate Tourism Minister Todd McClay participated in a meeting today of Australia’s tourism ministers in Melbourne, hosted by Federal Tourism Minister Andrew Robb. They discussed how both countries can work together to maximise the tourism opportunities stemming from the tournament. 

Mr Robb said the streamlined visa arrangements would make it easier for visitors to attend World Cup matches on both sides of the Tasman.

“It provides the flexibility for tourists to freely move between Australia and New Zealand for the World Cup. This is a major international sporting event which will bring major benefits for our tourism and hospitality sectors,” Mr Robb says. 

Fourteen cities across Australia and New Zealand will host 49 ICC Cricket World Cup matches over February and March of 2015 and all of these cities will benefit from a major influx of international visitors. The first semi-final will be played at Auckland’s Eden Park while the final will be played at Melbourne’s MCG on 29 March.

Mr McClay said both countries will share in the benefits of being host nations.

“Next year, seven New Zealand cities will host ICC World Cup games, and we welcome the opportunity to again showcase our wonderful country to the world and work with Australia to capitalise on the tourism and other economic benefits of staging this event.”

“The integrated visa process will make it easier for fans to follow their teams and catch all the action as well experience the many tourist offerings in both countries.”

“Australia and New Zealand look forward to welcoming the international cricketing community next year and showcasing our countries to the world,” Mr McClay says.
