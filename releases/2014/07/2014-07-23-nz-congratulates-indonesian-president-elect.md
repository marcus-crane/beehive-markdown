Foreign Minister Murray McCully today congratulated Joko Widodo on winning the Indonesian Presidential election.

The Indonesian Electoral Commission announced overnight that former Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo and his running mate Yusuf Kalla won the Presidential race, with a reported margin of roughly 8 million votes over former General Prabowo Subianto.

“The election has once again demonstrated the Indonesian people’s commitment to democracy, and I look forward to working constructively with President-elect Joko Widodo,” Mr McCully says.

“Indonesia is one of the world’s largest democracies, with some 190 million registered voters, including around 30 percent voting for the first time in these elections.  The voter turnout of more than 70 percent is impressive.”

“Indonesia is an important partner for New Zealand both bilaterally and within the region,” Mr McCully says.
