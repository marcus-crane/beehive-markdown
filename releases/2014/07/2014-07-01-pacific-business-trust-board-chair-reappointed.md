Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has today announced the reappointment of Mrs Poalaga Selma Scott as Chairperson of the Board of the Pacific Business Trust.

Mrs Scott is a barrister and solicitor in her own law practice and has been a member of the board since April 2007. She was the interim Chairperson from July 2013.

“Selma’s legal background and long term membership of the board offer the benefit of continuity and stability to the board and its work with Pacific businesses,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Pacific Business Trust is a charitable trust, established in 1985 and incorporated under the Charitable Trust Act 1957. The function of the Trust is to develop a strong economic base for Pacific peoples in New Zealand by providing opportunities through business ownership and participation.

Mrs Scott is based in Christchurch and was previously a member of the Ministers’ Advisory Council, Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs; the Human Rights Review Tribunal; the State Housing Appeal Authority; and a member of the Community Law Centre – Canterbury.

She is appointed as Chairperson for a term of one year.
