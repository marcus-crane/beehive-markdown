Indian students with a passion for sporting excellence are being encouraged to apply for new scholarships to study top level programmes at New Zealand tertiary institutions. 

“With New Zealand co-hosting the Cricket World Cup next year, this scholarship will help raise awareness of New Zealand education generally and our expertise in sport,” Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce says.

“India has one of the world’s largest economies and total trade with New Zealand currently exceeds $1 billion per year. The Government is focused on developing our relationship with India further so that it becomes a core trade, economic and political partner for New Zealand.

“Education is a key part of this activity, with Indian students making up the second largest and fastest growing source of international students to New Zealand.”

Mr Joyce says the scholarship programme is one of several activities underway to deepen New Zealand’s education relationship with India following a steady flow of Ministerial visits over the last few years.

“Many of these initiatives have a focus on increasing the quality and level of qualifications studied by Indian students here,” Mr Joyce says

The New Zealand India Sports Scholarships are open to Indian citizens enrolling to study bachelor or postgraduate qualifications in New Zealand beginning in 2015.

Successful recipients will have their tuition fees funded for the first year of full-time study and also receive some support for living costs.

The New Zealand India Sports Scholarships are a partnership between Education New Zealand and the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
