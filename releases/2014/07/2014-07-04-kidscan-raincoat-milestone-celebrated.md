Prime Minister John Key and Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today joined Lincoln Heights School to celebrate the handing over of the 100,000th KidsCan raincoat to a school child.

Operating since 2005, the children’s charity KidsCan is supporting more than 400 low decile schools by providing much needed items to vulnerable children including food, raincoats, waterproof trousers, shoes, socks and hygiene products.

“Today is about recognising the huge contribution KidsCan is making to low income families throughout the country ensuring children have the basic necessities so they can concentrate on learning,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Massey University research confirms how valuable the KidsCan programme is.  Raincoats are making a difference in reducing absenteeism.  Children are being kept warm and dry meaning there’s less sickness and better attendance during winter.

“The government is committed to supporting vulnerable families in its partnership with the community and business. 

“We’re providing $1.5 million over three years to KidsCan for basic necessities.  Earlier this year I announced nearly $1 million for the KidsCan Nitbusters programme.  In last year’s budget, the government invested $9.5 million for the KickStart Breakfast in Schools expansion, which is matched in value by Fonterra and Sanitarium. 

“We know parents in paid work offer the best route out of poverty for families.  In the past two years we’ve seen a drop of nearly 30,000 children living in benefit dependent households.

“Whatever people think about parental responsibility, providing food and other support in schools for low income families is all about the children.  We want children to have the best start in life and a good education is a cornerstone for a successful future,” says Mrs Bennett.
