Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey will visit New Zealand between 21 and 23 July – his first visit to this country since becoming Treasurer last year, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“I’m looking forward to hosting Mr Hockey for our annual bilateral meeting,” Mr English says. “We’ve enjoyed a strong and positive personal relationship going back a number of years and I’m looking forward to catching up with him once again.

“New Zealand’s economic, trade and investment ties with Australia are closer than with any other country. We share a number of common opportunities and challenges, which I’m keen to discuss with Mr Hockey.

“The visit will follow New Zealand’s attendance at the Leadership Group of the Business 20 in Sydney this week - a forum that brought together business leaders from across the G20.

“The New Zealand Government appreciates Australia – through its G20 presidency – providing the opportunity for New Zealand to attend a number of G20-related meetings this year,” Mr English says.

During his New Zealand visit, Mr Hockey will visit Christchurch to learn about progress with the city’s rebuild.

In Wellington, he will meet Prime Minister John Key and other ministers, along with a number of business leaders.

Mr Hockey and Mr English will address a Trans-Tasman Business Circle lunch in Wellington on 23 July, before Mr Hockey returns to Australia.
