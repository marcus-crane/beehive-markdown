Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner says the latest Use and Trust in Official Statistics Survey shows an increasing number of New Zealanders are taking part in surveys and accessing government statistics online.

“Participating and sharing information with Statistics New Zealand benefits everyone.  We need to access reliable data for social and economic planning.”

The Use and Trust survey, commissioned by Statistics New Zealand, monitors the awareness, use of, and trust in official statistics.  It’s run on a three-yearly rotation across different user groups: public, government workers and business.

“Results show one in four New Zealanders are now using government statistics, and among Māori it has risen to close to one in three.” Ms Wagner says.

“More people are accessing Statistics New Zealand’s website for information.  A key focus of this Government is to make it easy to interact with the government online, and this survey confirms we’re achieving that goal.

“Survey results also indicate Statistics New Zealand continues to been seen as a trusted and confidential source of information.  This level of credibility gives people the confidence to respond to surveys and use its data.”
