Applications for the 2015 Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund are now open, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“The 6th of February next year marks the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty at the Waitangi grounds,” Mr Finlayson “and this Fund will again allow the opportunity to commemorate the occasion in a variety of ways.”

As well as administering the Fund, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage is coordinating the Government’s wider approach to commemorating the 175th anniversary.

To acknowledge the anniversary, the criteria of the Fund have been extended to include events that may fall on the date the Treaty was signed in other areas in New Zealand.

Applications to the fund can be made for events that are themed on the commemoration of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, and that:

- promote nation and community building;
- encourage wide community participation;
- promote a cultural experience;
- take place on or near Waitangi Day (6th of February), or on a date related to when the Treaty was signed in other areas.

Applications close at 5pm on Friday 19 September 2014.
