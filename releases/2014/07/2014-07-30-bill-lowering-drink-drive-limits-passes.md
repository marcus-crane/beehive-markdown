Legislation that will lower the adult drink-driving limits from 1 December 2014 has passed its third and final reading in Parliament today says Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee.

“Changes delivered by this legislation will save lives and reduce injuries, and they demonstrate the government’s commitment to improving road safety,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Land Transport Amendment Bill 2013 will lower the adult breath alcohol limit from 400mcg of alcohol per litre of breath, to 250mcg.  The blood alcohol limit will reduce from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, to 50mg.

The legislation creates a new offence for drivers with a breath alcohol level between 251-400mcg, resulting in penalties of an infringement fee of $200 and 50 demerit points.  For those drivers who refuse or fail to undergo to an evidential breath test, the infringement fee will rise to $700 as well as 50 demerit points.

Drivers who accumulate 100 or more demerit points from driving offences within two years receive a three month driver’s licence suspension.

“Lowering the adult drink-driving limit sends a clear signal that consuming alcohol at high levels and then driving is unacceptable,” Mr Brownlee says.
