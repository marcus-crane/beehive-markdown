The Ministry of Education aims to repair a further 15 quake-damaged school pools in the greater Christchurch area with most due for completion in time for the 2015 school year, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye said today.

“The pools repair programme is being funded as part of the government’s $1.137 billion investment over 10 years in education renewal in greater Christchurch,” Ms Kaye says.

“Around $50m of this was set aside for urgent repairs, including of swimming pools and last year, we finished repairing the first group of 23 school pools in the region.

“Water safety is important and is part of the New Zealand school curriculum. The damage to pools in the region has created unique challenges for schools and parents, and we want to make sure young Cantabrians have access to school pools. 

“These repairs will ensure more children can build their confidence in and around water, and get involved in water safety activities.”

Following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes in Canterbury, a significant number of school swimming pools were closed, along with community pools such as Christchurch City Council’s QEII Aquatic Centre and Centennial Pool facilities.

The government is investing $1.1m in the second tranche of pool repairs, bringing the total invested so far in the programme to $2m, Ms Kaye says.

The Ministry of Education has been working closely with the Christchurch City and Waimakariri District councils to identify school swimming pools that will allow public access.

The Ministry is also carrying out a feasibility study to assist with a long-term strategy for Christchurch school swimming pools, and this will determine any future work required.

“Repairing school swimming pools is another step in restoring key infrastructure in the region and supporting the government’s commitment to greater Christchurch,” Ms Kaye says.
