A Bill to improve support provided to veterans has unanimously passed its third reading in Parliament, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse says.

“The Veterans’ Support Bill will enable the Government to better meet the needs of both older veterans and those of modern-day deployments,’’ Mr Woodhouse says.

The Bill is central to the $60 million package announced by the Government in response to the 2010 Law Commission review of the War Pensions Act 1954.

The 1954 Act was found by the Law Commission to be outdated, unwieldy and no longer suitable for the needs of veterans.

“Next week marks the 100th anniversary of the start of New Zealand’s involvement in the First World War. It is fitting that this third reading was before the House today, enabling us to improve the services provided to our current and future veterans.

“I have confidence that the new legislation will mean thousands of veterans benefit from increased care, support, and recognition.

“Many people have been involved in the development of this new legislation and I would particularly like to thank the hard-working and dedicated staff of Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand. I must also extend my thanks to United Future and the Maori Party for their advocacy and contribution to the Bill.’’
