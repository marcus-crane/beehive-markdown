Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee joined fellow dignitaries today in turning the first sod to mark the official start of construction on the State highway 3 Vickers to City improvements. The project will free up the main highway in and out of New Plymouth, providing relief from traffic congestion and a boost to the productivity of one of New Zealand’s fastest-growing regions.

“We recognise that Taranaki is helping to lead the way as our nation’s economy continues to grow, and we’ll make even swifter headway when this major bottleneck is removed.

“Improving traffic flow across the Waiwhakaiho River and beyond will unlock genuine economic potential by making it more efficient to move people and goods in and out of the city.

“The upgraded highway will provide welcome relief for New Plymouth motorists, while also giving cyclists safer, more user-friendly facilities that separate them from traffic,” Mr Brownlee says.

Taranaki has boasted some of the most encouraging economic growth in the country, with one of the fastest expanding regional economies since 2007 and the highest per capita GDP. The Government is committed to knocking down further barriers to productivity.

“Taranaki is on a roll, and we’re committed to supporting it with the infrastructure it needs. We’re confident that our investment in a more efficient transport system will help Taranaki to continue to progress in leaps and bounds.

”As well as the Vickers to City project, the Government has committed to progress the Normanby Overbridge in South Taranaki, and to work towards improvements to the challenging corridor to the north that passes through Mt Messenger and the Awakino Gorge.

“Together with Vickers to City, these projects will help Taranaki become more prosperous, while also making our highway network more resilient and safe”, Mr Brownlee says.
