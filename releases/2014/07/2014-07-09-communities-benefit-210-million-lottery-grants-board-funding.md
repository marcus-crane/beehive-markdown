Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board Hon Peter Dunne announced today over $210 million generated from Lottery profits will be available to support a wide range of local and national projects this year.

“It is particularly exciting to see $15 million of funding allocated to the Significant Projects Fund (SPF). The SPF was re-launched in 2013 to assist large scale community projects of regional or national significance to progress.

“In the past year the SPF has funded a number of major projects, including the restoration of the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch; the Waitangi National Trust Board’s Museum of Waitangi; and the Southland District Council’s ‘Around the Mountains Cycle Trail’.  Each of these will deliver real benefits to New Zealand communities and make a significant impact on people’s lives; the Board and I are looking forward to seeing what projects are allocated funding in the next round”, says Mr Dunne.

The Board has also acknowledged the significance of the approaching centenary of World War One with $5 million of funding being allocated to enable more communities to recognise the impact of the war locally, nationally and internationally.

“The recent funding round for World War One Commemorations saw 80 projects receiving funding.  It was great to see the wide range of projects, from the nationally significant, such as the Auckland War Memorial Museum’s Cenotaph Home and Community project to local initiatives such as the Tokoroa District Memorial Returned Services Association’s Field of Remembrance.    

“The Board will continue to support arts, culture and sporting initiatives through funding of over $97 million to the three statutory bodies supported by the Board: the New Zealand Film Commission (including the New Zealand Film Archive), Creative New Zealand and Sport New Zealand” says Mr Dunne.
