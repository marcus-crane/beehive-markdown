A just published report estimates the census will deliver about $1billion in benefits during the next 25 years, Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner says.

The report, *Valuing the Census,* was commissioned by Statistics New Zealand and written by economic analysis firm TDB Advisory.

“The analysis shows every dollar invested in the census generates a net benefit of $5 in the economy, which is a great return on investment.

“Data from the five yearly census of population and dwellings is vital to inform decision making at a central government, local government, community and business level,” Ms Wagner says.

The government has committed $119 million for the next census in 2018, which will have will have a target of 70 per cent of forms completed online, a reduced workforce, and make more use of administrative data.
