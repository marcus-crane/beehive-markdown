Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the establishment of an ICT Advisory Service to help schools make the most of their new connections to the Managed Network.

In the interim, a targeted service will be delivered by Network For Learning (N4L). This will enable a tender process for the provision of a more comprehensive Learning Technologies Advisory Service to be completed.

The Government is investing $211 million in the N4L programme, which will provide fast and reliable internet connections with security services to help schools create a safe online environment for their students.

“The ICT Advisory Service will provide technical support to schools that have connected to the Managed Network to help them realise the full benefits of the network,” Ms Kaye says.

The Learning Technologies Advisory Service, to be launched in February 2015, will provide schools with strategic advice on how technologies can help them achieve their educational goals.

“The rollout of fast internet to schools reached a milestone ahead of schedule last month, with more than 500 schools now connected to the Managed Network,” Ms Kaye says.

“More than 900 schools are expected to be connected by the end of this year, and N4L is on track to connect all participating schools by the end of 2016.

“The Government is committed to supporting schools to use technology effectively and ensuring young New Zealanders are well equipped to succeed in today’s global economy and society.

“This initiative will ensure that every student will be able to benefit from technology to achieve their best, no matter where they are in New Zealand.”

The Ministry of Education-funded ICT Advisory Service will be available from July 7.
