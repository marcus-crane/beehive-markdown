Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner says a computer system developed 25 years ago to help Pacific nations gather reliable trade information is now used in more than a dozen countries.

The PC Trade system was developed by Statistics New Zealand to support Pacific countries with limited staff or resources.  It has been upgraded several times and is now used in the likes of Tonga, Cook Islands, Kiribati and Niue.

“PC Trade is a long standing success story because it provides a recognised tool and support for the delivery of valuable trade statistics.

“Robust and independent statistics are incredibly important, as they help governments and people make informed decisions,” Ms Wagner says.

Funding for PC Trade is provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through NZ Aid.  Statistics New Zealand provides technical expertise and ongoing support to those countries using it.
