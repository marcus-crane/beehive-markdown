Land Information Minister Michael Woodhouse today released the *2014 Report on Agency Adoption of the Declaration on Open and Transparent Government*.

The Declaration requires public sector agencies to release their high value public data for reuse by third parties.

“The Report shows that government agencies are increasingly releasing public non-personal data in open formats for reuse,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“In turn, third parties are using that public data in increasingly innovative ways – creating a raft of new products, tools and services for use by industry and the wider public.’’

Among those products is [www.watchmystreet.co.nz](http://www.watchmystreet.co.nz) – developed by a private company using public data from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), the Ministry of Education and Wellington City Council – which allows the public to monitor property values in Wellington.

Other examples include Napier City Council’s ‘GIS Napier’, a free online map viewer that uses data from the LINZ Data Service (LDS), and software firm Omega Tech’s work on a message system to alert users to changes on the road network based on their commonly travelled routes.
