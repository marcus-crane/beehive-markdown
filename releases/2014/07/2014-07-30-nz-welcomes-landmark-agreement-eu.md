Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the conclusion of negotiations on the Partnership Agreement on Relations and Cooperation (PARC) between New Zealand and the European Union.

Minister McCully and the High Representative of the European Union, Baroness Catherine Ashton issued a Joint Statement on the Agreement following their meeting at the Pacific Islands Forum in Palau.

“The PARC provides a formal framework for cooperation between New Zealand and the European Union, placing our overall relationship with the European Union on an even stronger footing,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand and the European Union have a wide ranging relationship which covers cooperation on foreign policy, development, trade and economic interests, science and innovation, and security matters.

“The European Union is one New Zealand’s most important development partners in the Pacific region where we are working together closely on renewable energy projects following the Pacific Energy Summit in 2013

“The Agreement will also provide a platform for pursuing New Zealand’s ambitions for a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union,” Mr McCully says.
