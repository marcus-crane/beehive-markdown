Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today welcomed the opening of nominations for Her Majesty The Queen’s Young Leaders Programme, which aims to discover, celebrate and support young people from Commonwealth countries.

Buckingham Palace is searching for exceptional young leaders from every country in the Commonwealth, and the programme was officially launched in London on July 9 by their Royal Highnesses The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry on behalf of The Queen.

It has been developed in recognition of the 60 years that The Queen has served as Head of the Commonwealth.

“In my role as Youth Affairs Minister, I have had the privilege of meeting many young people who are making positive contributions in their communities,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Queen’s Young Leaders Programme will recognise and celebrate the achievements of a diverse global group of exceptional young people, support them to reach their potential, and create real change in their lives and in the lives of those around them.

“It is an opportunity to recognise our outstanding young New Zealanders, transform their lives, and inspire others around them.”

The programme will identify and celebrate the achievements of inspirational young leaders aged 18-29 who are already working hard to overcome adversity and contributing to their community.

Each year, 60 young people will be selected over the four-year span of the programme  to receive a Queen’s Young Leaders Award, with the chosen 240 promoted as role models to inspire the next generation of young leaders.

Winners will be provided with a tailored package of training, mentoring and networking and will travel to London to attend a one-week residential programme, where they will receive their award from the Queen.

The aim of that visit is to strengthen their skills to enable them to inspire the next generation of young leaders, and to build a network that will keep them engaged as a group beyond the life of the programme.

The programme will also invest in existing projects that support young people who are aiming to create positive change in their communities.

“I hope that many young New Zealanders are nominated for this programme,” Ms Kaye says. “It provides a superb opportunity for some of New Zealand’s young leaders to be recognised on a global stage and to have access to a network of the next generation of young leaders.”
