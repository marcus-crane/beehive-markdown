Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says confirmation work will get underway this year on the 27 kilometre Transmission Gully motorway is great news for all Wellingtonians.

“Today’s signing of a contract between the NZ Transport Agency and The Wellington Gateway Partnership to deliver the highway as a Public Private Partnership brings to an end decades of indecision and delay,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Transmission Gully is a very important section of the Government’s 110km Wellington Northern Gateway Road of National Significance.

“The Northern Gateway will provide a safer, more reliable and efficient highway connection from Wellington to Levin, and is long overdue.

“Transmission Gully will save lives, shorten peak journeys by as much as 15 minutes, remove heavy traffic from a number of local communities and provide a more resilient route that will open more quickly following natural disasters.

“And, as with all the Government’s seven Roads of National Significance, it will make an important economic region of the country more competitive by improving efficiency of movement for people and freight,” Mr Brownlee says.

NZTA and The Wellington Gateway Partnership aim to have Transmission Gully open for traffic by 2020.
