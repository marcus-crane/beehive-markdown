A single unique number for every business and a range of new services that reduce the need for businesses to provide the same information twice are just some of the ways that government is working to make it easier for businesses to interact with them," Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“In 2012, the Government set 10 ambitious targets to be achieved by 2017, one of which was to significantly improve businesses interaction with government (Result 9).

"We’re making some good progress on that work, including the introduction of the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), a single unique number for each business, that will make it much easier to interact with government agencies as well as other businesses."

The NZBN will allow each business to update key information in one place that is then shared across other government agencies – saving time and reducing the frustration of having to provide the same information to multiple agencies.

Other services being introduced to make things easier for businesses when dealing with the Government include Employer Registration, which registers new companies as an employer with Inland Revenue at the same time as they incorporate their company on the Companies Office website.

Another recent innovation recognises the significance of Trans-Tasman trade for New Zealand companies. A mobile app that allows users to search both the Companies Office and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission registers at the same time provides access to more than 2.5 million New Zealand and Australian companies, as well as 1.7 million organisations on the Australian Business Names Register.

“A Result 9 Cabinet paper recently considered by Cabinet provides a roadmap of the programme of work making it easier for businesses to work with government. Actions in the programme focus on more joined-up services across government, fewer touch points for customers, less duplication and a greater focus on providing services centred on the needs of business customers,” Mr Joyce says.
