Revenue Minister Todd McClay has announced Board Dynamics founder, Henri Eliot, as the Chair of the new Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel.

The Panel will give New Zealanders a voice in simplifying, modernising and transforming the way we all pay tax.

Mr Eliot brings with him a wealth of knowledge as an experienced small-to-medium business owner and independent director of numerous SME boards in New Zealand.

He is also an accredited business mentor to SME owners and has played a strategic advisory role to a number of SME’s in New Zealand covering strategic planning, board establishment and investment advisory.

“As a highly respected SME owner and director Mr Eliot will bring to the Panel valuable experience of the challenges that SME’s face within the current tax system,” Mr McClay says.

“I expect the remaining Panel members to be appointed over the next couple of weeks.”

“I am particularly keen that the Panel engage with individual taxpayers and small-to-medium business owners on how we can reduce the amount of time they spend on red-tape and tax compliance.”

“The Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel will help Inland Revenue ensure it is consistent with the objective of making tax compliance faster and easier,” Mr McClay says.
