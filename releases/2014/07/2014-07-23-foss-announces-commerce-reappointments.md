Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced four reappointments to various independent Crown entities and statutory bodies. 

“I am pleased to announce the Governor-General has reappointed Pat Duignan as a member of the Commerce Commission.  Mr Duignan has been on the Commission since 2009 and has valuable experience in the corporate finance sector,” Mr Foss says.

The Governor-General also reappointed Michele Embling and Simon Carey to the External Reporting Board. Ms Embling has been appointed deputy chairperson. 

“Ms Embling and Mr Carey were first appointed to the Board in 2011.  They both have extensive experience in financial reporting,” Mr Foss says.

Former Auditor-General David Macdonald has been reappointed to the Disciplinary Committee established under the Financial Advisers Act 2008.

The Committee conducts disciplinary proceedings for alleged breaches of the Code of Professional Conduct for Authorised Financial Advisers.

All reappointments are for one year. 

Mr Foss also confirmed Simon Allen will remain as chairperson of the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) until a new government appoints his successor. 

“I would like to thank Mr Allen for his continuing leadership and commitment to the FMA,” Mr Foss says.
