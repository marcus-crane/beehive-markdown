Justice Minister Judith Collins is delighted the Justice sector’s efforts to reduce crime and reoffending in the Hutt Valley were recognised at last night’s 2014 IPANZ Awards.

“I congratulate the Ministry of Justice, with New Zealand Police and the Department of Corrections, on winning the Excellence in Achieving Collective Impact Award for the Hutt Valley Justice Sector Innovation Project. 

“The Project is a fantastic example of what we can achieve when agencies work together to deliver better outcomes for New Zealanders.”

Ms Collins says the Project’s success reflects increased collaboration between Police, Justice, Corrections and other agencies and service providers to focus on the specific needs of communities and vulnerable families.

“The Project is about bringing agencies together to identify local solutions to local problems,” Ms Collins says.

“From June 2011 to September 2013 in the Hutt Valley total crime was down 23 per cent. This is excellent news for the Hutt Valley community.”

A ‘Flagship Programme’ based on the Hutt Valley Justice Sector Innovation Project is now underway in Papakura, Hamilton and the East Coast.

Ms Collins also congratulates the Ministry of Justice on winning the Te Puni Kōkiri Award for Excellence in Crown-Māori Relationships for their project ‘Ngāti Hauā settlement of Non-Raupatu historical claims’.
