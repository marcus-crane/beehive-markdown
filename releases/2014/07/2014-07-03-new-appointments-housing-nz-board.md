Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced the appointment of Liz Jones and Peter Dow as two new members of the Housing New Zealand Board, and the reappointment of Whaimutu Dewes.

“A strong board is required to maintain the momentum of the upgrade of Housing New Zealand’s properties and the repair of its 5000 homes in Christchurch. These two new directors bring skills in social housing, property development, governance and finance,” Dr Smith says.

“Housing New Zealand is one of the Government’s largest assets with a portfolio of over $15 billion worth of houses. It houses some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable families. The organisation is going through significant change with the Government’s ambitious social housing reforms. These new directors are needed to ensure the organisation is well-governed.”

The appointments are being gazetted today and take effect from 7 July.
