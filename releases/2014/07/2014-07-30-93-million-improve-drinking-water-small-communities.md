Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced approval of $9.3 million in subsidies to help small communities establish or improve their drinking-water supplies.

“The subsidies have been approved under the 2013/14 Drinking-Water Subsidy Scheme (DWSS) funding round for projects in 22 small communities across the country,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“These subsidies will help council and community water suppliers provide safer drinking-water for over 17,000 people.

“Subsidies approved this year range from almost $2 million for the Taupo District Council to connect Waitahuanui to the council water supply, to just over $15,000 being provided to the Paikea Whitireia Trust to assess and prepare a preliminary design report for the Whangara water supply.”

While most larger drinking-water supplies already provide safe drinking-water, the DWSS assists smaller supplies to optimise the quality of their water.

The DWSS has $10 million available each year until 2015 and will pay up to 85 per cent of costs. Eligibility for the scheme includes communities with a deprivation index of seven and above and where the water supply will serve a permanent population of between 25 and 5000 people.

“As the second-to-last round of the subsidy scheme, I am pleased that this year we have used almost all of the $10 million allocation,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“I encourage communities that may be interested or thinking about applying to check with their local Public Health Unit that they are eligible and ensure their application is submitted before the remaining subsidy round closes on 28 February 2015.”

More information about the scheme and how to apply can be found on the Ministry of Health website [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz).
