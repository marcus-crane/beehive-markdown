Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye today invited seven organisations to participate in a Request for Proposals (RfP) to host the Food Safety Science and Research Centre.

“The Centre is being established to promote, co-ordinate, and deliver food safety science and research, in response to a key recommendation from the Government Inquiry into the Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) Contamination incident,” Ms Kaye says. 

“Progress on establishing the Centre is integral to ensuring New Zealand’s food safety system remains among the best in the world by focusing on cutting-edge, internationally recognised research into key aspects of food safety.

“The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry for Primary Industries are working collaboratively to ensure the best possible host for the Centre. Part of the criteria will be looking at good linkages to international regulators, research organisations and the food industry.”

Following an Expression of Interest (EOI) process, a workshop was held in May with seven research organisations along with representatives from the food industry, government and wider stakeholders.

“The aim of the workshop was to determine how best to establish a Centre that will help ensure New Zealand remains a producer of trusted, high-quality food products,” Mr Joyce says.

The seven organisations that are eligible to respond to the RfP are:

1. AgResearch
2. The Cawthron Institute
3. The Institute of Environmental Science and Research
4. Massey University
5. Plant and Food Research
6. The University of Auckland
7. The University of Otago

“In selecting a research organisation to host the Centre, the Science Board will closely follow criteria that was developed following the workshop discussions,” Mr Joyce says.

“It will be looking for organisations that have the capability and infrastructure to host the Centre. Along with a successful track record in leading collaborations, the host agent will have proven support from both researchers and industry.”

Responses to the RfP are due by 29 August. The Centre is expected to be operational by late 2014.
