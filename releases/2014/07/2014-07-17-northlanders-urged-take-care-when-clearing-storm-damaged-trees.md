Associate Minister Primary Industries Jo Goodhew is urging Northlanders to take extreme care when clearing windthrown trees, and to get in touch with the Ministry if they need safety tips.

The warning follows days of torrential rain and gale force winds, which have battered the region. The storm has impacted around 80% of the primary sector, and as a result has been declared a medium-scale adverse event.

“As the clean-up gets underway, there are widespread reports of uprooted or toppled trees,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“I encourage affected landowners to take extreme care when removing these windthrown trees. These trees are dangerous to work with as they can be unstable and highly unpredictable. Sometimes it may be better to leave the clearing to an expert.

“As it is the school holidays, parents and caregivers should ensure that children understand that storm damaged trees are not a playground.”

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and the Northland Rural Support Trust will conduct training around tree safety if there is interest from landowners. This is an opportunity to learn about machinery, chainsaw use and safe handling of windthrown trees on their property.

“If landowners are interested in this opportunity, I encourage them to get in touch with MPI so demonstrations can be arranged,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Anyone interested in attending a demonstration can contact MPI by calling 0800 008 333 or email [info@mpi.govt.nz](mailto:info@mpi.govt.nz).
