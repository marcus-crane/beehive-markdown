Latest data from the Ministry of Health shows young people with mental health or addiction problems are receiving treatment faster than ever before.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says nine out of ten young people, aged 0-19, needing non-urgent mental health or addiction treatment are being seen within the eight week target.

“This is great for young people and their families – the sooner young people receive treatment and support the sooner they can get back to school, training or their job,” says Mr Ryall.

Ministry of Health data to the year ended March 2014 shows:

- 69 per cent of young people are seen by mental health services within 3 weeks – up from 62 per cent in 2011
- 90 per cent of young people are seen by mental health services within 8 weeks – up from 87 per cent in 2011
- 80 per cent of young people are seen by alcohol and drug services within 3 weeks – up from 62 per cent in 2011
- 93 per cent of young people are seen by alcohol and drug services within 8 weeks – up from 79 per cent in 2011.

“These waiting time improvements are a result of the increased focus provided by the Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health project,” says Mr Ryall. 

“Mental health and addiction services across the country have been working hard to improve waiting times and to make the services more youth friendly.

“We want to help even more young people with mental health, alcohol, drug and other addiction problems. Earlier this year we announced an extra $3 million to enhance current services,” says Mr Ryall.
