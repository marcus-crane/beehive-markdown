Foreign Minister Murray McCully says that the crash of Malaysian Airlines flight MH 17 is a tragedy and has extended condolences on behalf of all New Zealanders to the families of those on board.

“Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade are following up on indications that at least one New Zealand passport holder, and other passengers with New Zealand connections, may have been on board,” Mr McCully says.

“The Ministry is working hard to confirm these details and make contact with the next of kin.

“Our thoughts are with the all families of those on board as they wait for news. Latest reports suggest that more than 295 people may have died in the crash

“It is important that the matter be fully investigated and we call for independent investigators to be allowed access to the crash site,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealanders who believe they had a family member on MH17 and are unable to contact them should talk to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Consular Division on +64 4 439 8000.

Malaysian Airlines have established a Help Line in Kuala Lumpur which concerned family members are also encouraged to call +603 7884 1234.
