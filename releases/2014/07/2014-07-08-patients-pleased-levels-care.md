A three year $900,000 study into prostate cancer care shows most men and their families are pleased with the care they received.

Speaking at the launch of the final report from the Midlands Prostate Cancer Study in Hamilton today, Health Minister Tony Ryall said the study makes very interesting reading and contributes significantly to the evidence base around prostate cancer in New Zealand.

“The study showed good results for men with prostate cancer. There is a high survival rate – with a majority of men surviving over ten years.

“It has also identified areas where we can make future improvements to the work already being done to improve patient care. The report made eighteen recommendations which support the work already underway by the Ministry of Health to improve health outcomes for men with prostate cancer” says Mr Ryall.

“Prostate cancer is the most common cancer amongst New Zealand men and each year, around 3,000 New Zealand men are diagnosed with prostate cancer.

“The government is committed to improving outcomes for these men. We have invested an extra $4.3 million to raise awareness of prostate cancer among men and their families, and to ensure men have better access to quality information and care

“I would like to congratulate Professor Ross Lawrenson and his team of researchers from Auckland University for their excellent work in completing this project and delivering such a comprehensive report.

“This government recognises the value of research to the health of New Zealanders and that’s why we announced $78 million in health research funding as part of the 2014 Health Research Council of New Zealand funding round” says Mr Ryall.

The three year study, commissioned in 2010, was funded by the Ministry of Health and the Health Research Council.
