Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has commended the Road Transport Forum for their *Women in Road Transport Action Plan*, which is geared at attracting more women to the sector.

“Research shows that the transport sector is facing a long-term shortage of at least 1,100 drivers. This projected shortage and the consequent freight delays could have wide economic repercussions.

“This Action Plan will serve as a useful tool as the sector looks to address that shortage by appealing to more women,” says Mrs Goodhew. 

Currently women account for around 16 per cent, or 6,000, of the 34,000 strong road transport workforce. Of our 23,000 heavy truck drivers around three per cent, or 760, are women.

“This Action Plan covers important issues such as increasing the visibility of those women in the industry. It also looks at how to address stereotypes and better support and retain women already in the industry,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The plan also includes a diversity toolkit which includes information on topics such as flexible work-time guidelines, career pathways, tackling shared facilities, safety equipment and uniforms suitable for women.”

The Action Plan was developed with the assistance of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs.

“The Ministry is working with a range of industry representatives as they develop specific strategies to recruit, retain and support more women into roles where they are currently underrepresented,” says Mrs Goodhew.
