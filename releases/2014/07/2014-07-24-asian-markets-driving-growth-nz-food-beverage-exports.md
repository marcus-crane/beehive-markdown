Consumer demand in East and South East Asia for high value foods and beverages is driving export growth and diversification, a new Government report shows.

*‘What does Asia Want for Dinner? Emerging Market Opportunities for New Zealand food & beverages in East & South East Asia’* was released today by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

The report finds that New Zealand’s overall food and beverage export performance to Asia is excellent; performing strongly in dairy, as well as in meat, seafood, produce and processed foods.

“Asia is the fastest growing food market in the world and is increasingly important for New Zealand exports”, Mr Joyce says.

The report looks beyond New Zealand’s core export categories and finds there is strong demand for infant formula, dairy nutritionals and innovative foods. It also shows there are significant opportunities in a range of high value categories such as chilled salmon, honey, chocolate, sparkling wine, beer, avocadoes, alcoholic spirits and cherries.

                                        

Mr Guy says together these categories already generate more than a $1 billion of exports for New Zealand.

“In the past twenty years New Zealand wine, honey, aquaculture, avocados and processed foods have all emerged to be significant new export sectors, and this report shows there are further opportunities in East and South East Asia,” Mr Guy says.

“Through the Business Growth Agenda, the Government has made major investments to drive innovation, productivity and diversification in New Zealand’s food and beverage industry, so that we can continue to meet demand and grow this sector,” Mr Joyce says.

The report is the latest in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Food and Beverage Information Project series, and complements reports already published in the New Zealand Sectors Report Series.
