Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Timor-Leste this week to attend the Summit of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) and then continue on to Glasgow to represent the New Zealand Government at the 20th Commonwealth Games.

“The CPLP Summit will be attended by Heads of State and Ministers from the eight member states from Africa, Europe and South East Asia,” Mr McCully says.

“It will provide an opportunity to engage with these countries on issues like regional integration and economic cooperation, as well as furthering New Zealand’s bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.

“We are very pleased Timor-Leste Prime Minister Gusmao invited New Zealand to attend this event. New Zealand has made a significant contribution to security and development in Timor-Leste, and we have a small but growing trade relationship”

During the visit Mr McCully will meet with Timor-Leste Prime Minister Gusmao, Foreign Minister Guterres, former President Dr Jose Ramos-Horta, and a number of ministerial counterparts from CPLP member states and observers.

The Minister then travels to Glasgow to support the athletes participating in the Commonwealth Games on the evening of Friday the 25th and Saturday the 26th of July.

“There are 235 New Zealand competitors taking part in the 20th Commonwealth Games and we will be represented in all 18 sports on the Glasgow programme.

“In addition to supporting the New Zealand delegation I will be hosting events aimed at boosting the profile, and funding, of high performance sport in New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.
