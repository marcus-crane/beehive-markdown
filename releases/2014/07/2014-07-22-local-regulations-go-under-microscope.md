The Government says it is accepting nearly all of the recommendations the Productivity Commission has made on ways to improve local regulations.

“The quality of local regulation impacts significantly on New Zealand’s economic and social wellbeing.  It affects all aspects of our lives from resource and building consents through to food safety and liquor licensing,” says Regulatory Reform Minister, Bill English.

Mr English says the Government is determined to ensure the local regulatory system is functioning as efficiently and effectively as possible.

“That’s why we asked the commission to provide advice on how we can improve how functions are allocated at a local level and ensure there is adequate resourcing and clear directions on the local and national management of regulations. 

“I’m pleased to announce that we are accepting all but two of the Commission’s recommendations to improve the local regulatory system. 

“The Department of Internal Affairs will work with other government agencies whose policies and legislation impact on local government to improve consultation and minimise any unintended negative impacts.

“Treasury will work with key agencies to consider how the regulatory planning process can be used to provide better information about future regulatory proposals affecting local government,” Mr English says.

Local Government Minister Paula Bennett is also establishing a new Rules Reduction Taskforce that will identify and address bureaucratic and nonsensical rules.

She says the Government has already made some changes to improve the way regulation works at the local level.

“The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 requires councils to coordinate with other monitoring and enforcement agencies.  Changes proposed by the freshwater and resource management reforms will improve the delivery of local regulation in those areas,” says Mrs Bennett.
