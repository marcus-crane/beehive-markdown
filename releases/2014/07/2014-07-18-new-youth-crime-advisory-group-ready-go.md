Justice Minister Judith Collins and Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today announced the appointment of eight members to the new Youth Crime Action Plan Advisory Group.

The Advisory Group will provide advice to Ministers in the area of youth justice to support the implementation of the Government’s Youth Crime Action Plan.

“We are pleased to announce the inaugural members of the Youth Crime Action Plan Advisory Group as Dr Ian Lambie, Anni Watkin, Dr Tracey McIntosh, Steve Boxer, Superintendent Bruce Bird, Chris Rewha, Witi Ashby and Chairperson Jade Hohaia,” says Ms Collins and Mr Borrows.

“Since June 2011, youth crime has fallen 27 per cent. This is the second time we’ve surpassed our Better Public Services target for youth crime – the most recent target being a 25 per cent reduction by 2017,” Ms Collins says.

“The Youth Crime Action Plan Advisory Group will play an important role in helping us maintain this fantastic progress through the implementation of our 10-year action plan.

“Each of these members brings valuable experience to the group, having knowledge of the youth justice sector and strong community networks. This will ensure we have a practical and long-term impact on key challenges.”

“The Youth Crime Action Plan sets three key challenges in youth justice - working better with communities, creating early and sustainable exits from the system and reducing unnecessary escalation of young offenders,” says Mr Borrows.

“Government agencies will work together more closely and partner with communities (including iwi), parents, schools and others to address youth crime and the factors that lead to offending.

“We look forward to working with the Youth Crime Action Plan Advisory Group to ensure that our children and youth don’t start down the path to a life of crime.”

The Advisory Group comprises up to ten members, appointed by the Minister of Justice.
