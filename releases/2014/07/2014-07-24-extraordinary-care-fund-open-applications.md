Extraordinary Care Fund grants to help children being raised by their grandparents or extended family open for application soon, Social Development Minister Paula Bennett confirmed today.

“The Extraordinary Care Fund recognises the amazing job that grandparents and extended family members do raising children who come into their care, often because of the death of a parent or because of abuse or neglect,” Mrs Bennett said.

“It’s designed to provide a boost for children who may be showing promise in areas like arts or sport, or for those needing some extra help, like tutoring at school.”

From 4 August carers receiving the Orphan’s Benefit or Unsupported Child’s Benefit can apply for up to $2,000 a year for a child in their care.

Around 12,700 children are being cared for by extended family members like grandparents, and from next week letters will be sent to around 8,800 carers advising them when and how to apply.

“It’s a difficult task raising vulnerable children who’ve had a tough start to life and many of these carers have opened their homes after already raising their own children,” Mrs Bennett said.

‘The fund offers them a bit of extra support so the children in their care have the opportunity to reach their full potential, and thrive.” 

The Extraordinary Care Fund is part of a wider package of extra support for carers announced last year which also included payments to help with school costs at the start of the year.
