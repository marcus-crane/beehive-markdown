Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today welcomed the Joint Border Management System reaching another milestone.

More than 50 per cent of inward border transactions are now being processed through the Trade Single Window component of the system, which allows importers and exporters to submit shipment details electronically to a single point of contact, rather than dealing with several government agencies.

“It is great traders are migrating steadily to the Trade Single Window, and the 673,000 inward transactions through it to date is ahead of the initial forecasts.

“We have had strong support from major exporters and industry partners, who are seeing benefits such as the elimination of data duplication, a reduction in transaction costs and improved response times, Ms Wagner says.

The average transaction time through the Trade Single Window is less than 30 seconds.

Further elements of the Joint Border Management System will be added between now and December 2015, in line with agreed industry priorities.
