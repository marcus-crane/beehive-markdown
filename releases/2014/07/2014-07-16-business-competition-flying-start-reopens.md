Small Business Minister Steven Joyce today announced business.govt.nz’s ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition is back for its fourth year.

“The competition is seeking innovative and viable business ideas that are geared for growth and sustainable revenue, with more than $65,000 in incentives available to successful applicants,” Mr Joyce says.

“We want the business ideas that can make a positive contribution to the local, national or global economy to help grow jobs in New Zealand.

“Small businesses are vitally important to New Zealand and represent nearly 30 per cent of New Zealand’s gross domestic product.

The competition is open to businesses and start-ups with an annual turnover of less than $1 million, or people with an idea to get off the ground.

“Entries are open until 12 August 2014 and I encourage as many small businesses as possible to get involved. Over the last three years the competition has seen nearly 2,000 businesses compete for over $200,000 in prizes,” says Mr Joyce.

The competition is managed by business.govt.nz – the first-stop-shop for small businesses with expert advice, information and tools from across government all in one place. Business.govt.nz is a key part of the Better Public Services for Business (Result 9) programme which aims to make life easier for businesses to interact with government.
