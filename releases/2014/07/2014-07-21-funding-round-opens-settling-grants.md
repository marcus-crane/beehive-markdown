Local providers and community groups are now invited to apply for Settling In grants to provide migrant and refugee settlement services, Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Settling In grants are awarded to community groups that help the Government’s focus on building the capability and capacity of refugee and migrant communities at a local level.

“This Government is committed to ensuring opportunities and tools are available for all New Zealanders to participate, thrive and gain independence,” says Ms Collins.

“Part of this strategy is supporting local projects or initiatives that address some of the barriers to settlement refugee and migrant communities may face.

“Settling In grants are awarded for one-off projects or shorter term initiatives to help communities to become confident and independent.”

While there is no limit to the amount of funding an organisation can apply for, to date the average Settling In grant has been about $28,000 of the overall annual fund of $520,000.

“This is the first year the Office of Ethnic Affairs (OEA) is managing the programme and there will be a shift to a more transparent process for allocating Settling In grants,” Ms Collins says.

“OEA has close connections with ethnic communities throughout New Zealand which will enable the targeting of grants to communities where they are most needed.”

Applications for 2014 Settling In grants are welcome up until 29 August from not-for-profit organisations and those with a public benefit purpose. Proposals need to be directly relevant to the nominated community.
