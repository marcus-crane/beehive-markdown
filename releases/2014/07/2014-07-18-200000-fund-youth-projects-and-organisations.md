Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has today opened Youth Fund 2015 with $200,000 available for community projects.

“The Ministry of Youth Development’s Youth Fund is unique in that it supports projects designed and led by young people aged 12 to 24, or projects by youth organisations in partnership with young people that develop community participation,” Ms Kaye says.

“Panels of young people will assess applications to determine successful projects and where the funding will go, resulting in a completely youth-led initiative.

“The more opportunities we can give young people to participate in decision-making and get involved in service in their communities, the better.”

Youth Fund 2014 funded 47 projects last year, from the Pheonix Performing Arts – a programme of workshops and mentoring for young people involved in the performing arts – to the INSPIRE youth mentoring conference.  A Westland Rural Education Activities programme, the conference taught Grey and Westland districts youth a range of skills in events management, communication, and financial management.

More than 7000 young people participated in the Youth Fund 2014 projects.

“We cannot underestimate the value to our country of investing in young leaders,” Ms Kaye says, “particularly through projects where young Kiwis lead the way in solving problems in their communities.

“This funding, along with other Government initiatives such as the $2.5 million Youth Enterprise Initiative that was announced in Budget 2014, is giving young people opportunities to upskill and make a positive contribution to their communities.”

The funding available for each project in the 2015 Youth Fund ranges from $2000 to $7000. Projects must begin from 1 January 2015 and be completed by 30 June 2015.

Applications close on 11 September 2014.
