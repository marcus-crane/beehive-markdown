Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand has used a special sitting of the United Nations Security Council to call for a full investigation into the crash of flight MH17.

"The crash of flight MH17 claimed the lives of 298 passengers and crew members, including one New Zealand citizen and one New Zealand resident," Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand's statement to the Security Council overnight expressed outrage at the mounting evidence that this tragedy resulted from a surface to air missile strike.

"We also reiterated our calls for the protection of the crash site to allow for a thorough and credible international investigation.

"Yesterday I instructed Ministry officials to call in the most senior representative from the Russian Embassy in Wellington, and to call the Ukrainian Embassy in Canberra.

“Officials used these discussions to clearly convey New Zealand's expectation that all nations will cooperate with an independent international investigation into the crash of MH17,” Mr McCully says.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed that one of the passengers on MH17 is a New Zealand citizen normally resident in Australia. The family has requested privacy and the Ministry is not releasing further details.

A British national, a long-term resident of New Zealand, was also on the flight.

Consular assistance is being provided to both families.

The Ministry has no immediate concerns there were other New Zealanders on board flight MH17.
