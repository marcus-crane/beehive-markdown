Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today launched the Government’s new Māori and Pasifika Trades Training initiative for Rotorua.

The SkillMe consortium led by Waiariki Institute of Technology in partnership with Te Taumata o Ngāti Whakaue Iho Ake Trust, Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiarangi and Taumarunui Community Kokiri Trust, has been set up to get more young Maori and Pasifika into apprenticeships and employment.

“With our economy growing strongly there is a real need for skilled trades people, particularly with the demand for new housing in Auckland and with the Christchurch rebuild,” Mr Joyce says.

“Maori and Pasifika Trades Training is about getting young people successfully through trades training and into apprenticeships and stable employment while meeting the skills needs of regional employers.”

Carpentry students of the SkillME Māori and Pasifika Trades Training initiative (Rotorua) will gain real life experience by building a house from the ground up under the watchful eye of tutors and local builders. Students will complete a year-long Certificate in Carpentry and look to gain employment and potentially an apprenticeship in carpentry.

“The Government is committed to using our growing economy to raise the standard of living for all New Zealanders. The SkillME course offers a pathway into sustainable employment that will benefit young, local Māori and Pacific men and women, and their whanau, right through their working lives,” Mr Joyce says.

“I am also impressed that the course will result in a completed house being sold for charity."

The SkillMe consortium is one of twelve around the country delivering the Government's $43 million Māori and Pasifika Trades Training initiative which will provide 3000 places by 2015.  Consortia are operating in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Rotorua, the East Coast, Hawkes Bay, Greater Wellington and Canterbury.

The initiative brings together tertiary education providers, Māori and/or Pasifika organisations and employers.  Their role is to ensure training is aligned to the needs of employers and learners, and leverages the knowledge and networks of Māori, Pasifika and other community groups to recruit and support learners.
