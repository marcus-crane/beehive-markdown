Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced three appointments to the Library and Information Advisory Commission (LIAC).

“I am pleased to announce that Haneta Pierce, Carolyn Robertson and Helen Tait have been appointed for one-year terms.  I believe their extensive experience will be of great benefit to LIAC”.

“LIAC’s role is to advise me on the latest developments and opportunities within the library and information sector.  I consider that it remains well placed to handle the challenges ahead,” said Mr Dunne.

Mr Dunne thanked the outgoing members Sharman Buckle and Haromi Williams for their expertise and contribution.
