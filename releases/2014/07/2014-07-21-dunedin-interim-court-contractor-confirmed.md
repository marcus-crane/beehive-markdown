Courts Minister Chester Borrows has welcomed the announcement of a South Island building company as the main contractor in the next stage of the Dunedin Court complex’s refurbishment.

Amalgamated Builders Construction Ltd will undertake the work on the 184 High St building that provides further courtrooms with support and custodial areas, in addition to the already operating jury court.

“The Dunedin courthouse is an icon of the city, and keeping court operations running while ensuring this building is safe and fit for purpose has presented the Ministry of Justice with huge challenges,” says Mr Borrows.

“I acknowledge that it hasn’t been an easy process for the legal community, which has faced some disruption since parts of the courthouse were closed in December 2011, when a seismic assessment raised concerns about the building’s safety.

“Once completed, this latest stage of work will mean that all District and High Court matters will be heard at 184 High St.”

The work programme for this latest $3.2 million stage of the interim facility will now be finalised and an expected date will be advised shortly.

Jury trials returned to the building last year, having being held in Invercargill since early 2012. The work programme will take that into account, ensuring there is minimal disruption inside the courtroom.

Until the High St work is completed the Family Court will continue to operate out of John Wickliffe House. Coronial inquests, Disputes Tribunal and District and Youth Courts continue at the Stuart St building.

“We remain committed to Dunedin and I want to acknowledge the support and patience shown by ministry staff, the judiciary, local government, lawyers, Police, Corrections staff and other court users over the past few years. Their efforts have ensured court services have kept running as well as they have,” says Mr Borrows.

Structural engineering design and geotechnical work are continuing at the Stuart St courthouse.
