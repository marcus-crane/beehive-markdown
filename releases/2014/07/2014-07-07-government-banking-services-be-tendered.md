Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an all-of-government banking services solution.

“Core banking services for government haven’t been tendered for over 20 years and banking trends and technology have evolved considerably during this time,” Mr Joyce says.

“This RFP, released via GETS today, is an opportunity for payments and banking suppliers to work with government to put in place a modern banking solution that is flexible enough to accommodate future innovation.”

Mr Joyce says taking to market the banking business of core government agencies is a significant achievement in itself which will provide greater opportunities for better financial payment interaction between government, business and taxpayers.

“Providing opportunities for all government agencies under the planned new cross-government contracts will assist the Government’s better public services goal of making it easier for individuals and businesses to interact with government,” Mr Joyce says.

“An all-of-government banking solution is part of the wider Government Procurement Reform Programme aimed at making government buying as efficient as possible, encouraging innovation, reducing costs and improving competition.”

Given the major transformation programme Inland Revenue is already currently undertaking, its banking services in relation to Crown Revenue will remain with Westpac for the duration of the initial eight year term of the Transactional Banking Services contract. However Inland Revenue will participate in all of the sub-categories, including transactional banking for departmental expenses, card services and foreign exchange transactions. All other core crown agencies will participate in full in the new contract.

Respondents have at least 60 working days to complete the RFP which closes on 10 October 2014.
