Diplomat Jonathan Curr has been appointed as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Turkey Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“Our relationship with Turkey is important and diverse dealing with a range of political and trade issues as well as our shared World War One history. 

“Next year marks the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign and a substantial number of New Zealanders will be travelling to Turkey. This will be an important milestone in the strong modern partnership between our two countries.

“A key focus for the new Ambassador will be advancing our trade and economic connections.

“In addition to Turkey, Mr Curr will be accredited to Israel, Jordan, Georgia and Azerbaijan. He will also be New Zealand’s representative to the Palestinian Authority.”

Mr Curr is currently the Unit Manager of the Middle East and Africa Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has been previously posted to Tonga and Egypt, is an Arabic speaker and has a strong background in the Middle East region.
