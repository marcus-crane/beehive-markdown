Minister of Internal Affairs Peter Dunne welcomed the announcement by NZForex that it will use the *RealMe* service as a further endorsement of this increasingly successful government service. NZForex said that *RealMe* will improve the speed and convenience of making international money transfers.

“*RealMe* is a core component of the Government’s drive to deliver better, faster online services. Large trading banks and the financial services sector have been early adopters of the RealMe service.

“They have clearly recognised the benefits for their customers, who will experience a more convenient, simplified sign up service, and for their business which will benefit through increased efficiency, reduced administrative costs and reduced risk,” says Mr Dunne.

Law changes in 2012 enabled approved private entities to use *RealMe as* an online identity verification service which means customers don’t need to supply identity documents to prove who they are. Banks and finance companies can use *RealMe* to meet the requirements for electronic identity verification set out under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism legislation.

*RealMe* enables proof of identity online to a high degree of confidence. It is the online equivalent of walking up to a counter and showing your passport. It also enables people to login to multiple online services securely with a single username and password.

*“RealMe* is another example of better public services making life easier for New Zealanders. It protects people’s privacy by not storing their information. Instead, it just passes it on securely when people want to prove who they are. I look forward to more businesses signing up to this innovative service in the near future”, says Mr Dunne.
