Police Minister Anne Tolley has presented special commemorative service awards to the five Chinese police staff that helped identify victims following the Christchurch earthquake in 2011. 

The Canterbury Earthquake Dress Distinction Ribbon was presented to disaster specialists at a ceremony hosted by the Ministry of Public Security’s Forensic Centre in Beijing.

“It was an honour to present these awards to Chinese Police staff, and to acknowledge the 23 Chinese victims who lost their lives during the Christchurch earthquake,” says Mrs Tolley.

“At the peak of the rescue effort, Christchurch hosted 900 rescue workers from around the world, who worked closely with the New Zealand and Australian staff in the city.

“The 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Citation recognises the risks and difficult circumstances endured by these workers.

“I was pleased to be able to thank the Chinese Police staff in person for their  incredible spirit, actions and outstanding contribution.

“As well as honouring Chinese Police, we also remembered all of the Christchurch earthquake victims, and those who lost their lives in the devastating Sichuan earthquake of 2008.”
