Health Minister Tony Ryall met with mums at a Plunket group in Wellington to launch the new Well Child Tamariki Ora health book – the first major revision to the book in over quarter of a century.

“The book, commonly known as a Plunket book, provides up-to-date information and advice for new parents on a range of topics from teething and toilet training to postnatal depression and car seat safety,” says Mr Ryall.

“Developed by experts in safety and child health, this book is an invaluable resource to parents who are learning on the job and those with a little more experience.

“These books aren’t just important health records they are family treasures that record a baby’s first years of life.

“This is the most substantial revision to the book since the 1990s. Not only does it contain more information, there have also been changes to the design to make it easier for parents to use.

“I would like to thank Plunket, Tamariki Ora, New Zealand College of Midwives, the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners and parents from across the country for their work on the revision,” says Mr Ryall.

The Well Child Tamariki Ora health book, previously called the Plunket book, has been given free to all parents since the 1920s. It provides parents with a record of their child’s health and development.

The new books will be given to new parents from today.
