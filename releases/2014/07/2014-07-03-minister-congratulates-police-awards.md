Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated Police for their success in the 2014 IPANZ awards, which included the Prime Minister’s award for their Prevention First model.

This top award acknowledges public sector excellence and excellence in improving public value through business transformation.

Overall, Police were successful in four categories, on their own and alongside justice sector partners.

“The recognition for Prevention First, and its results for our communities, is thoroughly deserved,” says Mrs Tolley.

“As a result of this major operational change, which focuses on preventing crime before it takes place, recorded crimes have fallen by over 20 per cent in the last four years.

“Using intelligence-gathering, Police deploy staff in areas where they know crime is likely to take place. Police foot patrols increased by 155 per cent from 2011 to 2013.

“This means Police have the right people in the right areas at the right time to prevent crime, and to prevent members of the public from becoming victims of crime.

“And thanks to the rollout of smartphones and tablets, as well as access to tasers and firearms, Police are also better-equipped to tackle crime and keep themselves and the public safe.

“It was also heartening to see the close working relationships of the justice sector partners – Police, Corrections and Justice – recognised in the IPANZ awards, as we continue to look at ways to deliver safer communities.”
