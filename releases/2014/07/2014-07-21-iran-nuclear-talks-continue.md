Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the decision by the P5+1 (United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) and Iran to continue negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme.

“While it is disappointing that agreement has not been reached by the 20 July deadline, this was always going to be difficult given the complexity of the issues involved,” Mr McCully says.

“These negotiations are complex as they deal both with the technical aspects of Iran’s nuclear programme and the need to rebuild trust between Iran and the international community.

“What matters is that both sides are continuing to talk.  New Zealand supports fully this commitment to reaching a comprehensive agreement. An end to sanctions, and the normalisation of our bilateral relationship, depends on this agreement being reached,” Mr McCully says.
