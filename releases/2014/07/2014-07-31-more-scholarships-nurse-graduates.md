The government is investing an extra $1.5 million to give 25 graduate nurses scholarships to work in general practices in some of New Zealand’s higher need communities next year.

Health Minister Tony Ryall made the announcement today during a visit to Badar Drive Health Care in Mangere.

“Last year, we invested an extra $16 million over four years to support general practices that offer low-cost consultations to some of our most vulnerable communities,” says Mr Ryall.

“In addition, we invested $2.4 million for a one-off scholarship fund for 48 graduate nurses to work in Very Low Cost Access (VLCA) practices – this was the first time scholarships like this has ever been offered.

“The feedback from general practices and graduate nurses has been so positive we are investing extra money to offer scholarships again next year.

“This National-led Government is committed to providing more New Zealanders with affordable general practice care and we acknowledge the important role of nurses working with high need communities,” says Mr Ryall.

The scholarships will be for 12 months, starting from January next year. The recruitment process will starts mid- August, the same time the district health boards' nurse graduate recruitment process starts.

Funding for the VLCA scheme has almost doubled over the past six years – from $27 million in 2007/08 to $50 million this financial year.
