The Crown and Ngāi Tuhoe have announced the appointment of the inaugural members of Te Urewera Board, which will be the primary decision maker for Te Urewera under legislation passed in the House today.

Te Urewera Bill provides for Te Urewera to be established as a legal identity, with its own intrinsic values, and vests the current National Park land in that identity.

The Board will be the primary decision maker for Te Urewera. It is charged with governing Te Urewera so as to strengthen the connection between Tūhoe and Te Urewera, preserve its ecosystems and biodiversity, and provide for continued public use and recreation.

“Recognising Te Urewera has its own identity confirms Tuhoe’s view that it is not something which anyone owns,” Te Uru Taumatua Chair Tamati Kruger said. “Te Urewera exists in its own right, and we as Tuhoe and New Zealanders have the responsibility to recognise its mana and commit to its care and protection.”

“This bill recognises that Te Urewera is treasured by Tūhoe people and by the nation as a whole,” Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson said. “The Crown and Tuhoe look forward to working with the Board to seek UNESCO biosphere status for Te Urewera.”

Four members of the inaugural Te Urewera Board were appointed by Mr Finlayson and Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith, and four members were appointed by Tūhoe Te Uru Taumatua (the Tūhoe governance entity).

The membership of the Board reflects both the relationship of Tūhoe to their homeland of Te Urewera, and the significance to the nation of this distinctive and remote natural area. 

Te Urewera Bill replaces the National Parks Act 1980 as the primary legislation providing for the governance and management of Te Urewera. It gives effect to redress provided for in the historical settlement agreed by the Crown and Tūhoe.

The Board members are Tamati Kruger, Matthew Te Pou, Lorna Taylor, Te Tokawhakāea Temara, Rt Hon Jim Bolger, John Wood, Dave Bamford and,  Jo Breese. The Board will choose its chair from among the Tūhoe appointees.

“This is a significant but very positive change for the natural treasures in the Te Urewera,” Dr Smith said. “The government’s management of this area has been contentious and divisive given its sorry past. This is a very experienced Board capable of moving on from this difficult history and enabling Tūhoe and the Crown to work together on its future governance and management.”

The Board members are appointed for a three year term. After the initial term, the Board’s membership will change to comprise six members appointed by Tūhoe and three appointed by the Minister of Conservation. The chair will be selected from among the Tūhoe appointees.

The Te Urewera Board will be established when the Te Urewera Act takes effect, which is expected to be late September.
