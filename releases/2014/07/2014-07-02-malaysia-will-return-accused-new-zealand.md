Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the announcement from Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah that the official accused of an attack on a young woman in Wellington will be returned to New Zealand.

“Earlier this evening I spoke with Minister Anifah and he advised me that the Malaysian authorities will be returning the official in question to New Zealand to assist with our investigation,” Mr McCully says.

“I want to convey my thanks to the Malaysian Government for this very welcome development which underlines the good faith and integrity with which they have approached this issue.

“There was never any intention by either Government to let this matter rest, and regardless of whether the process took place in Malaysia or New Zealand there was a strong commitment to seeing justice done. The Malaysian authorities have offered their assistance with the on-going investigation and I welcome their continued involvement.

“It must be noted that the accused has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and deserves the right to a fair trial.

“The young woman involved has been through a great deal and the way this matter has been handled has only added to her suffering. I hope she, and her family, will welcome news that the accused will return to New Zealand so the matter can be fully investigated as was always the Government’s intention.

“This is now a matter for the Police and the Courts and I will not be commenting further,” Mr McCully says.
