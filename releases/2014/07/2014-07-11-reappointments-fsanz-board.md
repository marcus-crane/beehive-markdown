Minister for Food Safety Nikki Kaye today announced the reappointment of Andrew McKenzie and Neil Walker to the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) Board.

Dr McKenzie has a background in veterinary public health, food safety, food regulation, international and financial management.  He has extensive knowledge of the New Zealand food regulation system having led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority from its inception in 2002 until 2010.

Mr Walker is a food scientist and has spent 35 years working in senior roles in New Zealand’s dairy industry.  He has strong governance experience and has been a chair, director, trustee and committee member of public councils and authorities.

The reappointments were proposed by New Zealand in a formal process that required acceptance by the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation.

“Both Dr McKenzie and Mr Walker have made a considerable contribution to the Board,” Ms Kaye says. “I am delighted to have retained their expertise and experience, and that the Board will continue to have this high calibre of representation from New Zealand.

“The work that FSANZ does in developing trans-Tasman standards for food composition and labelling for packaged and unpackaged food is incredibly important. Having a food standards system that is used in both New Zealand and Australia means that there is generally one set of rules for both countries, which enables greater efficiencies for businesses.

“It also means that we are able to co-operate closely in areas like food science and in the development of programmes such as the new Health Star Rating system that New Zealand is adopting.”

FSANZ is an agency established to administer trans-Tasman food standards and is governed by a statutory Board of 12: [www.foodstandards.gov.au/about/board/Pages/default.aspx](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/about/board/Pages/default.aspx)
