Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says 157 people across the country have so far taken up the Government’s 3K to Christchurch scheme.

“It is early days but there’s no doubt the incentive payment of $3,000 to help people with moving and establishing themselves in Canterbury is paying off for those individuals now working as well as the region.

“Most of the jobseekers have been employed in construction with 91 jobs.  Other industries benefiting from the scheme include retail, transport, manufacturing, administration and support services.

“It’s particularly pleasing to see young people taking up the opportunity with 50 young people aged 16-24 years making the move to Christchurch.  I’m also encouraged that older workers are getting jobs with 39 people over the age of 40 years securing roles.

“Most of the jobseekers are coming from the Southern, Nelson, Wellington and Bay of Plenty regions.  Males make up the majority with 134 men and 23 women employed.

“Almost all of the new workers have found their own accommodation, with friends or family or privately. 

“So far the Government’s invested $471,000 since the scheme began on 1 July.

“The 3K to Christchurch scheme is proving a win-win for beneficiaries and the Canterbury region as it rebuilds,” says Mrs Bennett.
