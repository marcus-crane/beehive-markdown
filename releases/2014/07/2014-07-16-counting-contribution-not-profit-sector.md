Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew and Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner are welcoming Statistics New Zealand’s decision to update its official measure of the not-for-profit sector.

“Community groups are the backbone of our sports and social groups, emergency service organisations, conservation, and the arts and cultural sector. These institutions, and the people who are part of them, make a significant contribution to New Zealand society and the economy,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Statistics NZ last released official statistics on the not-for-profit sector in 2007 with the Non-profit Institutions Satellite Account: 2004.

The report found there were 97,000 not-for-profit organisations in New Zealand, contributing $6.95 billion or 4.9% to the country’s Gross Domestic Product. At that time over one million people did some voluntary work, and over 105,000 people did paid work for a not-for-profit.

“As the Satellite Account is based on data collected a decade ago it is now timely for work to begin on updating it using recent data from a range of sources," says Ms Wagner.

“Due to the diversity of the not-for-profit sector it is estimated that the project will take around 18 months, but it will be easier to determine the release date once work is further along.

“Statistics NZ will keep the not-for-profit sector informed on their progress.”

“I commend Statistics NZ for taking on this fairly large, but important review. The update will give a more accurate picture of the size, structure and economic contribution of non-profit institutions, including how many there are, how many people they employ, and the level of volunteer input,” says Mrs Goodhew.
