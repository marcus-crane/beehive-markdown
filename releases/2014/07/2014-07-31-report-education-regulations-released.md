A report looking at how improved legislation and regulation could free-up schools to focus more on raising student achievement has been welcomed by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

The Taskforce on Regulations Affecting School Performance, which was established late last year, considered the current regulatory system schools operate under to see if the Government can ease their operating environment and provide more fit for purpose regulation for 21st century requirements.

“Amendments to the Education Act 1989 almost every year have resulted in a long and unwieldy piece of legislation,” Ms Parata says.

“We need to make sure that both the Act and the wider regulatory framework for schools reflect the current educational environment and practices, as well as the diversity of students and their learning needs.”

Following consultation with the education sector, the Taskforce concluded that there is a strong case for reviewing the Act to provide greater focus on student outcomes and more clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those working in the sector.

It also recommended a number of regulatory changes to ensure enough flexibility in the education system to keep pace with the ever-changing environment.

“Any review of the Act would require an extensive consultation process with the education sector and with parents. I have asked the Ministry to provide advice on a potential review of the Act and the other recommendations in the report by November 2014,” Ms Parata says.

“As part of that advice, the Ministry will be asked to provide an indication of whether there are areas of the review that, along with the sector, it is agreed can be progressed sooner.

“I would like to thank the Taskforce members for the very considered approach they took and for applying their time and expertise to deliver such a comprehensive and thoughtful report.”
