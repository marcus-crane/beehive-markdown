The Government and the commercial pork industry have committed to a partnership to strengthen biosecurity, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

The Deed of the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) on Biosecurity Readiness and Response was signed by New Zealand Pork at its annual conference today.

“This enables New Zealand Pork and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) to make joint decisions on biosecurity readiness and response activities. It means we can focus on the areas of greatest priority to the pork industry,” Mr Guy says.

“What it means in practice is a stronger, more effective biosecurity system. Those with a direct stake in biosecurity can now be directly involved in decision making and funding.

“New Zealand Pork has been a strong supporter of GIA and is already actively involved in readiness and biosecurity initiatives such as the industry steering committee on the Foot and Mouth readiness programme.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister and this is another step forward. Protecting our borders from pests and diseases is crucial to so many of our important industries.

“This is the second signing of the GIA Deed after the kiwifruit industry signed in May this year, and I’m looking forward to seeing more industries sign up.

“I’m very pleased the pork industry are stepping forward to contribute their time, expertise, and resources to strengthen biosecurity in partnership with the Government.”
