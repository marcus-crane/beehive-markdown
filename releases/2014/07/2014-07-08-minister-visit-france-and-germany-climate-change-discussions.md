Climate Change Minister Tim Groser departs today to attend the Major Economies Forum (MEF) on Energy and Climate in Paris, followed by a visit to Berlin to participate in the Fifth Petersburg Climate Dialogue.

The MEF brings together 17 of the world’s largest economies to hold discussions about international negotiations for a new climate change agreement.  The US convenes the meeting several times a year, and New Zealand is invited as a special participant.

“While New Zealand is not one of the major economies, our ideas and contributions to the negotiations are highly valued,” Mr Groser says.

“The meeting will be an opportunity for us to influence the negotiations and ensure that the final agreement includes fair rules for the land-sector, particularly forestry.”

In the margins of the MEF, Mr Groser will meet with his French counterparts to develop ideas on agriculture.

Following Paris, Mr Groser will travel to Berlin to participate in the Fifth Petersburg Climate Dialogue which combines a cross section of 30-40 Ministers and plays an important role in setting the agenda for the coming year’s negotiations.

“New Zealand’s influence on climate change in these negotiations far outweighs our contribution to global emissions, and I look forward to participating in identifying areas where progressive steps can be taken to move negotiations along,” says Mr Groser.
