The Data Futures Forum has delivered a range of thought-provoking recommendations on the use of data in New Zealand, Finance Minister Bill English and Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner say.

The forum, an advisory group comprising public and private sector experts, delivered its third and final report to the Government today.

“It shows New Zealand has the opportunity to be a world leader in the sharing of data held by government, with high ethical and privacy standards,” Mr English says.

The Data Futures Forum was established in February to consider how to unlock opportunities through greater data sharing. The initiative is part of the Government’s wider programme to deliver better results from public spending.

“We are already seeing the benefits that more intelligent use of data can deliver – for example the actuarial valuation of the welfare system is supporting early interventions that avoid bigger costs later.”

Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner says the Data Futures Forum has come up with a number of interesting ideas.

“With the opportunity around the greater use of data goes responsibility. We’re aware of the genuine concerns about the way data is shared and managed. This report has made concrete recommendations that will be of interest to New Zealanders and I encourage them to read it,” Ms Wagner says.

“We thank the Forum members, under the leadership of John Whitehead, for their efforts. The Government will fully consider the report before responding.”
