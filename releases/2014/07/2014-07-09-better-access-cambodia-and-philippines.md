Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says Cabinet approval of two new air services agreements will make it easier for New Zealanders to travel and do business in Cambodia and the Philippines.

“These agreements help provide New Zealanders with better access to South East Asia, providing for enhanced trade and tourism links,” Mr Brownlee says.

“New Zealand and the Philippines have a long and close relationship, and the enhancement of the air services arrangements is a further demonstration of this.”

The Philippines agreement is a significant improvement to previous arrangements with the Philippines.  For services between Auckland and Manila, phased increases in the number of weekly flights permitted will rise from seven flights at present to 21 flights in 2020. 

There are now no flight restrictions for services between all other points in New Zealand and the Philippines.  The agreement also enhances code-share arrangements to permit code-sharing with third country carriers.

“More than 40,000 Filipinos live in New Zealand and this agreement will make it easier for friends and relatives to visit each other in both countries,” Mr Brownlee says.

The new agreement with Cambodia places no limits on flights and routes operated by airlines including destinations between and beyond both countries.  It will also allow airlines to pursue code-sharing arrangements to fly to and from Cambodia, including with third-country carriers.

“This is our first air services agreement with Cambodia, and is among the most open agreements we have with our bilateral partners in South East Asia,” Mr Brownlee says.

Both the Cambodian and Philippines agreements continue the government’s efforts to implement its International Air Transport Policy announced in August 2012.

“Since 2012, 32 new or amended agreements have been negotiated,” Mr Brownlee says.
