Prime Minister John Key has announced the appointment of Ben Keith as Deputy Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

The appointment was made by the Governor General and is for a term of three years.  Ben Keith starts in his new role today, 2 July 2014. 

“This is the first appointment to this position, which was newly created with amendments to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1996 in September last year,” says Mr Key.

Mr Keith comes to the position from Crown Law, where he has most recently been Crown Counsel for constitutional, human rights and international law.  He had served in other Crown Counsel, Associate Crown Counsel and Assistant Crown Counsel roles in Crown Law since 2000 and before that had been an associate in a private law firm.

The appointment of Mr Keith was made after consultation with Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, as is required by statute.

“I am confident that Mr Keith will work with recently appointed Inspector-General Cheryl Gwyn to strengthen further this important office, providing independent oversight of New Zealand’s intelligence community at a time when it is subject to significant change and increased public scrutiny,” says Mr Key.
