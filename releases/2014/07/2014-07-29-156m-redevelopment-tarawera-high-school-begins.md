Today is significant for the Kawerau community with a ceremony to mark the start of construction of new facilities at Tarawera High School,  Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“The $15.6 million redevelopment of the school reflects the importance the Government  places on raising student achievement in Kawerau and on providing a fresh start for the school and local community.

“The state-of-the-art facilities will replace approximately 60 percent of the school’s existing buildings, and will preserve the educational future of Kawerau’s young people,” Ms Kaye says.

“The redevelopment will produce a modern learning environment that allows for greater collaboration and interaction. Vibrant, well-connected learning spaces are a key part of the design, and will provide flexible spaces that allow for a variety of teaching and learning methods.”

The new facilities will include modern teaching spaces for 525 students, a library, technology and performance spaces, a wharenui, an administration block, and a wireless fibre network.

The redevelopment will also feature a number of environmentally sustainable initiatives. Specific heating and ventilation initiatives have been implemented to help combat Kawerau’s extreme temperatures. Passive solar heating will be generated via glazing systems that take advantage of the sun.

Tarawera High School opened in January 2013 following extensive community consultation on the closure of Kawerau College and Kawerau Intermediate School.

“The redeveloped school will be one that encourages strong ties with the community and promotes the fulfilment of potential in the community’s rangatahi,” Ms Kaye says.

“It has been designed to engage with the area’s unique landscape and history. The buildings are located on a lay line running from Putuaki to Maketu on the Bay of Plenty coast, and are oriented to maximise the school’s connection with Kawerau’s town centre.”

Work is expected to begin in September and to be completed by the end of 2015.
