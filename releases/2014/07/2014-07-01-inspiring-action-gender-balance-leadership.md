Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew is calling on business leaders to focus on creating pathways to leadership for more women in New Zealand.

“Gender balance in our organisations is vital for building and sustaining our competitive and innovative edge in an increasingly challenging and volatile global market,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Business leaders need to acknowledge the advantage of gender balance – including better productivity and improved business performance.

“Organisations like the New Zealand Defence Force and the BNZ are leading the way by implementing the right business practices and policies in their organisations, and in their teams, to encourage leadership pathways for women,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew is hosting a panel debate titled Inspiring Action: More Women in Leadership, as part of the Sir Peter Blake Leadership Week this evening.

Included are leaders such as Sina Wendt-Moore, Chief Executive, Leadership New Zealand; Kim Ngarimu, Director, Tāua Ltd; Phil O’Reilly, Chief Executive, Business New Zealand and Alistair Carruthers, CNZM Chief Executive, Kensington Swan.

The panel debate builds on the latest report from the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, *Inspiring action: actions plans and research to help you attract and retain talented women*.

This report, available at [www.mwa.govt.nz](http://www.mwa.govt.nz), contains research and case studies on actions and tools that organisations can use to increase the number of women in leadership roles.   

“Each of us needs to take action to ensure that all of New Zealand’s talent and skills are valued and engaged, says Mrs Goodhew.
