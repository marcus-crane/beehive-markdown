New Zealand will host a meeting of Australian Tourism Ministers early next year to explore areas where the two countries can drive greater innovation and productivity in the tourism sector, Associate Minister of Tourism Todd McClay has said.

Mr McClay, who recently attended the Tourism Ministers Meeting in Australia, said that the meeting had not previously been held in New Zealand and he therefore decided to extend an invitation to his Australian counterparts to hold it here next year.

“The Tourism Ministers Meeting is an opportunity for Australian and New Zealand Ministers to monitor progress on important tourism strategies, policy and to exchange views on international tourism trends that affect both countries,” Mr McClay says.

“The fact is also that many northern hemisphere travellers visit both Australia and New Zealand during the same trip. It’s therefore important we work together to promote our unique countries internationally.”

“Discussions are based on win-win opportunities for both countries; for instance, making it easy for international visitors to travel to Australia and New Zealand for the Cricket World Cup in 2015.”

“Tourism is a major contributor to the economies of both countries and given our location we inevitably share many international and domestic visitors, which is why the close relationship we have with Australia is so important.”

In the year to March over 1.2 million Australians visited New Zealand and spent over $2.1 billion. During this same period over 1.1 million New Zealand visited Australia, spending AU$2.3 billion.

“Hosting the meeting will give us a further opportunity to promote New Zealand’s fantastic tourism offerings to our largest and most important market,” Mr McClay says.

The Tourism Ministers Meeting is chaired by Australian Minister for Trade and Investment Hon Andrew Robb. It comprises ministers from the eight Australian states and territories as well as New Zealand.

A date and venue for the meeting will be announced in the near future.
