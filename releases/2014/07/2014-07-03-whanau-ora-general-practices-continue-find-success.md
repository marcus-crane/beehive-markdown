Associate Minister of Health and Minister for Whānau Ora Tariana Turia says that latest figures show general practices in Whānau Ora collectives are making continued progress in improving the health of high needs populations.

The recent paper, *Report on the Performance of General Practices in Whānau Ora Collectives as at* *March 2014,* compares the results of a sample of 37 general practices, which are part of Whānau Ora collectives, against a national sample of 100 general practices.

The report uses eleven indicators to compare performance March 2014 with the same time the year before. The results from the Whānau Ora sample were similar to or better than the national sample in seven of the eleven indicators.

“I am pleased but not surprized that the findings indicate that the general practices within Whānau Ora collectives are continuing to lead the field for several of our most significant health issues. The biggest improvements have been in providing ‘Smoking cessation advice’ (up 20.7%), ‘Cardiovascular risk recorded’ (up 17.1%) and ‘Diabetes patient review’ (up 8.5%),” says Minister Turia.

“These results are particularly encouraging considering that practices in the Whānau Ora sample deal with more than twice the number of high needs patients. While only 25.5% of enrolled patients in the national sample are high needs patients, this figure rises to 59.7% for those in the Whānau Ora sample.”

“These results are a reflection of the collaborative approach of Whānau Ora where Whānau Ora navigators, health providers, GP’s and government agencies work together to support families to determine their priorities and goals and make changes that will ensure a better healthier future,” says Mrs Turia.
