Finance Minister Bill English will attend the B20 forum in Sydney this week, where around 300 business leaders from around the world will finalise private sector policy recommendations for the G20 leaders’ summit later this year.

Australia, as host of the G20 this year, has invited New Zealand to attend as a guest alongside the G20 members.

“New Zealand strongly supports Australia’s approach to the G20 presidency, including its focus on promoting strong economic growth and employment, and making the global economy more resilient to deal with future shocks,” Mr English says.

“Such significant opportunities do not come along often. We appreciate Australia providing this opportunity for New Zealand – both at a political and business level – to showcase our country at an important international forum.”

New Zealand’s delegation to the B20 will include more than a dozen business leaders.

The forum, which runs from tomorrow until Friday, will include a keynote address from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. It will also include sessions focused on driving growth and jobs and on maximising global investment.
