Associate Tourism Minister Todd McClay has congratulated Tourism New Zealand on winning the Pacific Asia Travel Association’s (PATA) marketing Grand Award for the *100% Middle-Earth, 100% Pure New Zealand* campaign.

“The hard-work and innovation of Tourism New Zealand’s marketing teams has been rewarded through winning this award, it is a great achievement that everyone at Tourism New Zealand should be very proud of,” Mr McClay says.

The PATA Gold Awards recognise tourism organisations that have made outstanding contributions to successfully promote the travel industry in the Asia Pacific region.

“The *100% Middle-Earth* campaign has been a key marketing campaign for Tourism New Zealand in our major offshore tourism markets.”

“Without-a-doubt direct promotion has been a significant reason why many visitors have chosen to come to New Zealand in recent times.”

The most recent International Visitor Survey showed 14 per cent of holiday arrivals were directly influenced by The Hobbit, illustrating the value of the *100% Middle-Earth* campaign.

The Government committed an additional $158 million into Tourism over four years as part of Budget 2013.

“This funding increase has provided a major boost to Tourism New Zealand’s international marketing and has allowed us to put more resources into both traditional and emerging markets.”

“Tourism New Zealand is often considered the gold standard when it comes to international tourism promotion and marketing. This award is another acknowledgement of that,” Mr McClay says.

The PATA award was announced in Bangkok today and will be presented in Cambodia on 19 September.
