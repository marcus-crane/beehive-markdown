Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has said New Zealand strongly supports the United Nations Security Council’s call for a ceasefire between the Israelis and Palestinians.

“New Zealand fully supports the United Nations Security Council’s call for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza,” Mr McCully says.

“We urge both sides to show restraint and immediately de-escalate the situation. Civilian deaths are unacceptable and further civilian casualties must be prevented.

“These latest incidents reinforce the urgent need for a two state solution to be reached as part of a permanent and sustainable peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians,” Mr McCully says. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise against all travel to Gaza and urges New Zealanders currently in Gaza to depart as soon as it is safe to do so. 

All New Zealanders travelling overseas are strongly encouraged to register their details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade via the safe travel website: [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz)
