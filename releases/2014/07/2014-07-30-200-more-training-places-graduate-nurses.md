Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced the government will fund up to 200 additional training places for nurse graduates next year.

Mr Ryall says the $2.8 million investment will bring the total number of places available on the Nurse Entry to Practice programme to 1300.

The Nurse Entry to Practice programme offers professional and educational support for graduate nurses in their first year of practice.

“160 of the extra training places will be at public hospitals and DHB funded community health services, while the other 40 training places will be at aged residential care facilities across the country,” says Mr Ryall.

“Nurses are at the frontline of care providing round-the-clock care and support to patients and their families.

“As our aging population grows and demand on health services increases, we need even more nurses working in our communities.

“Ensuring we have a well-qualified and sustainable nursing workforce to meet the future health needs is a priority for this National-led Government.

“Latest Ministry of Health information shows there are 3,200 more nurses and midwives employed by district health boards (DHBs) than when this National-led Government was elected.

“More than 21,500 nurses and midwives are now working in our public hospitals and DHB funded community health services,” says Mr Ryall.
