Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today announced changes to make payments easier for Child, Youth and Family caregivers.

“Currently CYF caregivers are reimbursed for day to day needs including medical prescriptions.  From next month they will receive regular lump sum payments to cover costs and won’t have to waste time applying for the money.

“We trust caregivers to provide a loving nurturing home and it is ludicrous that we then make them jump through hoops to access funds to support the children in their care. 

From 20 August 2014, caregivers will receive:

- A $20 fortnightly payment for small costs to cover things like a birthday present for a child’s friend, prescription costs or a cell phone top up.
- A $350 set-up payment to help with items to get ready for their first placement including furniture or bedding.

And from 1 October:

- More frequent clothing allowance payments which will be paid every four weeks rather than quarterly.
- A new reimbursement for some caregivers of $0.77 cents per km who travel over 40km per week to meet the specific needs of a child or young person.

“Child, Youth and Family caregivers do an amazing job in opening their hearts and homes to children who need them.  I’m very pleased that we have been able to act on feedback from caregivers and redesign the payment system to be more flexible and responsive to these fantastic people,” says Mrs Bennett.
