Foreign Minister Murray McCully will lead the New Zealand delegation to the 45th Pacific Islands Forum in Palau on behalf of Prime Minister John Key this week.

“The Forum is the foremost annual meeting of Pacific leaders and I am honoured to be representing the Prime Minister at this event,” Mr McCully says.

“The theme of this year’s Forum is the sustainable management and development of ocean resources. This is an area where New Zealand is particularly active and we already work closely with Pacific countries on important regional issues like fisheries management.

“Leaders will also consider wider development, and political issues, including Fiji’s progress towards holding free and fair elections.

“In September Samoa will host the UN Small Islands Developing States conference. The Forum in Palau provides an opportunity for leaders to come together and agree to common positions ahead of this meeting.

“As a Pacific nation New Zealand is committed to working with our closest neighbours to build a more secure and prosperous region,” Mr McCully says.

The New Zealand delegation will travel by RNZAF 757 to Palau. A number of leaders from Pacific countries will also join the flights.
