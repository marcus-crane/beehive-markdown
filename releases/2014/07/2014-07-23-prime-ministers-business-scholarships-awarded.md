Thirteen senior executives and business owners have been given the opportunity to attend the world’s most prestigious business schools after receiving Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce was particularly pleased with the calibre of this year’s applicants and the range of businesses which applied.

“The successful applicants will gain invaluable knowledge from their studies which will benefit the companies they return to and help make them more competitive internationally,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand needs more business leaders with a global view. These scholarships will allow our smartest executives to learn best international practices and develop networks, which in turn will benefit New Zealand businesses as a whole.”

This is the fifth year the scholarships have been awarded.  This year, recipients will study at a range of top international institutions such as Harvard Business School, INSEAD (The Business School for the World) and the London Business School. 

The study programmes range from four weeks to twenty months and recipients receive on average $47,000 to cover half the cost of their course and expenses.
