Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has congratulated the winners of this year’s Diversity Awards.

The winners of the 17th annual ANZ and Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) Trust Diversity Awards were announced in Auckland last night.

“The Diversity Awards provides an opportunity for businesses across New Zealand to showcase their successful workplace diversity initiatives,” says Mrs Goodhew.

This year’s Supreme Award winner, Jacobs employs approximately 70,000 employees across a range of technical sectors.

A strong focus by Jacobs on gender diversity in earlier years has developed into a broader focus on inclusion. Through this mind-set, the business is actively addressing the unconscious bias which can create career limiting barriers.

“I congratulate Jacobs for tackling such a complex issue, and demonstrating practical ways to overcome bias for other businesses,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“More diversity and gender balance allows organisations to provide opportunities for men and women of all backgrounds and abilities. It can also lead to more diverse leadership, improved performance and stronger connections with customers.”

Further details about the awards can be found on the EEO Trust website, [www.eeotrust.org.nz](http://www.eeotrust.org.nz).
