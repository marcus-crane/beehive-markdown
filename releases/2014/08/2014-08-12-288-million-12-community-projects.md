Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced that 12 projects have been selected for this year’s Community Development Scheme.

“The scheme helps fund projects where communities have identified and found solutions to their own local issues,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The selected community receives $80,000 a year, for three years. A significant amount of this funding goes to employ a dedicated community development worker. The remaining funding assists with operational costs and the funding of projects to achieve the community outcomes.

“Volunteers are the backbone of the community, but sometimes a paid staff member is needed to ensure projects have the continuity and direction needed to succeed,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This year there has been a strong focus on youth projects, with young people the focus of eight out of the 12 projects.

“For example, the Te Hiku Youth Initiative in Kaitaia aims to develop an integrated youth service to support rurally isolated youth.”

The Community Development Scheme is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), with funding decisions made by an independent panel.

“I encourage groups looking to apply for next year’s funding round to work with one of DIAs 77 regional Community Advisors early in the development of their application to ensure their project meets the relevant criteria,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Applications for next year’s funding round open in November. Further information can be found here [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
