Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today announced more than $500,000 in funding for Waikato area conservation groups.

Tui 2000, QEII National Trust, Pirongia Te Aroaro o Kahu Restoration Society, Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust and the National Wetland Trust have all received grants from the Community Conservation Partnership Fund.

“The funding announced today will further projects ranging from weed and predator control, to planting and kokako translocations.  They align with the Department of Conservation’s goal of connecting more urban dwellers to conservation and working in partnership with others,” Ms Wagner says.

- Tui 2000 will receive $105,000 over three years for restoration planting at Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park, which comprises 60 hectares of land surrounding a peat lake, within Hamilton City’s boundary.
- QEII National Trust will receive $34,500 for the Waikato Tradescantia Biological Control Project.  It will look to tackle the rampant and destructive weed, *tradescantia* (known as Wandering Willy) on six covenants, which are either wetland or riparian forests.
- The Pirongia Te Aroaro o Kahu Restoration Society will receive $17,250 for the preparation of a plan to translocate kokako to Mt Pirongia, where kokako used to live, to an area which is receiving intensive pest control.
- Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust will receive $300,000 over two years to sustain the current work programme at Maungatautari, a mountain near Te Awamutu, and to implement new programmes at what is the largest community run mainland ecological island in New Zealand.
- The National Wetland Trust will receive $59,000 over three years to continue predator control at Rotopiko and to fund a project manager to establish a community care group.

“I’m very impressed with the commitment and passion shown by all of these groups, which have dedicated time and money to ensure our special places and creatures are around for all New Zealanders to enjoy.

“I’ll watch with interest as these great conservation projects progress,” Ms Wagner says.

The Community Conservation Partnership Fund provides $26 million over four years to community organisations for natural heritage and recreation projects.
