New Zealand’s science and research collaboration with the United States has been further strengthened following joint talks in Auckland yesterday and today by senior New Zealand and US officials and researchers, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce says.

Mr Joyce led the New Zealand delegation at the 4th meeting of the New Zealand/United States Joint Commission on Science and Technology Cooperation. The US delegation was led by Jonathan Margolis, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Science, Space and Health in the US Department of State.

"The United States is a world leader in science, innovation and technology. It is New Zealand’s most significant research and technology partner. The joint commission meeting in Auckland has provided an excellent opportunity to further assess where both countries should focus their collaborative efforts.” Mr Joyce says.

The Commission meets every two years. This  meeting focused on strengthening collaboration in the areas of health, marine and oceans, climate change, natural hazards and invasive species research. It also reviewed progress since the last meeting of the Commission in Washington DC in 2012.

“This year’s meeting and reception involved about 70 representatives across leading New Zealand and US research organisations and departments. I was impressed with the level of engagement, substantive discussion and goodwill between both sides,” Mr Joyce says.

The Commission meeting concluded with agreement on a two year action plan based on the outcomes of workshops held in each area of research focus. The plan will be reviewed when the Commission next meets in Washington DC in 2016.

The New Zealand/United States Joint Commission meeting is one a series of international science meetings being held in New Zealand during World Science Week this week.
