Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the latest update on progress in the New Zealand International Convention Centre project.

SkyCity issued a company market update this morning that included information about and images from the draft Concept Design for the new international-standard convention centre, to be based in Auckland. It also provided information on a new five-star hotel and a laneway which Sky City will build as part of the International Convention Centre precinct.

“It’s good to see the project reach the draft Concept Design milestone in what has been a constructive and collaborative process,” Mr Joyce says. “It’s also positive to see that SkyCity is making additional investment beyond what they have committed to in the Convention Centre Agreement.

“SkyCity and the Crown will now work on finalising the next stage of design for the last quarter of 2014. I look forward to seeing SkyCity lodge its resource consent application for the centre later this year.

“The New Zealand International Convention Centre will generate major benefits to Auckland and New Zealand once it is up and running, through more jobs, economic growth and a boost to our tourism sector. The spin-offs include an estimated 1000 jobs during construction, and, once it is up and running, an estimated $90 million injection into the economy each year, 800 jobs and a $49 million boost to GDP.”

The Convention Centre will:

- Comfortably accommodate conferences of up to 3500 people
- Host up to three simultaneous exhibitions in the 8692sqm exhibition hall
- Seat up to 3000 people in the plenary hall
- Host at least two events at the same time, of up to 1250 people per event.

“The International Convention Centre will ensure New Zealand is able to compete effectively with Australia and Asia in the business convention market and tap into the growing numbers of high-value business visitors,” Mr Joyce says.

“It’s estimated the centre could attract an additional 33,000 convention delegates to Auckland each year. This will give us significant opportunities to promote and connect New Zealand’s innovative businesses to international networks and international market opportunities.”
