Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne has announced a review of the passport validity period including an independent review of passport security and a review of passport costs with a view to returning to 10-year passports.

These reviews are part of the Government’s response to the Government Administration Committee’s report on the petition to reintroduce a 10-year passport validity. The Select Committee recommended that the Government should review passport validity because the Committee couldn’t reach a conclusion about retaining a five-year validity period or moving to 10 years.

“The Government agrees with the Committee’s view that moving to biometric passports has increased their security. While attempts to counterfeit and/or falsify passports, including biometric passports continue, advances in technology are continuing to diminish that risk. It is therefore timely to investigate whether security features in the passport need to be refreshed every five years as opposed to a 10-year interval,” says Mr Dunne

“A secure passport and passport system is necessary to keep the identity information about passport holders safe and secure and I want an assurance that any security issues raised by moving to a longer validity period are properly addressed. I have also asked the Department of Internal Affairs to review passport costs. Our world-class and highly secure passport system is funded purely on a cost recovery basis meaning that only those who need passports pay for the service.”

Moving to a 10-year passport could lead to higher upfront passport fees as revenue would decline from processing passports on a less frequent basis.

“I have consistently said I have an open mind on the length of passport validity. When the independent and Departmental reviews are complete in December, any changes that are recommended will be presented to Cabinet”, says Mr Dunne.
