Novice drivers and motorcycle riders will be encouraged to progress to the next licence stage within five years, with the introduction of a time limit on new learner and restricted licences, says Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse.

Under changes to the *Land Transport (Driver Licensing) Rule,* drivers or riders who don’t move on to the next stage of the Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS) within five years will need to pass another theory test to renew an expired learner or restricted licence.

“The GDLS is structured so novice drivers and riders progress from a learner licence to a restricted licence and on to a full licence within a reasonable period. It was never intended that drivers and riders stay at the learner or restricted stage indefinitely,” Mr Woodhouse says. 

“This change will encourage drivers and riders move through the licence system in a timely way, while gaining the skills and experience needed to drive safely.”

According to recent figures, approximately 40 percent of learner licence holders had held their licences for more than 6 years. For restricted licence holders, this figure rises to forty-five per cent.

“This move is part of the government’s strategy to continue to improve the safety of young motorists, and drive the road toll down,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The ten year licence period remains unchanged for those on full licences. Holders of a full licence will be unaffected by the rule change.

The Rule will come into force on 1 December 2014.
