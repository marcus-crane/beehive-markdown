Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today unveiled a new public sculpture in central Christchurch symbolic of nature and renewal.

Woods from the Trees, by Canterbury artist Regan Gentry, uses timber reclaimed from a demolished Christchurch home to create three towering rimu trees on the corner of High and Tuam streets.

“The Department of Conservation is supporting this project because the artist’s vision of creating an urban forest aligns with its goal to bring nature into the city and connect more urban dwellers to conservation.

“It is one of several urban projects DOC is involved with in partnership with others, to trial new ways of engaging with communities,” Ms Wagner says.

Other projects include the family-focussed Nature Play Park/Papatākaroa Ao Turoa on Latimer Square created last year with Greening the Rubble Trust, and the Imagine app launched in May.

A transitional DOC visitor centre on High Street with an adjoining Nature Oasis is planned to open later this year.

Woods from the Trees was commissioned by Christchurch business woman Jo Blair, and has been supported by numerous businesses and Christchurch City Council.  A significant contribution came from crowd-funding, with a portion of this going to the Kea Conservation Trust.

“I encourage Christchurch residents to enjoy this sculpture and the increasing number of conservation activities on offer in the city,” Ms Wagner says.
