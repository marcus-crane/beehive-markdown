Land Information Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced the reappointment of Phillip Curnow and Ken Taylor to the Valuers Registration Board (VRB) for a further three-year term.

The VRB is an independent statutory body – administered by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) – that oversees the registration of valuers and investigates complaints.

“Both Mr Curnow and Mr Taylor were first appointed to the VRB in 2007 and reappointed in 2011,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Based in Hamilton, Mr Curnow brings urban commercial and industrial property expertise to the VRB – as well as expertise and knowledge of local body, compensation, and ground lease valuations and advice.

“Mr Taylor is a senior valuer who brings rural experience to the VRB.  Based in Alexandra, he provides geographic representation to the VRB as well as expertise in and knowledge of South Island rural valuation practices.

“Mr Curnow and Mr Taylor are highly experienced valuers with a wealth of expertise.  I am pleased that they will continue to serve on the VRB and help maintain New Zealanders’ confidence in registered valuers,” Mr Woodhouse says.
