Foreign Minister Murray McCully has appointed diplomat Reuben Levermore as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Thailand.

“New Zealand has a close relationship with Thailand and it was our tenth largest trading partner in 2013,” Mr McCully says.

“Despite ongoing political turbulence, Thailand remains an important political and economic partner for New Zealand in the Southeast Asian region.

“The relationship is built on a range of areas of mutual interest, including tourism and education.

“There are around 3,000 Thai students currently studying in New Zealand, and Thailand has long been a favoured destination for New Zealand tourists,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Levermore is currently New Zealand’s Ambassador to the Philippines.
