The latest employment statistics show that Pacific people are benefiting from a strengthening economy with the number of Pacific people now employed at 111,400, compared with 93,400 in June 2013.

Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says as Pacific unemployment decreases, it means thousands more Pacific people are in jobs earning a living, and able to support themselves, their families and their communities.

The Household Labour Force Survey for the June 2014 quarter shows Pacific unemployment is down 1.6 percentage points, from 13 per cent in March 2014  to 11.4 per cent in June 2014.  That’s 5,500 more people in jobs. The total year showed a drop of 4.9 per cent with 18,000 more people in jobs from June 2013.

“To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of an extra AMI Stadium in Christchurch full of Pacific people going to work every day.  It is also the largest annual movement in employment seen since the series began in December 2007,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“This is encouraging news for our Pacific people as we continue to recover from the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes.  It is also positive for families and communities as we see more of our people realising the value that comes with paid employment.

“It shows our economy is growing and moving in the right direction under the practical and aspirational leadership of John Key and Bill English. More importantly it also shows our Pacific people are prospering and realising the gains of that economic growth,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

He adds that positive new employment data coupled with last month’s statistics showing greater educational achievement prove that Pacific people are making great progress under the National Government.

“I want more of our Pacific people to be better qualified and in sustainable, higher paying jobs. Our National Government is advancing both of these important issues and Pacific people, families and communities are reaping the benefits.”
