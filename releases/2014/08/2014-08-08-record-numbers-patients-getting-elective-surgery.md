Latest Ministry of Health data shows over 162,000 hips, knees and other elective operations were performed last financial year – 44,000 more operations than six years ago.

Mr Ryall says this significant increase means every day 170 more patients are getting the operations they need and they’re getting them faster compared to 2008.

“Elective surgery makes a real difference to patients and their families – it reduces pain, restores independence and improves quality of life.

“The number of patients receiving hips, knees and other elective surgery has lifted from 118,000 in 2008 to 162,000 this year – an unprecedented 37 per cent increase,” says Mr Ryall.

Over the past six years:

- orthopaedic operations have increased significantly by 30 per cent,
- the number of vascular surgeries have more than doubled, and
- 21,000 extra people over the age of 65 are receiving operations annually.

“Improving access to hips, knees and other elective surgery is a priority for this National-led Government – it’s one of our six national health targets and every year we invest in providing more care for more patients sooner.

“We want even more New Zealanders to benefit from elective surgery and are committed to continuing our record increases,” says Mr Ryall.
