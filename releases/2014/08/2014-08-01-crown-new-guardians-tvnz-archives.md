Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss has welcomed the transfer of TVNZ’s archives to Crown guardianship today.

The archives, which include over 500,000 hours of original New Zealand television, will be managed on a day-to-day basis by Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision – the rebranded New Zealand Film Archives.

An event celebrating the transfer and rebranding was held in Wellington yesterday. 

“In February last year we celebrated the transfer of the Sound Archives.  Today we complete the picture, bringing the TVNZ Archives into the fold,” Mr Foss says.

“Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision is a fitting name for the organisation responsible for our precious film, television and radio heritage.

“Until now public access to the TVNZ Archives has been very limited.  Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision will begin to digitise the items of highest heritage value and make them available online to all New Zealanders free of charge. 

“The first clips are expected to be online before the end of the year, with about 20,000 titles made available over the next three years.

“The Government has invested $24.4 million in the purchase, improvement and ongoing operation of the archive. Its transfer reflects our commitment to better public services and value for money.”
