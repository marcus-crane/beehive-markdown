Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed the July building consent figures from Statistics New Zealand that show the number of new dwelling consents is growing at record rates.

“These building consent figures show the Housing Accord in Auckland is delivering record residential building growth and that the Christchurch residential rebuild is progressing at pace,” Dr Smith says.

Building consents for the year to the end of July were 23,659 nationally, 7119 in Auckland and 3776 in Christchurch, representing growth of 23 per cent, 30 per cent and 109 per cent, respectively.

“The annual rate of growth in Auckland of 30 per cent is the highest in a decade, reflecting the efforts by Government and Council to free up land supply and fast-track consents.

“These figures prove the Government’s housing reforms are working. We are increasing land supply and speeding up consent process through our Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas legislation. In Auckland alone, we have so far announced 63 Special Housing Areas, with a potential yield of 33,500 homes. I expect to make an announcement on the fourth tranche of Special Housing Areas in coming weeks.

“We are also reducing building material costs, reining in development contributions, cutting compliance costs, investing in skills and productivity in the construction sector, and providing support for first home buyers.

“It is the combination of these measures that will make a lasting difference to improving housing supply and affordability for New Zealanders,” Dr Smith concluded.
