Commerce Minister Craig Foss today welcomed the launch of The Exchange website – a platform to support and deliver financial literacy programmes.

“The Exchange website allows community organisations, banks and others in the finance sector to work together to help Kiwis make better financial decisions,” Mr Foss says.

“By working together we will see more innovative and practical ideas reach the people who need it the most.

“I encourage community organisations to list their projects on the site and banks and the finance sector to get behind them.” 

The website is an initiative by the financial literacy consortium The Exchange, which aims to harness the collective power of government and the finance sector to tackle financial literacy issues in New Zealand.

“This is just one of a number of Government initiatives to protect financially vulnerable New Zealanders. Recent changes to consumer credit legislation will protect borrowers from predatory lenders, and the new Community Finance scheme will provide low interest loans to help low income families and individuals avoid high-cost credit and spiralling debt.”

The Exchange is coordinated by the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income, and has the Governor-General, Sir Jerry Mateparae, as its patron.
