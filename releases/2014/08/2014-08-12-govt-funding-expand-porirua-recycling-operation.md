Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced funding of $150,000 to support the expansion of a community-based recycling operation in Porirua.

The money was awarded to Mana Recovery Trust from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund.

Mana Recovery Trust will significantly expand its current operations through the construction of a purpose-built facility to sort and recycle packaging waste from businesses across the lower North Island.

Waste materials targeted by the scheme include paper, plastic, cardboard and glass.

“Mana Recovery Trust estimates that more than 840 tonnes of waste will be diverted from landfill in the first year of its new operation, as it lifts recycling rates for local businesses. The Trust will also support its goals by running recycling training seminars for businesses,” Ms Adams says.

“Recovering materials and getting economic value from waste can also provide social benefits, so I am encouraged that the Mana Recovery Trust aims to create jobs for a number of people in the local community.

“This project also has the potential to be used as a template for organisations undertaking similar operations.”

The $150,000 for the project comes from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund.

The Fund provides financial support to projects which increase resource efficiency and decrease the amount of waste going to landfill.

To date the Government has awarded more than $50 million to 100 projects through the Fund.
