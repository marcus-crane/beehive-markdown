The arrival of around 2000 top international scientists and researchers in Auckland later this month will make New Zealand the focus of the world science community, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce says.

The scientists are in New Zealand for a series of meetings to be held under the umbrella of World Science Week New Zealand.  The week brings together a range of major international science summits alongside a series of public science lectures.    

“Many of the international meetings are being held in New Zealand for the first time, and all are critical to setting the future global science and research agenda,” Mr Joyce says. “The presence of so many eminent scientists and science leaders from around the world presents an unparalleled opportunity for New Zealand scientists to increase their international networks.  It also confirms New Zealand as an active and engaged member of the international science community.”

The international meetings include:

- The 31st triennial General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  ICSU is based in Paris and represents more than 150 science academies and scientific organisations in 141 countries.
- The 6th biennial Open Science Conference of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) is expected to attract more than 1000 scientists involved in research on the southern continent.
- The 4th biennial United States-New Zealand Joint Committee Meeting on Science and Technology Cooperation (JCM).  The themes of the meeting include natural hazards and resilience, climate change and ocean.
- The annual general meeting of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP), organisations that deliver and support scientific research in Antarctica.
- The Science and Diplomacy Symposium will focus on how scientists can provide input into foreign affairs, diplomacy, trade and foreign aid.
- The inaugural Science Advice to Governments conference will involve the world’s most eminent science advisors and will focus on the provision of policy-relevant science advice to governments.
- The 2nd APEC Chief Science Advisors and equivalents meeting which will provide a forum for discussion on the interface between science and policy.

The public will have the opportunity to hear some of the visiting scientists speak at a series of free science lectures.

At the public events some of the world’s foremost experts will share their views and insights on critical science issues, including the impact melting ice caps might have on sea level rise, future food security, and the impact of pandemics as the planet undergoes climate change.  Another session will focus on the considerable contribution New Zealand has made to international scientific knowledge.

World Science Week runs from 24 August to 3 September.  Details of the events are available at: [www.worldscienceweek.org.nz](http://www.worldscienceweek.org.nz)
