The Crown has signed a deed of settlement with Ngaruahine settling the iwi’s historical Treaty claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The signing ceremony took place at Te Ngutu o Te Manu in Taranaki. The Crown was represented by Mr Finlayson, Minister for Whanau Ora and Member of Parliament for Te Tai Hauāuru Tariana Turia, and Minister for Courts and Member of Parliament for Whanganui Chester Borrows. The signing was witnessed by Member of Parliament for New Plymouth Jonathan Young, and Claudette Hauiti MP.

The settlement provides acknowledgements, an apology and redress for the Crown’s actions and omissions, including confiscation and extensive Crown purchases in the three decades following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

"Ngāruahine has waited a long time to reach this day,” Mr Finlayson said. "No settlement can fully compensate for the wrongs of the past, but this settlement will enable the people of Ngāruahine to move forward focus on developing a strong cultural and economic future in the region.”

“The signing is the first deed signing in Taranaki for many years and means that five of the eight iwi of Taranaki will have signed deeds of settlement.”

The settlement package includes a quantum of $67.5 million, a right of deferred selection over 12 sites and the purchase of two South Taranaki District Council sites.

It also includes four culturally significant sites. These are Waipakari Reserve, Te Kohinga Reserve, Te Ngutu o te Manu and Te Poho o Taranaki.

All existing public access rights in relation to areas affected by this settlement will be preserved.

“The government is deeply committed to resolving historical Treaty grievances for all New Zealanders in a just and timely manner,” Mr Finlayson said.

The settlement will be given effect through legislation.
