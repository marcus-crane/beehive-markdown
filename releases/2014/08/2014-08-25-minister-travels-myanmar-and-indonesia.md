Minister Tim Groser travels to Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, this week to participate in a series of annual regional trade meetings.  He will also attend the Sixth Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations in Bali, Indonesia.

In Nay Pyi Taw, Mr Groser will attend the East Asia Summit (EAS) Economic Ministers Meeting and the annual ASEAN - Australia/New Zealand Economic Ministers consultation,  which will focus on the implementation of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA).  He will also attend the second Ministerial Meeting for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) FTA negotiations.

“The EAS is the only leaders-led regional process that includes all of the region’s major players. Through these meetings, New Zealand is able to engage with our key partners in the Asia-Pacific with a view towards strengthening trade and economic ties and deepening regional economic integration”, Mr Groser says.

“The meetings also provide an important opportunity to take stock of progress on the RCEP negotiations.

“RCEP has the potential to be a game changer for regional trade. It is important that all 16 countries continue to work together to realise the vision of a modern, comprehensive and high-quality agreement.”

Ministers will also sign the First Protocol to Amend AANZFTA, which will make AANZFTA more transparent and friendly for business.

“New Zealand is committed to working with Australia and ASEAN in fully implementing our AANZFTA commitments and to maximise business up-take of the real opportunities that that agreement offers.”

Mr Groser will also attend the Sixth Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations in Bali, Indonesia.

“The Alliance of Civilisations is a leading global initiative for intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation. New Zealand values this Forum as it supports New Zealand’s comprehensive, multifaceted and long-term approach to countering extremism and combating terrorism.”
