Associate Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today announced a further step in the Government’s drive to reduce the cost of building new homes with the appointment of 26 commissioners to the Register of Development Contributions Commissioners.

“These commissioners will serve as a panel to ensure transparency and accountability in the charging of development contributions,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“We are committed to making sure development contributions do not unnecessarily impact housing affordability.”

The appointments follow the passing of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act (No 3) 2014.

“The Act which comes into force today includes improvements to the development contributions regime, making them fairer and more transparent. This is part of a suite of housing affordability initiatives like increasing land supply, establishing Special Housing Areas, removing tariffs on building materials and reforming the Resource Management Act 1991,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

He adds that the development contributions commissioners will make sure that councils can only charge developers for infrastructure related directly to their developments.  He says the commissioners will manage the new objections process as the law now allows developers to object to a council’s imposition of a development contribution charge.

“I am pleased with the calibre of people who put their names forward for the register. I am confident that the appointed commissioners possess the relevant knowledge, skills and expertise to serve on the panel.”

All the commissioners are appointed for a three-year term.
