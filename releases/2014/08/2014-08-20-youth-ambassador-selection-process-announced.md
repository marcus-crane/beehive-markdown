Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse has announced plans to select 25 Youth Ambassadors to attend 2015 Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli.

“The 1915 Gallipoli campaign holds an important place in New Zealand’s history. Gallipoli 2015 is central to New Zealand’s First World War centenary programme,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Our Youth Ambassadors will be important in carrying the traditions of Anzac Day commemorations forward. They will be encouraged to tell the Gallipoli story in their own voices, from their unique perspectives.

“They will also have a practical role on the Gallipoli Peninsula assisting other New Zealanders – particularly older New Zealanders – attending the commemorations.”

Youth Ambassadors will be selected from current competitions such as the *Minister of Veterans’ Affairs Passchendaele competition* and the *ANZ RSA Cyril Bassett VC speech competition*, as well as a new Gallipoli 2015 social media competition administered by the Ministry of Youth Development.

Other Youth Ambassadors will be selected from the New Zealand Cadet Forces, Limited Service Volunteers, and from the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme.

Youth Ambassadors will be part of the New Zealand Defence Force contingent and will have their travel, accommodation and meal arrangements paid for.
