Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today announced the Kauri 2000 Trust has received $57,000 to help prevent the spread of Kauri Dieback disease on the Coromandel Peninsula.

The grant is from the Department of Conservation’s Community Conservation Partnership Fund.

“The Trust is spearheading efforts to establish and maintain a community based action network to help prevent the spread of kauri dieback by raising levels of awareness, and encouraging practical changes in behaviour to reduce the risk to Kauri in the Coromandel.

“This project involves working closely with the national Kauri Dieback Management Programme and will also bring together the resources and knowledge of key local interest groups,” Ms Wagner says.

The Kauri 2000 Trust has planted 40,000 kauri trees since 2000.  This milestone was marked today alongside the funding announcement.

“Without the Trust and its approach to reducing the impact of Kauri Dieback on the Coromandel Peninsula, we could well see more giants of the forest succumb to this disease,” Nicky Wagner says.
