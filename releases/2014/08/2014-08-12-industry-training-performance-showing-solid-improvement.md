Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the release of the 2013 educational performance data for Industry Training Organisations (ITOs), which show solid improvements in the performance of their trainees and apprentices.

“The big consolidation of the ITO sector from 39 down to 13 ITOs has resulted in larger organisations delivering better services for trainees and employers,” Mr Joyce says.

“Trainees are achieving more credits towards their programmes of study, and more trainees are completing their programmes of study.”

Data released today by the Tertiary Education Commission today shows how individual ITOs are performing by measuring them against two performance measures: achievement of credits and completion of programmes.

“It is pleasing to see both of these performance indicators improve across the ITO sector from 2012 to 2013. The majority of ITOs improved their programme completion rates, in some cases by more than 20 percentage points.” Mr Joyce says.

Sector-wide results for 2013 include:

- The credit achievement rate across the ITO sector was almost 72 per cent, an increase of 2 per cent since 2012.
- The programme completion rate across the ITO sector was 74 per cent, an increase of almost 9 per cent since 2012.

“We expect ITOs to continue to achieve better results as the sector completes its consolidation and our wider industry training reforms bed in,” Mr Joyce says.

“Other changes, like the introduction of New Zealand Apprenticeships, the Apprenticeship Reboot, and the new vocational pathways, means we are well set up to meet the industry training needs of an expanding economy in the years ahead.”

ITOs are central to workplace learning for trainees in employment. They set national skill standards and provide leadership on skill and training needs for their industry. ITOs develop training plans, assess trainees, and monitor training quality.
