Education Minister Hekia Parata says important progress has been made on the $359 million initiative to improve student achievement with several secondary schooling sector groups reaching agreements with the Ministry of Education.

The Ministry has reached agreements with the organisations that represent the principals of the 339 secondary schools in New Zealand, and the NZ School Trustees Association which represents those Boards of Trustees and parents, on how the new principal roles will work as part of *Investing in Educational Success*.

They have signed memorandums of understanding with the Ministry, which will allow the secondary principals collective agreement to be altered.

“This is a really positive outcome and great news for kids, parents and schools as we move on with the next steps so this can be put in place from next year.

Negotiations are still ongoing with the PPTA on the teaching roles associated with secondary schools.

”The Government is committed to every child getting  the best education possible and we’re confident we can achieve this by keeping the best teachers in the classroom, by encouraging collaboration between schools and by strengthening school leadership,” Ms Parata says.

“The Government will continue to work with the sector unions and other key groups to develop this initiative.”

“We remain committed to implementing this initiative with all those groups keen to be involved.”
