Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne is delighted the digital identity service RealMe last night won an international internet award saying it shows how highly the government service is rated.

“The win for RealMe in the Security & Online Safety category at the Australia and New Zealand Internet Awards held in Melbourne underscores the integrity of the RealMe service and the trust and confidence New Zealanders can place in the service.

“The Department of Internal Affairs and New Zealand Post built RealMe to create trust and confidence for the user and the organisations offering online services that require proof of identity. Government agencies are working together to make it easy for customers to access services digitally using RealMe and I’m delighted to see RealMe recognised within this category”, says Mr Dunne.

RealMe provides an easy way for people to securely prove their identity online, a secure, consent based process for people to access and share personal information digitally. It is a core component of the Government’s drive to deliver better, faster digital services.

Large trading banks and the financial services sector have been early adopters of the RealMe service as well as government agencies such as the Electoral Commission, who use RealMe verified account for people who want to complete the voter enrolment process online.

“The RealMe service puts the customer at the centre and allows them to share their information securely when they choose to do so. RealMe is the digital equivalent of a passport. The information customers share from one organization to another is not stored by the RealMe service. RealMe only holds the information needed to manage a customer account. So New Zealanders can have complete confidence that their privacy is protected”, says Mr Dunne.
