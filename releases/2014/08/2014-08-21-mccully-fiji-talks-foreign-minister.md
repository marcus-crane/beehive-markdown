Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Nadi tomorrow to meet with Fiji’s Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola.

“My meeting with Minister Kabuabola will focus on foreign policy discussions, regional issues, and Fiji’s ongoing preparations for elections on 17 September,” Mr McCully says.

“It is an opportunity to get Fiji’s perspective on the work that is going into preparing for the ballot, and whether there are further areas where New Zealand can assist.

“To date we have provided technical assistance for the elections process, totalling $1.55 million, and contributed $1.5 million towards a project aimed at re-establishing and strengthening Fiji’s Parliament,” Mr McCully says.

This is Minister McCully’s second visit to Fiji since the lifting of New Zealand’s remaining travel sanctions in March.
