Building and Construction Minister Dr Nick Smith has welcomed the Assessment Report from International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) today which shows the Christchurch City Council is making good progress towards regaining its accreditation as a Building Consent Authority (BCA).

“These improvements in the Council’s building consenting processes have occurred at a time of phenomenal growth. Christchurch would typically issue 166 consents per month. In the last year the rate has more than doubled and the latest figures show a record 382 was issued in June 2014,” Dr Smith says.

“I am pleased at the progress that has been made. The Council has been able to apply for assessment as a BCA in less than a year. Today’s report from IANZ has found some corrective actions and recommendations that the Council needs to clear before it can be granted accreditation again. This is not unusual and the Council was already in the process of addressing most of the issues that were raised.

“The post-earthquake environment requires that these consents are processed quickly to support the recovery but it is just as important that it is a quality rebuild.”

IANZ revoked the Council’s building consent accreditation in July last year after its building consenting processes failed to meet the required standard, and as a result a Crown Manager was appointed and a comprehensive action plan put in place.

“The action plan has seen the Council’s building control department restructured, demand forecasting improved, new technology adopted and better systems put in place. Staff numbers have been boosted to ensure there is adequate resourcing. The Council has made a real effort and has come a long way in a short period of time,” Dr Smith says.

“Christchurch is leading the country in terms of new house build rates with building consent figures reaching record highs month after month, and everything possible needs to be done to support this momentum. I am encouraged by today’s report and by the assurances I have received from the Council that its focus is now on working to clear the corrective actions so that it can meet its goal of regaining accreditation by the end of this year.”
