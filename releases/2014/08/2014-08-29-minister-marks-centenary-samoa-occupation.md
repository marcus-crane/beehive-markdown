Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Lotu-Iiga today attended a national commemoration at the Cenotaph in the Auckland Domain to mark the centenary of New Zealand’s occupation of Samoa.

The request to seize the German colony of Samoa during the First World War was made by Britain as a ‘great and urgent Imperial service’.  It also marked the first military action by New Zealand in the Pacific, with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force Samoan Advance Party – 1,400 people including nurses, chaplains, mechanics, Post and Telegraph Corps and engineers – landing in Apia on 29 August 1914.

“The occupation started a relationship that has developed through the decades to one which we all enjoy today.  It is a relationship based on friendship and shared values with a common vision of the future.” Mr Lotu-Iiga said

“With nearly 145,000 Samoans now in New Zealand and Samoan being the 3rd most spoken language after English and Māori, the impact of Samoans in New Zealand has left an indelible mark on the identity and culture of New Zealand and will continue to do so.”

The ceremony was led by His Excellency Lieutenant General the Right Honourable Sir Jerry Mateparae, GNZM, QSO, Governor-General of New Zealand and His Excellency Leasi Papali’i Tommy Scanlan, High Commissioner for Samoa.

Short historical readings in front of the Cenotaph provided perspectives from the 1914 Samoan Advance Party and the Samoan experience of the First World War.

“It is a special privilege to see representatives of all those families that witnessed and participated in this event so many years ago.  I also want to acknowledge the descendants of the New Zealand soldiers that went to Samoa on behalf of the New Zealand government,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

The laying of wreaths was undertaken by representatives of New Zealand, Samoa, Britain and Germany. Following a reading by college students Leorida Peters and Ben Gatting, a prayer was offered in commemoration of the centenary of New Zealand’s occupation of German Samoa.

“Our Government looks forward to continuing to embrace and deepen our already strong relationship with Samoa for the benefit of our people, families and communities.”

A commemoration to mark the centenary of the landing of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in Samoa will also take place on 29 August at Magiagi Cemetery, Apia, followed by an official dinner. Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa and representatives from Samoa, New Zealand, Germany, Australia, France and Britain will lay wreaths.
