Health Minister Tony Ryall officially opened the $7 million Nikau House development at Elizabeth Knox Home and Hospital in Epsom, Auckland today.

“This new development will add 60 new bedrooms to the 140 residents already here at Knox Home,” says Mr Ryall.

“There are a number of new developments that were included after discussions with residents such as the two new wheelchair accessible kitchens and better access to the courtyard so residents can enjoy their independence.

“I’m sure that the living areas which serve clusters of 15 people will create a more communal atmosphere and increase the level of comfort and enjoyment for residents.

“The health system will face some big challenges as our population continues to age, with the number of people over 75 growing at an ever increasing rate,” says Mr Ryall.

“Residential care services have a big role to play in the future of aged care. Continued investment is crucial to ensure services remain sustainable and New Zealand’s older people receive the best possible care.

“The Government is currently rolling out interRAI, a comprehensive clinical assessment tool, in aged residential care which ensures that older people receive the same assessment regardless of where in New Zealand they live.

“Knox Home is doing particularly well in this area, with 11 nurses already trained in the use of this tool.

“This government supports our older people to remain active and independent, but also supports those who might need more intensive support services,” says Mr Ryall.

Since 2008 this National Government has increased the spending on support for the elderly to $1.5 billion.
