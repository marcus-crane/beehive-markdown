The roll out of the Flagship Programme to reduce crime and re-offending in Papakura, Hamilton and the East Coast is making excellent progress, Justice Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Ms Collins visited both the Papakura and Hamilton projects recently to see first-hand the progress being made and to meet the frontline staff involved.

“The key to the Flagship Programme is increased collaboration between Police, Justice, Corrections and other frontline providers tailored to the specific needs of communities and vulnerable families,” Ms Collins says.

“The Programme is bringing agencies together to identify local solutions to local problems, such as alcohol in Papakura, reintegration of youth offenders in Hamilton and family violence on the East Coast.”

The Flagship Programme began in the three regions in January following the successful trial of the Hutt Valley Innovation Project, which ran between September 2012 and December 2013 in the Hutt Valley.

“The Programme’s potential to reduce crime and reoffending has been proven in the Hutt Valley where crime has fallen 23 percent,” Ms Collins says. 

“I know further collaboration between Police, Justice, Corrections and other frontline service providers in Papakura, Hamilton and East Coast will make a positive difference to vulnerable families and young people in these communities.”

The Flagships have developed initiatives to respond to local issues, including joint case management, better service delivery, drivers licencing, youth violence, addressing local causes of crime and prisoner re-integration.

Ms Collins acknowledges the outstanding efforts of all Justice sector and support agency staff, particularly those on the frontline, as the Flagship Programme roll out continues.
