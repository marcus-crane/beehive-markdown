Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the dignitaries and leaders that will visit New Zealand on-route to the Small Island Developing States Conference in Samoa from 1-4 September.

“The United Nations Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Conference takes place once every ten years and Samoa hosting the event is an opportunity for the Pacific region to set the global agenda,” Mr McCully says.

“More than 100 states will be represented at the SIDS Conference and we are currently expecting about a dozen leaders or Ministers from Caribbean, Atlantic and Indian Ocean states to stay briefly in New Zealand as they travel to and from the conference in Apia.  These guests will take part in programmes designed to showcase New Zealand’s expertise in renewable energy, agriculture and fisheries.

A list of the all visiting dignitaries will be available on the [MFAT website](http://mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/Pacific/0-SIDS.php) as their travel is confirmed.

“We will also welcome the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who will visit New Zealand to receive an honorary degree from the University of Auckland.

“I would like to take this opportunity to welcome all our guests and wish them all the best for the UN SIDS conference, onwards travel, or programmes in New Zealand.

“The conference itself will have a strong focus on development issues including fisheries management and renewable energy. These are areas where New Zealand is active in the region and we look forward to sharing the Pacific’s recent successes with the wider UN membership,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully will represent New Zealand at the UN SIDS conference from 31 August till 3 September.
