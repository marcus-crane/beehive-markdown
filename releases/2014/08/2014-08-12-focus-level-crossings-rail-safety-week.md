Rail Safety Week is a reminder for all drivers, cyclists and pedestrians to stay alert around level crossings, says Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse at today’s Rail Safety Week launch.

“A near miss can also be seen as a near hit. It’s just not worth taking the risk around level crossings, which is why this year’s focus for Rail Safety Week is on level crossings,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“There are more than 1300 level crossings in New Zealand, and on average, there is a near miss every three days.”

As part of this year’s Rail Safety Week, KiwiRail and TrackSAFE NZ have developed an interactive train simulator, giving people the experience of being a train driver.

“There is little a train driver can do to avoid a collision. A train can’t swerve to avoid something or someone on the tracks. Even once the emergency brakes have been applied, a train takes a long time to stop.

“This interactive simulator is an innovative tool to reinforce important rail safety messages. It will also help road users appreciate the impact that collisions and near misses have on train drivers and railway workers.

“This, and other Rail Safety Week activities are excellent reminders of the care we need to take around trains, tracks and level crossings.”

Rail Safety Week runs through to 17 August and is coordinated by KiwiRail and TrackSAFE NZ, with the support of the NZ Police and the NZ Transport Agency.
