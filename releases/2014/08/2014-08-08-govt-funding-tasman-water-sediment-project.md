Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced funding of $120,000 for a project run by Tasman District Council to control erosion and sediment going into waterways.

“Erosion and sediment control are a problem for our water ways, but Tasman District Council has identified there is little in the way of up-to-date research or information for landowners and regional councils who need to manage erosion and sedimentation in our rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands,” Ms Adams says.

“For many landowners, limiting erosion and sediment is their main way of managing water quality, as required under the Government’s National Policy Statement for Freshwater.”

Sediment can result from activities on land like forestry, farming or earthworks, or from flooding or natural erosion.

When it enters water ways, it degrades the quality of water for drinking, recreation and plant and animal life. Murky water also makes it difficult for aquatic plants to get the light they need.

Sediment disrupts the food chain by destroying the natural habitat, affects fish egg and larvae development, and clogs fish gills, reducing growth and making fish more susceptible to disease.

Sediment deposits can also affect the depth and flow of the water, making it difficult to navigate and unsuitable for boating or swimming.

“This technical project run by the Tasman District Council will ultimately lead to better guidance on best practice erosion and sediment control for landowners and councils around the country.

“It makes sense to address this issue under a single programme, rather than have individual councils duplicating the work as they deal with the issue of sediment.”

The $120,000 funding is from a targeted round of the Government’s Community Environment Fund.

The funding round was aimed at activities that support key elements of the Government’s freshwater programme, including implementation of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management and regional planning and community participation in freshwater management.
