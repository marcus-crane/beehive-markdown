Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced Te Oranganui has been selected to lead a $2 million anti-obesity initiative in Wanganui which will help families improve their health.

Mr Ryall shared with news with locals while out and about in Wanganui this morning with Whanganui MP Chester Borrows.

“Healthy Families NZ is a new $40 million initiative which aims to improve people’s health where they live, learn, work and play in order to prevent obesity,” says Mr Ryall.

“It is a complete reform of the way we address the underlying causes of poor health, including obesity, smoking and excessive drinking.

“Te Oranganui, who is also the lead agent of Whānau Ora in the region, will lead the Healthy Families NZ initiative in Wanganui. They will recruit a dedicated health promotion workforce who will work with schools, early childhood education centres, workplaces and sport clubs to encourage and support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.

“Encouraging individuals and their families to live healthy, active lives is part of the government’s approach to reducing the prevalence and consequences of chronic disease in New Zealand,” says Mr Ryall.

From October 2014, Healthy Families NZ will roll out to 10 communities – East Cape, the Far North District, Invercargill, Lower Hutt, Rotorua, Whanganui, Manukau, Manurewa-Papakura, Spreydon-Heathcote and Waitakere. It is expected to reach around 900,000 New Zealanders.

Healthy Families NZ is based on one of the very few anti-obesity programmes that actually work - Healthy Together Victoria programme from Australia.
