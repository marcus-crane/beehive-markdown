Foreign Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand is deeply disturbed at today’s reports indicating the involvement of Russian troops in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 

“If these reports are confirmed, such actions will escalate the crisis at a time when efforts should be directed to easing tensions,” Mr McCully says.

“The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met today to discuss these developments. The Council should take a leading role in addressing this situation. 

“It is important that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is fully respected and that all parties adhere to international law.

“New Zealand supports the efforts of the UN Secretary General and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and encourages both of them to continue using their good offices to end the fighting,” Mr McCully says.
