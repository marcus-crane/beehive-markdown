Associate Minister of Tourism Todd McClay emphasised the importance of the Government’s Tourism Growth Partnership as he helped launch Skyline’s Rotorua Mountain Bike Gravity Park today.

The Government’s Tourism Growth Partnership co-invested $225,000 alongside the $225,000 invested by Skyline Gravity Park to upgrade the park to international race standards.

“The Park offers an outstanding experience to the New Zealand mountain biking scene and will also grab interest from international mountain biking events and visitors,” Mr McClay says.

“Dedicated gondola cabins designed to take up to four bikes and riders per trip, along with nine kilometres of trails creates capacity for 3,000 downhill runs a day.”

“The improvements will lift Rotorua’s Skyline Gravity Park to world class standards and help to attract more international events, boost Rotorua’s global presence, and bring more visitors to the region.”

“The new and improved Gravity Park will provide a significant boost to the local economy.”

The Tourism Growth Partnership provides Government funding of $32 million over four years to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities and overcome barriers to growth in the tourism sector.

“Investment from the Tourism Growth Partnership helps drive the innovation and creativity already within our tourism sector,” Mr McClay says.
