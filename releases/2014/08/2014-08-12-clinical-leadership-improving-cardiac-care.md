The National Cardiac Network, which is led by cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, GPs, nurses and other health professionals, continues to make gains and improve cardiac services in New Zealand.

Health Minister Tony Ryall today met with Prof Ralph Stewart, the new chair of the Network and a cardiologist at Auckland City Hospital.

“This network is an excellent example of the strong clinical leadership in our public health services,” says Mr Ryall.

“When the National Cardiac Surgery Clinical Network was formed in 2009, New Zealanders needing cardiac surgery faced lengthy and distressing delays.

“Thanks to the hard work of cardiac clinicians we have turned this situation around – more New Zealanders are now getting cardiac surgery and they are getting it faster.

“Significant progress has been made in increasing the volume of cardiac surgery operations, improving the geographic equity of cardiac surgery provision, enhancing the effectiveness of clinical prioritisation, and reducing the number of patients waiting for surgery.

“Effective clinical leadership is a fundamental driver of improved front line health care and this National-led Government strongly supports and encourages clinical leadership,” says Mr Ryall.

There are many examples of clinicians working together to improve health services, including the Regional Cancer Networks, Major Trauma Clinical Network, Stroke Networks, National Diabetes Service Improvement Group and the National Renal Transplant Leadership Team.
