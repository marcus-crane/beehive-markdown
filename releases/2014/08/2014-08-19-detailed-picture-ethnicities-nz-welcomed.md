Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner is encouraging community groups to make use of information released today on 143 ethnic groups.

Statistics New Zealand today released detailed statistics on 143 of the 300 ethnic groups recorded in the 2013 Census.

“Ethnic group profiles provide in-depth and valuable information about the groups that make up New Zealand’s population and show us how they are changing over time.

“We rely on people to supply their information, and for community groups to encourage them.  These profiles are where those people and groups get the payback for their help,” Ms Wagner says.

The profiles include information on population, languages, education, income housing and households.  The information is presented in a variety of easy to use formats, including simple tables, graphs and key facts.

“The government is strongly focused on making sure New Zealand has the information it needs to grow and prosper, and having detailed information on the communities that make up our country is key to this,” Ms Wagner says.
