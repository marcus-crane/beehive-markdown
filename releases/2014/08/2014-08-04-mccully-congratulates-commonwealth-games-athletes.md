Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand’s team at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games has done the country proud.

“Our Games team put in an excellent performance. We finished sixth on the table with 45 medals, including,14 gold, 14 silver and 17 bronze,” Mr McCully says.

“There many inspirational moments at the Games, including, Valerie Adams claiming gold in the women’s shot put and the performance of a number of up-and-coming young athletes. It was fitting that Valerie won New Zealand’s 600th Commonwealth Games medal, as she is an outstanding athlete.

"15 of New Zealand’s medals were won in bike disciplines. This fully justifies the Government’s decision to commit to the $30 million Avantidrome in Cambridge, which provides a world class training environment for the future.

“Athletes from a multitude of sports including judo, boxing, weightlifting, lawn bowls, shooting, and swimming ended up on the Podium, as well as our Rugby Sevens, hockey and netball teams.

“To see Kiwis winning medals in so many different events shows what good shape New Zealand sport is in.

“Glasgow staged an exceptional Games and I would like to acknowledge the organisers and volunteers that made the event such a success,” Mr McCully says.
