Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced the Government’s Tourism Growth Partnership (TGP) is investing in two further organisations in order to grow the tourism sector in New Zealand.

The TGP is investing $600,000 in the Canterbury Tourism Partnership to support the rebuild of the tourism sector in the Canterbury region, and $50,000 to China Travel Service NZ Ltd.

“That brings the total government investment into the projects to $4.49 million in this first round of funding. This is in addition to $23.65 million from the applicants, giving a total $28.1 million investment in the tourism industry,” says Mr Key.

The Canterbury Tourism Partnership focuses on delivering a strong recovery of the Australian holiday market after the devastating earthquakes in 2010 and 2011.

The partnership will also lift the Canterbury tourism sector’s capability to attract more leisure visitors from China and will broaden new commercial opportunities for tourism operators across the region. The programme is a collaboration between government, Christchurch International Airport and Christchurch City Council.

“China Travel Service (NZ) Ltd will use their existing networks to market tourism experiences to Chinese Australians.”

The TGP fund prioritises funding to proposals which show innovation and get better value from our international visitors’ expenditure as well as projects that can make a real difference to lift productivity of the tourism sector and overcoming barriers to growth.

“Investing in a wide range of innovative tourism projects will help the New Zealand tourism industry as a whole – and create jobs in New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government has made $32 million available over four years to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities in the tourism sector. It is a co-investment programme. For each project approved for investment, the Government will provide up to 50 per cent of the required funding.
