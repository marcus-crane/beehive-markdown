Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has congratulated Palmerston North City Council and Spearhead Manawatu on successfully securing investment from the Ports of Auckland, the Port of Napier, and IcePak, for a new Inland Port and intermodal freight hub for the city and the region.

"This investment is a strong vote of confidence in the region's vision for Palmerston North to be a freight and logistics hub for the lower North Island,” Mr Joyce says.

"I know the city's leaders have been passionate advocates for this project for some time, and councils across the region have been very supportive.

"The announcement will be viewed especially positively as the investment partners have committed to the project on its merits and the merits of the city, without needing any government subsidy.”

Mr Joyce says the announcement dovetails nicely into the joint central and local government Manawatu-Whanganui Regional Growth Study that he announced last month with Minister Guy.

"When you add in the investment the Government is making in the Wellington to Levin Road of National Significance and in ultra-fast and rural broadband upgrades across the region, the Manawatu-Whanganui is fast becoming one of the most connected regions in the country. This will help immeasurably in attracting further investment and jobs to the region," Mr Joyce says.
