Minister for Whānau Ora Tariana Turia has announced that the trialling of a new national information sharing system for Whānau Ora is now underway. Four Whānau Ora sites are trialling the new system that will eventually be available to all Whānau Ora providers and collectives.

“We’ve been working closely with providers and collectives on the design of the system to make sure it meets their needs and provides consistency in data gathering and sharing,” says Minister Turia.

“Once the new system is in place, providers will be able to collect, use and report on whānau information and outcomes and share this information across providers in the collective. For whānau it means they won’t have to start from scratch every time they talk to a different service – and they’ll also be able to access their own data as well.”

“At the core of Whānau Ora has been the desire to integrate services and support whānau to navigate what can sometimes be a complex system of government.   The value of information sharing is that it will enable whānau to plan their own pathway forward by bringing together all the necessary information in to one place,” says Mrs. Turia.

The four initial sites for the trial are Northland (where four collectives will collaborate as one site), Kotahitanga Rōpu in Auckland, Te Oranganui Iwi Authority in Whanganui and Pacific Trust Canterbury in Christchurch.

The project is being coordinated by the Ministry of Health’s Māori Health team on behalf of Te Puni Kōkiri, Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Education. The system will be further refined based on feedback from the initial trial before being rolled out across all remaining collectives. The trial ends in December.
