Building and Construction Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced two new appointments and five reappointments to the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board.

“The Board has an important role in protecting the health and safety of New Zealanders by ensuring that plumbers, gasfitters and drainlayers are competent and properly licensed,” Dr Smith says.

“Today’s appointments bring a wealth of skills and knowledge to the Board, with backgrounds and years of experience across the industry and with a mix of governance, commercial operations, and higher education.”

The two new appointments are Richard Merrifield and Colleen Upton. The five reappointments are Nicholas Fleckney, Craig O’Connell, Ian Rowe, John Simmiss and Sue Simons. Ms Simons has been reappointed until February 2015 to allow her to complete a disciplinary hearing which is currently underway.  She will be replaced by Ms Upton on the Board once the hearing is complete.

The Board is a statutory body established under the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board Act 2006 and has responsibility for administering the registration and licensing systems of plumbers, gasfitters and drainlayers, as well as setting the minimum standards for registration and ensuring that the people carrying out regulated work are competent to do so.
