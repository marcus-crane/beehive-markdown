Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the responsibility for Chatham Islands health services will transfer to Canterbury District Health Board (DHB) from Hawkes Bay DHB next year.

Between 27 May and 17 June this year, the Ministry of Health held community meetings in the Chatham Islands and received a total of 106 submissions around a potential transition to a new district DHB.

Over 70 per cent of respondents indicated that responsibility should be transferred from Hawke’s Bay DHB, with the majority of those favouring a change to Canterbury DHB.

Mr Ryall says Canterbury has been identified as the best placed DHB to provide services that reduce the impact of travel on patients, increase access to family support, and reduce subsequent travel costs.

“Canterbury DHB has a strong track record of working successfully with rural and remote communities, and will continue to provide the same services currently delivered by Hawkes Bay DHB from a more convenient location.

“The transition from Hawke’s Bay DHB to Canterbury DHB will commence next year,” says Mr Ryall.
