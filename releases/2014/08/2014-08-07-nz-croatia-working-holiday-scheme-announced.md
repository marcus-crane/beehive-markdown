Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today that up to 100 young New Zealanders will be able to spend a year in Croatia following the signing of a reciprocal Working Holiday Scheme.

"This arrangement will enable young New Zealanders and Croatians aged between 18 and 30 to holiday or work each other’s countries,” Mr McCully says.

“Croatia is the newest member of the European Union, and this arrangement complements the arrangements we have in place with other EU nations.

“There is also a strong Croatian community here in New Zealand and we are looking to develop our trade and business ties with Croatia,” Mr McCully says.

The arrangement has already come in effect and young New Zealanders and Croatians can start applying to access the scheme. For more information visit [www.immigration.govt.nz](http://www.immigration.govt.nz)
