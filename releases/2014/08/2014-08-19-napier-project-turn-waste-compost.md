Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced funding of $468,000 for a facility in Napier which turns construction, demolition and industrial waste into compost.

The funding has been awarded to BioRich from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund.

“This money will help BioRich expand its facility to accept waste streams such as bark, wool dust, paper towels, plasterboard and tannery waste,” Ms Adams says.

“BioRich currently processes about 30,000 tonnes of organic waste annually. It is estimated the expanded facility will be able to process an additional 6600 tonnes per year at the site.

“The composting facility offers an innovative solution to deal with wastes that are usually difficult to process.

“The material that is being composted would normally go to landfill. Instead, it is being processed into agricultural grade compost which can be used to enrich the soils of Hawke’s Bay farms.

“This project is a win-win for the local economy and environment. It will reduce pollution and the amount of material going to landfill, while providing nutrients to make soils more productive and reduce the need for fertilisers.

“Any initiative that reduces material going to landfill is making a difference for our environment.”

Several Hawke’s Bay companies are already supplying their waste to BioRich for composting.

The $468,000 for the project comes from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund.  The Fund provides financial support to projects which increase resource efficiency and decrease the amount of waste going to landfill.

To date the Government has awarded more than $50 million to 100 projects through the Fund.
