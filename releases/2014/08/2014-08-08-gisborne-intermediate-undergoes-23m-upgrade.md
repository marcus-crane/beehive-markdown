The first phase of weathertightness repairs to Gisborne Intermediate School is now complete, Associate Minister of Education Nikki Kaye says.

The $2.3 million project is being carried out in three phases as part of the Ministry of Education’s Building Improvement Programme, which was set up in 2009 to manage the testing and remediation of school buildings affected by water damage.

“The administration building has been re-clad and re-roofed, and work on the  technology block will begin this month,” Ms Kaye says.

“Construction of a new music suite - with an outdoor performance area at the heart of the school - will begin in December, with work expected to be complete in the middle of next year.”

More than 100 students are learning to play a musical instrument so the enhanced building will provide a great environment for students to flourish, Ms Kaye says.

“Once fully complete, the school will be a warm, healthy and modern learning environment that will provide safe, contemporary spaces to help inspire students to learn.”

About 320 buildings at approximately 200 schools throughout New Zealand have so far been remediated or rebuilt, resulting in modern learning environments that support modern teaching styles, Ms Kaye says.
