The next round of applications for the Racing Safety Development Fund opens today, Minister for Racing Nathan Guy has announced.

“The fund supports important projects around the country that improve racecourse health and safety standards,” Mr Guy says.

“This has included improvements for safety running rails, irrigation and drainage, horse containment fences, and grandstand repairs.”

A total of $1 million is available from the fund in the 2014/2015 financial year, and all racing clubs and racing code bodies can apply.

New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses.

“Racecourse health and safety is very important for the industry. This includes the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators, officials, and others involved in racing.”

Applications must be submitted by 30 September 2014.
