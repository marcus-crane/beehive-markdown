The rollout of fast internet to schools is almost five months ahead of schedule with 700 schools now connected to the Government’s Managed Network, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“The 700th connection was the target for the end of the first year so it is great news that this milestone has been reached so early. It is a tribute to the team at Network for Learning (N4L) to have connected so many schools so quickly,” Ms Kaye says.

“Today I am pleased to confirm that the milestone was reached with the connection of Te Kura o Waikare, a kura in Waikare, the Bay of Islands.

“This is a significant achievement – the sooner we provide high-quality, high-speed internet to students, teachers and schools, the better we can ensure that every student can benefit from technology to achieve their best, no matter where they are in New Zealand.”

The Government is investing $211 million in the Managed Network, which will provide quick and reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering and network security services for all New Zealand schools wishing to participate.

“Having access to predictable, ultra-fast broadband is critical in enabling schools to explore more innovative approaches to teaching and learning, using the internet and digital technologies,” Ms Kaye says.

“More than 225,000 students are now using a Government-funded internet connection running at reliably high speeds.

“As of today, more than 2260 schools have registered their interest in joining the Managed Network.”

N4L is on track to connect all participating schools to the Managed Network by the end of 2016.

*Editor's notes:*

**What is the N4L Managed Network?**

The Managed Network connects schools via a secure data network, offering higher levels of service quality and support than has been previously available. It will provide schools with fast access to the internet and more reliable connections.

The Managed Network operates over the best mix of ultra-fast, rural and remote broadband available in New Zealand. It is centrally managed; schools will no longer need to support their own internet connection, which will help reduce ICT complexity and costs.

**How many more schools will be connected in 2014?**

N4L aims to connect another 300 schools this year, for a total of 1000 or more schools connected to the Managed Network.

**Te Kura o Waikare**

Te Kura o Waikare is a decile 1 kura located in Waikare, a small rural settlement near Kawakawa in the Bay of Islands.
