Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today announced draft licencing rules for the use of television white space devices in New Zealand.

“Television white space offers opportunities for new ways to deliver wireless services such as broadband,” Ms Adams says.

“More efficient use of the radio spectrum, such as through the use of white space, will be increasingly important as new technologies continue to drive demand for wireless frequencies.”

Television white spaces are the unused frequencies between television channels.

They cannot be used for other television channels without harmful interference occurring, but in many cases there is potential for them to be used for wireless broadband or other technologies.

The draft rules have been designed to protect the interests of existing spectrum users – television broadcasters and wireless microphone users.

White space users in New Zealand would need to gain radio licences and conform to American or European Union device standards.

The draft rules are intended as an interim measure to allow users to trial white space technologies. They may be replaced by a more permanent licensing framework in the future.

The draft white space licencing rules have been released for technical consultation by Radio Spectrum Management in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
