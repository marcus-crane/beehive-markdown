Associate Minister of Tourism Todd McClay today announced the opening of an $8 million, four year funding round to enhance and maintain the Great Rides of Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“This Government is investing in improving our tourism infrastructure to make sure high-value visitors have a great experience and New Zealand remains a top tourist destination,” Mr McClay says.

The first round opens on 22 August and will start the distribution of $2 million available this year. This is a contestable-investment fund, and applicants need to provide at least matching funding.

The deadline for applications is 30 September.

“Proposals that aim to improve the safety and quality of the Great Ride trails will be given priority for funding.”

“The opening of the fund is great timing for trails like the Twin Coast Cycle Trail in Northland which suffered major damage as a result of recent storms and flooding in the region.”

Repairing storm damage or other unforeseen natural disasters on the Great Rides network is an important aspect of this funding,” Mr McClay says.

Of the 23 Great Rides 16 have been completed, with only 124km of the 2,678km network remaining to be built. Four more trails are due to open by Christmas 2014 and construction on the remaining three trails is expected to continue into 2015.

An evaluation report showed the trails are going from strength to strength. Last year the Great Rides experienced a 56 per cent average growth rate, with an estimated 97,000 trail users for the month of January 2014 alone.
