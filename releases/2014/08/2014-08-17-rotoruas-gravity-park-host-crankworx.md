Associate Minister of Tourism Todd McClay has welcomed the announcement that the world's biggest mountain bike event, Crankworx, is coming to Rotorua and said this will be celebrated by the New Zealand tourism sector.

Born in Whistler, British Columbia, Crankworx is a multi-disciplinary mountain bike festival celebrating endurance, supreme flow, monster air and vertical-dropping riding.

More than 750 international riders and competitors will participate in this event in Rotorua over five days in March 2015.

Mr McClay said that high quality cycling facilities were adding to New Zealand's appeal as an exceptional visitor destination. Rotorua being named a host city for the 2015-2017 seasons will further promote New Zealand to high spending international visitors and the world's cycling fraternity.

"The Government has invested $225 000 in the newly opened Rotorua Gravity Park as part of the $32 million Tourism Growth Partnership fund to boost innovation and productivity in tourism. The upgrading of Gravity Park to international standard means we are better able to attract major events of this calibre," Mr McClay says.

"As host venue, Rotorua's Gravity Park is now recognised as world class. The return on the Government's investment is being repaid already."

"This is an excellent result for New Zealand and the wider cycling community.  I congratulate all involved in bringing this world class event to our shores," Mr McClay says.
