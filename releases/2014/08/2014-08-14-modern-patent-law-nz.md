Commerce Minister Craig Foss today welcomed the modernisation of New Zealand patent laws.

The Patent Regulations 2014, under the Patents Act 2013, was today published in the New Zealand Gazette. The legislation comes into force on 13 September and replaces the Patents Act 1953.

“This legislation will bring New Zealand patent law into the 21st century with a more consistent, high quality patent examination process,” Mr Foss says.

“It ensures innovations are novel and useful while providing greater freedom to adapt and improve existing innovations.

“This is a significant step forward – Kiwi inventions will enjoy world-class intellectual property protection. 

“Aligning our patent laws more closely with international best practice will boost innovation and help create a more productive and competitive economy – an important part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda.

The Patent Regulations 2014 will be available from tomorrow at: [www.legislation.govt.nz](http://www.legislation.govt.nz)
