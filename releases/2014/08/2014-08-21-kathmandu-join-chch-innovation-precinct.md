Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the announcement that Kathmandu will become the second large private sector company to headquarter itself in Christchurch's new innovation precinct.

Kathmandu announced today it will locate its new worldwide head office within the Precinct, and will be bringing in over 150 staff including its product design, systems and online development teams to the central city location.

“Kathmandu has a proud history in Christchurch. It opened its first New Zealand store in the city in 1991 and since then has firmly established itself as one of New Zealand’s most iconic brands,” says Mr Joyce.

“Innovation and excellence in design is at the core of Kathmandu’s operations and the company will be a very good fit for the Christchurch Innovation Precinct."

Kathmandu joins Vodafone as key anchor tenants in the new precinct. Vodafone has previously announced that it will be locating its South Island Headquarters in the precinct with capacity for up to 350 staff. Construction has started on the Vodafone Centre which will also host one of only six unique Vodafone Xone technology incubators worldwide.

Mr Joyce says that with this latest announcement from Kathmandu, it is clear that the Innovation Precinct will become a top address for innovative firms located in the city.

"The Christchurch innovation Precinct will contain an exciting array of large companies, growth companies, and start-ups; plus supporting agencies like Callaghan Innovation and NZTE. When you mix in the new ICT graduate school and the CPIT campus just up the road, the Precinct will be a hotbed of commercial innovation in the new-look Christchurch CBD,” Mr Joyce says.

The Christchurch Innovation Precinct covers an area of approximately 3.6 hectares in the south-east corner of the Urban Frame and will be located within three city blocks bounded by Lichfield, Manchester, St Asaph, High, Tuam and Madras Streets.
