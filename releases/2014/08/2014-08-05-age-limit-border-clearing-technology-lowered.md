Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today announced the age limit to use the border clearing technology SmartGate has been lowered from 16 to 12.

It follows a trial of 35,000 young New Zealand and Australian ePassport holders using the self-processing gates to clear Customs.

“Lowering the age to 12 means more families, school groups and sports teams can enjoy faster border processing, which I’m sure will be welcome news to those travelling during busy periods like the school holidays.

“The change is expected to result in an additional 192,000 people using the self-processing gates every year,” Ms Wagner says.

All New Zealand, Australian, United Kingdom and American travellers aged 12 and over who have an ePassport can now use SmartGate,

SmartGate uses electronic information in ePassports and facial recognition technology to carry out Customs and Immigration checks.  This automated process assists border security by allowing Customs officers to spend more time focussing on high-risk travellers.

Nine million people have self-processed at the border since late 2009.
