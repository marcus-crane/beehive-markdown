Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the appointment of Dr Margaret Wilsher as the replacement crown monitor for Capital and Coast District Health Board (DHB).

Dr Wilsher replaces Debbie Chin, who was appointed acting chief executive by the DHB last year.

“Dr Wilsher is the Chief Medical Officer at Auckland District Health Board and a Respiratory Physician who has experience working both in the public and private sectors.

“Her clinical background and considerable experience in clinical cooperation will be of great value to the DHB,” says Mr Ryall.

Dr Wilsher’s appointment is for one year and commenced on 7 August 2014.
