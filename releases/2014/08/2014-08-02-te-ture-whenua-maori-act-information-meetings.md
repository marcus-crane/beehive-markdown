Crown officials and iwi representatives will report on progress in the legislative reform of Māori land governance and seek feedback from landowners in a series of 19 hui nationwide this month. 

Crown and Māori technical experts are currently developing a bill to reform Te Ture Whenua Māori Act. They will present on how this legislation will give effect to the principles for governing Māori land law outlined in the report of an expert panel released in April.

“I invite all Māori land owners and interested parties to attend these hui and hear about and discuss the progress of the legislation,” Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Christopher Finlayson said. “For example, the bill will move away from a system where owners must apply to the Māori Land Court in order to have a Trust appointed, towards a scheme where Maori land owners will be able to make their own arrangements for governance bodies.”

“It is also intended to introduce a new dispute resolution service to help Māori land owners resolve issues themselves without litigation.”
