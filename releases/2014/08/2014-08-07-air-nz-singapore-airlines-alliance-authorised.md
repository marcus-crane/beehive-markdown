Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has authorised a strategic alliance between Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines, which will see Air New Zealand fly into Singapore for the first time since 2006.

Mr Brownlee says the decision is good news for air travellers, who will benefit from more flights and lower fares between New Zealand and Singapore.

“Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines have committed to offering 30 per cent more seats every week between Auckland and Singapore. This will more than compensate for capacity lost when Jetstar withdrew from the route, and ensure the availability of low fares”.

The services the airlines will be able to provide through the alliance should help strengthen New Zealand’s ties with emerging markets throughout Asia. The alliance will also provide opportunities for a continuation and expansion of the role Singapore has long played as a hub for travel between New Zealand and Europe.

Under the alliance, the two airlines will coordinate operations on the Auckland-Singapore and Christchurch-Singapore routes, leveraging their strengths to offer passengers a better product. The alliance will provide a far greater range of connecting flights throughout South East Asia, India and Europe.

Mr Brownlee has authorised the alliance for an initial term of four years. During this period, the airlines will need to demonstrate that the alliance has delivered real benefits to consumers, and that it has not had an adverse impact on competition in other markets.
