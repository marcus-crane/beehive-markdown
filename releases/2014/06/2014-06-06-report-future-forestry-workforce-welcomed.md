A report released today provides important information to help transform the forestry industry says Associate Primary Minister Jo Goodhew.

“*The Future capability needs for the primary industries in New Zealand* report will help in attracting, training and retaining that future forestry workforce,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Future improvements in the skill level of the workforce will be a critical requirement for achieving the forestry industry’s strategy targets.

“The report found in 2012, 48 per cent of the workforce had a formal post-school qualification. It suggests this will need to increase to 77 per cent by 2025.

Chair of the Wood Processors and Manufacturers Association of New Zealand Brian Stanley has welcomed the report.

Mr Stanley believes it shows the wood industry has the potential to increase export revenue and employment by exporting processed products of greater value through more high-tech capital-intensive manufacturing.

The report found the largest job growth in the forestry industry is expected for support and sales workers, technicians and trade workers, non-farm managers, labourers, and transport and plant operators.

“This information will ensure the industry is well placed to lift productivity and profitability of their sector,” says Mrs Goodhew.

*The Future capability needs for the primary industries in New Zealand* report was supported and guided by primary industry representatives and funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, DairyNZ, and Beef + Lamb New Zealand.
