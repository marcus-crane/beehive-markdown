To mark World Environment Day, Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced the finalists for the 2014 Green Ribbon Awards, which honour outstanding contributions to protecting New Zealand's environment.

“Over the 24 years of the Green Ribbon Awards, more than 150 environmental champions have been recognised for their initiative, commitment and dedication to tackling environmental issues,” Ms Adams says.

“For this year’s awards, 113 nominations were received across 12 categories. The finalists come from a range of backgrounds and the work they do is challenging, time-consuming and sometimes unrewarded.

“World Environment Day is an ideal occasion to show the human face of environmental issues, and promote the fantastic work that is happening in our communities

“Tackling environmental issues is not easy. The Green Ribbon Awards provide an important opportunity to appreciate and showcase the diverse, innovative and interesting environmental activities that are happening around New Zealand.

“New Zealanders have always valued and taken part in voluntary activities, but it is also great to see the range of private and public sector groups that are now making sustainability an integral part of their business.”

The finalists include councils, schools, scientists, community organisations, conservation groups, and businesses. Their environmental projects include waste reduction, protecting native species, public education, lowering carbon footprints, reducing water pollution, and more sustainable business practices.

The finalists will attend an awards dinner at Parliament on June 16. Winners will be announced in each category, and then an overall supreme winner will be revealed.

The finalists are:

It is a partnership between Genesis Energy, the Department of Conservation, Forest and Bird and the Central North Island Blue Duck Trust and it supports 14 whio protection sites throughout New Zealand. Thanks to the programme the number of whio pairs in the wild has increased and it is expected that the 10 year Whio Recovery Plan will be delivered three years ahead of schedule.

**Reducing our Greenhouse gas emissions**

*Auckland War Memorial Museum*

The museum has reduced its carbon emissions by 50 per cent in the last three years, resulting in 1000 fewer tonnes of carbon entering the atmosphere. The museum has a recycling programme and turns food waste and paper towels into fertiliser, which means that 72 per cent less waste is going to landfill.

*Kapiti Coast District Council*

The council has reduced its greenhouse gas footprint by 48 per cent. The council has less waste going to landfill and is using less energy due to the refurbishment of the Civic Building and better management of the Waikanae Pool. The Council is focussed on making sustainability affordable and savings are recycled into the budget for new energy conservation projects. Other councils are now replicating the sustainability models implemented at Kapiti Coast District Council.

*Victoria University*

The university’s energy management programme is significantly reducing the university’s carbon emissions. The programme includes the use of smart meters to identify trends in energy use, the installation of energy-saving fuel cupboards in laboratories and the use of energy-saving computer software.
