Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner is welcoming today’s release of the 2013 Disability Survey results by Statistics New Zealand.

The results provide a comprehensive source of information on disabled people in New Zealand, and the nature and cause of impairments.

“The data gives us a better picture of the disabled community and its needs, which provides the information decision-makers, service providers, individuals and advocates really need.

“This survey is also an example that Statistics New Zealand is about more than just crunching data, with it focused on looking behind the numbers to see the real people,” Ms Wagner says.

The 2013 Disability Survey will inform the New Zealand Disability Strategy and is used for monitoring and reporting on the country’s progress against implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Further information from the survey will be released in the coming months.
