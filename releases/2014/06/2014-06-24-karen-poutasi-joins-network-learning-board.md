Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the appointment of Dr Karen Poutasi to the board of Network for Learning (N4L).

N4L is the Crown company responsible for the Government’s $211 million investment in a managed network for schools, which will provide quick and reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering and network security services.

The company last week reached a milestone ahead of schedule with its 500th school connection, and is on track to connect all participating schools to the managed network by the end of 2016.

“I am delighted that Dr Poutasi is joining the N4L Board,” says Ms Kaye.  “N4L has a crucial role to play in the delivery of future-focused education.

“As a state sector expert with strong education connections, Dr Poutasi will complement N4L’s mix of directors, who between them have experience in the ICT, telecommunications and education sectors along with commercial, financial and legal expertise.”

Rick Shera, Linda Tame and Humphrey Wikeepa have been reappointed to the board.
