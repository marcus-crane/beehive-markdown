Revenue Minister Todd McClay has congratulated Inland Revenue on being named Department of the Year in TransTasman’s Annual Departmental Briefing Report.

“This is great recognition for the dedication and hard work of Inland Revenue’s staff,” Mr McClay says.

“It is particularly pleasing for the Department to be recognised for its high degree of professionalism and efficiency; two qualities that New Zealanders expect from their public sector.”

“While it is nice to receive such praise, it is extremely important that we continue to look for ways to improve our customer service.”

“The recent success of initiatives to help people pay their tax easier and faster is very encouraging.”

“One million people now use Voice ID, more than 1.7 million are registered for myIR, and parents can now provide their newborn with an IRD number when they register the birth with the Department of Internal Affairs.” 

“Our goal is always to deliver the simplest tax administration possible; one that imposes the least compliance cost on our customers and gives businesses and taxpayers the certainty they need,” Mr McClay says.
