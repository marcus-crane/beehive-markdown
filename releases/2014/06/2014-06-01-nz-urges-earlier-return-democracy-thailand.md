Foreign Minister Murray McCully has urged the leaders of Thailand’s coup to set an earlier timetable for holding elections.

“We remain deeply concerned at the military’s suspension of democracy in Thailand,” Mr McCully says.

"General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has said that it could take at least a year to hold elections and this is far too long in New Zealand's view.

"We call on the coup leaders to state their commitment to restoring democracy and fundamental human rights, such as free media and the right to peaceful assembly.

"We also urge the coup leaders to release political detainees and to engage in an open process towards reconciliation,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealanders travelling to, or living in, Thailand are encouraged to monitor developments, avoid any protests and register on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Safetravel website: [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz)
