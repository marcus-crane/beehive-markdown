Prime Minister John Key has today announced New Zealand will invest $1.25 million to support tourism and renewable energy in Niue.

“Tourism is the primary driver of economic development in Niue, creating jobs for locals, growing business and pumping foreign capital into the economy,” says Mr Key.

New Zealand will contribute $1 million over five years to assist with Niue’s tourism development.  The money will be used to develop new accommodation, and improve key infrastructure, including telecommunications, electricity, waste management and water supply.

New Zealand will also provide $250,000 to assist the Government of Niue to ensure the stability of Niue’s electricity grid as it increases the share of renewables.

“Part of supporting a viable tourism industry is reliable energy. Niue is committed to increasing the proportion of electricity generation from renewable sources, and New Zealand is very keen to support that ambition,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key made the announcement in Niue today where he met with Premier Talagi and members of the tourism sector, chamber of commerce and private sector. He also visited a number of Niue’s key tourism operations.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Niue is a special one. Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974 and we have a shared history and strong links of family and citizenship,” says Mr Key.

Niue was the final destination on the five day Pacific Mission that also saw Mr Key travel to Samoa and Tonga.
