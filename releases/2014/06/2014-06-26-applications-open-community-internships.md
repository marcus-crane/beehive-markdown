Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is inviting applications for the 2015 Community Internship Programme (CIP).

“This programme provides a chance for experienced professionals to contribute to a community organisation and to increase understanding and co-operation between the private, public and community sectors,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“It funds hapū, iwi or community groups with clearly identified needs to employ skilled professionals as interns for 12 months part-time or three to six months full-time.

“Not only does the programme provide access to new skills and knowledge between the sectors, it also builds ongoing relationships which continue after an internship ends.

“CIP provides wins for everyone involved – the community organisation, the intern and the home organisation,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Current CIP examples include the Wellington Sexual Abuse HELP Foundation (Wellington Help) which has had an intern working to improve their client appointment management systems and develop monitoring systems to track outcomes.

The Otago Youth Wellness Trust has had an intern from The Salvation Army who has been helping them to develop an action plan to address the regions relatively high rates of young people not engaged in education, employment or training.

Applications for the 2015 CIP close on September 11th. The programme is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs. Further information can be found here [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) or by calling 0800 824 824.
