Hamilton lawyer Simon Menzies has been appointed as an acting District Court Judge with a jury warrant to serve in the Hamilton District Court, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Mr Menzies was admitted to the Bar in 1974. He started his legal career with RA Young Hunter & Co in Christchurch in 1973 before joining Harkness Henry in Hamilton in 1975.  He was made a managing partner at that firm in 2007. His practice has comprised criminal, civil and family jurisdictions with regular court appearances including Court of Appeal appearances some as lead counsel.

Since the early 1990s, there has been more focus on resource management and employment law and he now heads those teams.

He has served on the Hamilton Boys High School Board of Trustees from 1998 to 2002, the last year as chair, and chaired the Waikato/Bay of Plenty District Law Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal from 2005 to 2009.
