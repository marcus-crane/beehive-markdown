Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner says the 2013 regional census tour has helped dozens of communities understand what census data can be used for and how it affects them.

More than 1500 people have attended Statistics New Zealand hosted community seminars around the country in recent weeks to learn about the census and hear the findings from the latest one held in 2013.

“The aim of the tour has been to help simplify what can be a confusing subject.  It has let the public know why information is collected in a census every five years, what it’s used for and what it means at a local level.

“I attended the Christchurch seminar today at Papanui and it provided those present a valuable insight into the community,” Ms Wagner says.

As well as sharing information from the census, the seminars also provide guidance of how to access the wealth of free information available on the Statistics New Zealand website from population and social data through to economic, environmental and trade figures.

“Census data helps to inform decision making at a national and local level, I encourage everyone to investigate the data available,” Ms Wagner says.

The census is the official count of how many people and dwellings there are in the country.  It is normally conducted every five years.  The 2011 Census was deferred until March 2013 because of the Christchurch earthquakes.
