Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the creation of the Canterbury Youth Initiative Fund, which will provide $100,000 for new initiatives for young Cantabrians.

The Ministry of Youth Development funding will help to kick-start initiatives and events for Christchurch youth, following today’s release of the results of the 2013 Youth Wellbeing Survey, Ms Kaye says.

The funding will help address concerns raised in the survey, led by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), which gathered the views of more than 3000 young people aged 12 to 24 across the greater Christchurch region.

“When we look at some comparative data from CERA, the young people of Christchurch seem to be doing better than other groups in some areas – particularly on measures of quality of life and sense of community,” Ms Kaye says.

However, the survey highlighted the need to do more in several areas, Ms Kaye says, such as the development of spaces and places, emotional wellbeing, and future plans and prospects.

“The Canterbury Youth Initiative Fund will focus on these issues by supporting the delivery of a series of initiatives and events developed by, and targeted at, young people across the greater Christchurch region.

“As a result of the earthquakes, the young people of Christchurch City in particular have lost many of the places they used to gather at, as well as sports and recreation facilities.

“With this in mind, the government is providing funding for youth-led initiatives to act as a catalyst for ideas and events in Canterbury. I hope that this will put young people at the heart of some of the innovative initiatives that are happening in Christchurch, and encourage their participation in city life.”
