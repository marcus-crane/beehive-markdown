Consumer Affairs Minister Craig Foss will travel to Australia today to attend a trans-Tasman consumer affairs forum.

The two-day Legislative and Governance Forum on Consumer Affairs (CAF) begins in Cairns on Thursday.

Mr Foss will join Australian Commonwealth, state and territory ministers to discuss a range of consumer affairs and fair trading matters.

“CAF is an excellent opportunity to advance the Single Economic Market agenda and establish a joint approach to international consumer issues,” Mr Foss says.

“New Zealand has recently made a number of changes to consumer law, which I’m sure will be of great interest to forum members.”

Mr Foss will also meet Bruce Billson, the minister overseeing the Australian Competition Review.

“New Zealand and Australia’s competition laws are closely aligned, our competition agencies have strong collaborative relationships and many New Zealand business operate on both sides of the Tasman.”
