Justice Minister Judith Collins has joined 70 other Ministers from around the world and pledged New Zealand’s commitment to a global effort to help end sexual violence in conflict.

Ms Collins has recently returned from London where she attended The Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. The Summit was chaired by UK Foreign Secretary, William Hague and the Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Angelina Jolie.

“It was a privilege to stand alongside government leaders and representatives from around the world to pledge New Zealand’s commitment to this global issue,” Ms Collins says. 

“Our nation is committed to preventing sexual violence and improving women’s participation to help with peace and security, particularly in our Pacific region.”

Addressing the conference, Ms Collins spoke of New Zealand’s positive record and continued commitment to ensuring strong female representation in our Police and Armed Forces, both at home and abroad.

“Women have been able to participate in all areas of the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) since 2000.  All roles, including combat, are open to women – however we still have a long way to go to ensure equal participation at all levels of our Forces,” Ms Collins says. 

“New Zealand recognises our commitments under UN Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and Security and will continue to focus on recruitment and leadership of women in the Police and Armed Forces.”

While in London Ms Collins also met with UK Justice Secretary Rt Hon Chris Grayling. Both Ministers discussed New Zealand’s and England and Wales’ recent family court reforms and signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support continued information sharing on these matters.
