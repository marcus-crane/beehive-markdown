The rollout of fast internet to schools has reached a milestone ahead of schedule, with 500 schools now connected to the Government’s Managed Network, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

The Government is investing $211 million in the Network for Learning (N4L) programme, which will provide quick and reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering and network security services for participating New Zealand schools.

“I am pleased to announce that the rollout is progressing ahead of schedule and that more than 900 schools are expected to be connected to the Managed Network by the end of this year,” Ms Kaye says.

“This initiative will ensure that every student will be able to benefit from technology to achieve their best, no matter where they are in New Zealand.

“Having access to predictable, ultra-fast broadband is critical in enabling schools to explore more innovative approaches to teaching and learning, using the internet and digital technologies.”

N4L is on track to connect all participating schools to the Managed Network by the end of 2016.
