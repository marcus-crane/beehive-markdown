Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew says the latest SuperGold recruitment campaign has achieved its aim of signing up more law firms. 

“In the last two and a half years the programme has flourished, with the number of businesses offering discounts to senior citizens more than quadrupling,” says Mrs Goodhew.

At the end of May, there were 641,911 SuperGold Card holders, and a total of 7,187 businesses representing 11,757 outlets offering discounts for cardholders.

“To ensure the SuperGold card is truly useful to older people, we’ve been targeting businesses which can offer discounts on everyday expenses,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“To complement the mix of providers already on-board the latest recruitment campaign focused on businesses offering legal services.”

“There are now 175 outlets offering a SuperGold discount for legal services such as setting up wills, trusts and enduring powers of attorney. That’s up from 55 outlets at the same time two years ago.

“New Zealand’s ageing population is well documented, with projections indicating that by 2036, 23 per cent of the population, around 1.2 million, will be aged 65 and over,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“So it makes good business sense to sign up to the SuperGold programme as a way of attracting the increasing *silver dollar*,” says Mrs Goodhew.
