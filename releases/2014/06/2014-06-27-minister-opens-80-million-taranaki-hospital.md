Health Minister Tony Ryall will today open the new $80 million clinical building at Taranaki Hospital which will help meet the current and future health needs of the region.

“Taranaki now boasts a modern, user-friendly, four-storey facility which will improve the experience for both patients and staff.

“The new development will ensure the 109,000 people living in Taranaki continue to receive better, faster, and more convenient care in the future” says Mr Ryall.

“With six new operating theatres this new facility will make it easier for Taranaki DHB to provide more hip, knee and other elective surgery for the community.

“There are technological innovations such as an electronic touch screen inpatient whiteboard which will vastly improve how patients move through different departments for treatment and diagnostics tests.

“There is also a new nurse calling system which will greatly improve patient comfort in wards” says Mr Ryall.

The new 14,289 square metre building also includes:

- A bigger endoscopy suite
- New outpatient surgery services – providing more convenient care to patients
- 60 medical beds, 60 surgical beds, and 30 Assessment Treatment and Rehabilitation beds
- A new 20-bed paediatric inpatient unit
- A new state-of-the-start sterile services department

“This government has invested around $1 billion into capital projects for district health boards and we will continue to invest more money to upgrade public hospitals.

“This includes the $83 million revamp at Rotorua Hospital, the new $190 million clinical services block at Middlemore Hospital, the $67 million Whakatane Hospital redevelopment, and the $27 million East Wing redevelopment at Tauranga Hospital,” says Mr Ryall.
