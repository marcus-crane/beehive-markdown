Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Dr Helen Anderson QSO to the Massey University Council.

“I’m very pleased to welcome such Dr Anderson to her new role. She’s a high-calibre appointment who will make an important contribution to the decision making of the Massey University Council,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand’s universities are operating in an increasingly competitive international environment, and University Councils have a vital role in making sure our universities perform at the highest possible level.

“Dr Anderson’s strong governance and strategic skills, together with her understanding of the science environment and the research and development system in New Zealand, will be particularly valuable for the Massey University Council.

“I also wish to recognise the valuable contribution made by the outgoing council member, Alastair Scott, and to thank him for his service.”

Dr Anderson is a former Chief Executive of the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (2004–10) and was Chief Scientific Adviser (1997–2003). She has extensive professional experience in research, government and business, including 16 years of active research experience as a seismologist before taking on leadership roles. She has represented New Zealand at international forums, including APEC and the OECD.
