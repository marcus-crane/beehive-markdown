Justice Minister Judith Collins has welcomed the Law Commission’s report on the *Liability of Multiple Defendants*, which was tabled in Parliament today.

The Report considers whether the current joint and several liability rule, applying in civil cases for property damage, should be retained, replaced or amended in general.

“As part of the Government’s response to issues raised in leaky buildings cases, the Government asked the Law Commission to review the rules governing the liability of multiple defendants,” Ms Collins said.

“The Report also considers the joint and several liability rule in the context of particular professions or industries, including the building and construction industry, auditors and accountants.

“The Government will carefully consider the Commission’s recommendations and formally respond in early 2015.

“I thank the Law Commission for its work reviewing this complex area of law.”
