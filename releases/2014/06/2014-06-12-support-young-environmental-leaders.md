A Youth Trust set up in honour of Sir Peter Blake will receive $50,000 in funding to support its 2015 and 2016 Expedition Programme, Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has announced.

The Young Blake Expedition Programme aims to follow in the footsteps of Sir Peter and motivate the next generation of environmental leaders in the conservation of the Southern Ocean and its islands.

“In February, I funded a group of 16 to 18-year-olds on a voyage to the Auckland Islands as part of the Deep South National Science Challenge. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for these young environmentalists, as well as an investment in our future,” Ms Kaye says.

“The value of the expedition programme is that it connects these young Kiwis with inspirational and established scientists, conservationists and researchers.

“Following their expedition experiences, I am delighted to hear that the participants are in turn inspiring other young people to be interested in protecting our environment, and raising awareness of the importance of the sub-Antarctic.”

The Trust strives to honour Sir Peter’s legacy by inspiring his visionary leadership qualities in all New Zealanders, and by keeping his spirit and values alive for future generations.

The expedition programme’s history:

- The Kermadecs Expedition in August 2012, in which a group of 30 young people joined a group voyage to the islands to understand their global significance. This was the programme’s inaugural expedition;
- The Christchurch Urban Expedition in May 2013, in which 50 secondary students from across New Zealand learned about freshwater and resource management, and the Christchurch rebuild; and
- The Southern Ocean and Sub-Antarctic Expedition in February 2014, in which 12  participants joined environmental leaders on a voyage to the Auckland Islands.

The 2015 and 2016 expeditions will travel to the sub-Antarctic region. In addition, the allocated funding will be used to promote online and virtual experiences, and create new educational resources for schools.
