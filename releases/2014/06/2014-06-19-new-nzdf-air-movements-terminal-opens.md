Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially opened the new Air Movements Terminal at RNZAF Base Ohakea.

“The new $12.6 million high-tech Air Movements Terminal has the capacity to process military personnel and freight more efficiently, improving the NZDF’s ability to respond to disaster relief events, and to deploy on exercises and overseas missions,” says Dr Coleman.

“Ohakea’s central location makes it a logical hub for the NZDF, where Air Force, Army and Navy personnel can assemble to deploy on major activities. With Ohakea being the third largest runway in New Zealand, the new terminal means Ohakea could also be used as a reserve international airport if large civilian aircraft are unable to land at New Zealand’s main airports.

“The Air Force will be able to conduct simultaneous domestic and international arrivals and departures, processing up to 250 passengers at once. The new terminal has been purpose built to meet New Zealand Customs, Ministry for Primary Industries, and Immigration New Zealand standards.”

The 5,800 square metre facility replaces the 300 square metre building which has been in use for three decades. The new terminal includes a freight hall, check-in area, baggage carousels, a processing area for immigration and customs, and conference facilities. The development involved local industry, including BECA, Higgins Limited, and Ebert Construction Limited.

The terminal is the last of the infrastructure development projects as part of Project Takitini to modernise and reinvigorate Ohakea.

“A total of $130 million has been spent to ensure Ohakea has modern, fit for purpose facilities. Other major projects completed include a new helicopter hangar and helicopter simulator, a maintenance support squadron, a new duty centre and perimeter fence,” says Dr Coleman.

“With new capabilities such as the A109 and NH90 helicopters coming into service, as well as preparation for the new pilot training package, it is important to ensure Ohakea has the modern infrastructure to support these capabilities.”
