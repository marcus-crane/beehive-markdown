Commerce Minister Craig Foss today released a discussion paper seeking feedback on options for introducing a bounded public interest test into New Zealand’s anti-dumping regime.

“The development of a public interest test is part of the Government’s on-going work to improve housing affordability.  It follows the removal of duties and tariffs on imported building material, as announced in the budget,” Mr Foss says.

“Under the current system there is no scope for considering the wider impact of anti-dumping duties on the economy.  While anti-dumping duties provide relief for domestic industries, the additional costs imposed on imported goods may also reduce competition and result in higher prices for New Zealanders.

“Adopting a public interest test would provide flexibility to consider whether an anti-dumping duty is actually in the best interests of the public.

“I look forward to submissions from all stakeholders.  The Government’s aim is to promote greater competition and get a better deal for all New Zealanders. This is important for helping to sustain rapid development projects like the Christchurch rebuild and Auckland’s residential construction boom.”

Submissions close 30 June 2014.
