A group of more than 400 Cancer Society volunteers from across the South Island have been named the overall winners of the 2014 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards.

As part of National Volunteer Week, Health Minister Tony Ryall will present their award, along with awards for outstanding achievers from the Lower North Island, at a celebration at Wellington Hospital this afternoon.

“These awards celebrate the volunteers whose commitment, dedication and hard work improve the quality of lives of New Zealanders,” says Mr Ryall.

“Well done to all the individuals and teams who were nominated for the awards and congratulations to those recognised as outstanding achievers.

“This is the first time we have awarded an overall winner.

“The Canterbury West Coast Division of the Cancer Society has sixteen rural support groups comprising more than 400 volunteers.

“This dedicated group of people ferry rural cancer patients to appointments, deliver meals and baking, provide companionship and help raise awareness of a disease that affects one in three New Zealanders.

“Their work is greatly valued by cancer patients and their families from Westport to Christchurch to Twizel and everywhere in between.

“It is a privilege to personally recognise these award recipients and hear inspiring stories from health volunteers in New Zealand,” says Mr Ryall.

Today’s award ceremony is taking place at 2pm at Wellington Hospital. Award ceremonies will also be held at Middlemore Hospital on Friday and at Christchurch Hospital later this month.

National Volunteer Week is from 15-21 June 2014 and is New Zealand’s largest celebration of volunteering and civic participation.
