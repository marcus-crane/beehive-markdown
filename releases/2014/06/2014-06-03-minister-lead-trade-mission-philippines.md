Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today for Manila, Philippines where he will lead a delegation of ten companies on a trade mission to raise awareness and open doors in South East Asia.

"The Philippine economy has been among the fastest growing in Asia in recent times, and this is a good time to be forging close business ties,” says Mr Groser.

“Trade with the Philippines is underpinned by the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), which has now been in force for over four years.”

There will be a number of business signings between New Zealand companies and their Philippine customers or partners in the health and technology sectors.

“This visit presents an excellent opportunity to support on-going trade activities, bilateral discussions and relationship building, and raise New Zealand’s profile in the market.”

Mr Groser will undertake bilateral meetings which include the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and with Secretary of Finance. He will also meet with leading Philippine businesspeople and some of the country's largest conglomerates.
