Labour Minister Simon Bridges has sent a clear message to adventure tourism operators – the resources are in place to complete audit safety checks before November and it is up to the industry to ensure it has world-class safety standards.

Mr Bridges this morning addressed the Tourism Industry Association in Wellington and reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to professionalising the adventure activities sector and lifting safety standards across the board.

“New Zealand is world renowned for its adventure tourism, and we have some of the best attractions in the world. We must protect that reputation. That’s why the 1 November deadline for adventure activity operators to be audited and registered is non-negotiable.”

Four new audit providers, Skills Active, Telarc, QSI Safety and Bureau Veritas, are now recognised by WorkSafe NZ to carry out adventure activity audits. 

“We are providing the industry with considerable support to help it meet its obligations under the Adventure Activity Regulations,” Mr Bridges says.

WorkSafe New Zealand has employed safety advisers offering one on one support to operators, and this week announced financial support of up to $1500 per operator for businesses that sign up for audits with recognised safety audit providers by 31 July 2014.

“The Government is doing its bit. It’s now it is up to the industry to play its part,” Mr Bridges says. 

“It has always been the responsibility of individual operators to prepare themselves for auditing and registration under the Regulations. I encourage all adventure activities operators to take advantage of the support on offer and sign up for an audit well in advance of November.”
