Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson and Minister of Youth Affairs Nikki Kaye today announced $50,000 from the Ministry of Youth Development to support youth participation in the performing arts.

“This funding will encourage young people to develop their musical and performance abilities, grow their confidence and self-management skills, and connect them with industry experts who can foster their talent and creativity,” Mr Finlayson says.

“This funding is targeted to support young people who may not otherwise have the opportunity to participate in such initiatives. I have seen the influence that positive opportunities like this can have on the lives of young people,” Ms Kaye says.

Three organisations will receive funding:

- The Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra - $20,000 to extend its Sistema programme with students transitioning from primary school to intermediate. The Otara-based programme is a free after-school and school holiday programme for decile 1 students that provides music tuition in orchestral instruments;
- The Opera Factory - $20,000 to give students from low-decile schools the opportunity to develop their singing and musical talents. Students participate in workshops, concerts and special events for the community; and
- The Play it Strange Trust - $10,000 for the Voice of Change programme, which helps college students to develop their singing, musical, recording and film-making skills.

The grants have been made from the Services for Young People fund: [http://www.myd.govt.nz/funding/services-for-young-people.html](http://www.myd.govt.nz/funding/services-for-young-people.html)
