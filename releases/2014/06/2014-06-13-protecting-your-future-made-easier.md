Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew is looking at simplifying the process and reducing the barriers to setting up enduring powers of attorney (EPA).

“A review of the 2007 amendments to the EPA has found there’s room for improvement, and work is now underway to address the issues highlighted,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“An EPA gives a person or people of your choice the right to make decisions about your property, care and welfare if you lose the ability to do so yourself.

“This could happen to any one of us at any time. If and when this happens, it’s important that we have someone we trust to act in our best interests and make those decisions for us.

“As a result of the review work is being done to simplify the forms and process for applying for an EPA. It’s important to ensure that people taking on the role of EPA understand what is required from them.

“We are also looking at whether EPAs could be made more affordable by encouraging legal service providers to offer EPA discounts through the SuperGold Card programme.

“After finding there was confusion as to what an EPA is, an information campaign is being worked on and should start in the coming weeks.

“I am confident the suggested changes will achieve the right balance between protecting people and making EPAs more accessible,” says Mrs Goodhew.
