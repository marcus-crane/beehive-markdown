A programme which sets parents up with simple and practical strategies to cope with challenging behaviour is being extended until June 2016.

The Triple P Positive Parenting Programme is being trialled by MidCentral, Bay of Plenty, Counties-Manukau and Waitemata District Health Boards and has already reached nearly two thousand parents or caregivers.

“This initiative is making a real difference for many families. Caregivers are reporting their child’s behaviour has improved and their parenting is more rewarding and less stressful,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“There are now around 340 practitioners – including social workers, teachers and nurses – trained to deliver the programme, which will allow even more families to benefit from it.”

Through the free programme, caregivers are able to have one-on-one sessions or attend workshops to discuss common parenting issues.

The Triple P co-ordinator for the Mid Central region, Nikki Walden, says from grandparents parenting grandchildren, to parents trying to get their child to stay in bed at night, families come with various reasons why they need support. 

“With the use of clear, simple and practical resources, we’re able to guide whanau to create and implement parenting plans that help to make significant changes in their homes. 

“Four sessions is all it takes, and it is heartening to see the changes that whanau make in their lives in such a short time.”

The initiative began in 2011, with $1.3 million of funding per year provided by the Ministry of Health. It targets children aged from 3 to 7 years.

The Triple P Positive Parenting Programme was developed in New Zealand by Professor Matt Sanders. He is now the Director of the Parenting and Family Support Centre at the University of Queensland, and an Adjunct Professor in Parenting Studies and Family Psychology at the University of Auckland.

The Triple P system has twice won the National Violence Prevention Award from the Commonwealth Heads of Government, and is being used in 25 countries.
