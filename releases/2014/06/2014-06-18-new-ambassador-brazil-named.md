Foreign Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Caroline Bilkey as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Brazil.

“All eyes are currently on Brazil as they host the FIFA World Cup and prepare to host the 2016 Olympics,” Mr McCully says.

“This shared passion for sport, and our Prime Minister’s visit to Latin America last year, have created real momentum in the relationship between our two countries.

“New Zealand has a strong and growing economic relationship with Brazil, which is the seventh largest economy in the world.  We have significant investments in Brazil’s dairy sector and are deepening links through education and tourism.

“Brazil is also a global player on issues of importance to New Zealand, and we work closely together on a range of international issues including global trade, international security, and climate change.

“As part of our drive to expand our relationships with Caribbean countries, Ms Bilkey will also be accredited to Suriname from Brasilia,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Bilkey is currently Chief of Protocol and has previously served as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Samoa. She will take up her role at the beginning of 2015.
