Joint research grants worth $460,000 have been awarded to seven collaborative research projects between New Zealand and Indian universities, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The winning themes range from research into health and migration patterns in the South Pacific to managing India New Zealand institutional challenges and the impact of climate change.

Mr Joyce says the joint research projects will enhance bilateral cooperation and develop stronger links between higher education institutions.

“The Tertiary Education Strategy released in March 2014 made ‘growing international linkages’ one of six priorities for New Zealand’s tertiary education organisations,” Mr Joyce says.

“Our success as a country over the next 20 years will be determined by our level of connectedness with the rest of the world. Collaborative research and learning is a vital way to build those global linkages.

“By sharing knowledge and researching issues from both a New Zealand and an India perspective the academics involved will develop a more international outlook as well as producing research of mutual benefit.”

The grants are being jointly funded by Education New Zealand, the government agency responsible for promoting international education, and the Indian University Grant Commission, a statutory body of the Indian Government responsible for the coordination and maintenance of university education standards.

This initiative is part of the India New Zealand Education Council, which seeks to enhance bilateral tertiary education cooperation between New Zealand and India.
