Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced Clare Fearnley as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the Republic of Korea.

“New Zealand and Korea have a wide ranging relationship that encompasses close political ties and a history of shared sacrifice dating back to the Korean War,” Mr McCully says.

“Korea is one of our top five goods trading partners and we are seeking to conclude Free Trade Agreement negotiations in the near future.

“The new Ambassador will have a focus on further strengthening these trade ties and promoting growth in our economic relationship.

“New Zealand continues to support efforts to bring peace and security to the Korean Peninsula,” Mr McCully says.

Clare Fearnley is currently director of the Ministry’s North Asia Division. She has also served as Director of the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei and as Consul-General in Shanghai.
