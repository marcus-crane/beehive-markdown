Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Dr Charlotte Marewa Severne to the Science Board for a term of three years.

The Science Board is responsible for making independent decisions on the allocation of funding used predominantly by research organisations for science, technology, research, and related activities.

“Science and innovation are major drivers of economic growth and international competitiveness. The Science Board plays a major role in ensuring we invest in purpose-driven research that benefits New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“Dr Severne is an important addition to the Board and the specialist knowledge she brings with her will assist them in making key strategic decisions.”

Dr Severne is Director of Severne and Associates Ltd, a company that provides advice in areas such as Māori research capacity, environmental risk assessment, and business and science planning. She was previously a senior manager at NIWA for 12 years, and held the posts of Chief Scientist Oceans Research and Chief Scientist Māori Development. Dr Severne has a PhD in geology from the University of Auckland and is of Tūwharetoa and Tūhoe affiliation.

Dr Severne will replace Professor Charles Royal on the Board. Professor Royal’s term ends on 30 June 2014.

In addition, Board member Professor Warren Tate’s term has been extended until 31 December 2014.

Professor Tate is Associate Dean Research (Health Science Division) at the University of Otago. He has held several leadership roles, and has significant experience in the academic science and health science sectors. Professor Tate has also served on international science policy bodies in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2010 he was awarded the Royal Society of New Zealand’s Rutherford Medal.
