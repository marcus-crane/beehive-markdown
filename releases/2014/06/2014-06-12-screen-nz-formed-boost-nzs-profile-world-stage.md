The government today announced the formation of Screen New Zealand, a new ‘virtual agency’ that formalises the collaboration of three existing screen agencies.

The New Zealand Film Commission, Film New Zealand and NZ On Air will work together on a number of specific projects under the umbrella of Screen NZ.

Screen NZ will play an important role delivering the government’s goals for the New Zealand screen sector – specifically to encourage more mid-sized, locally-driven productions and attract more international production.

“The formation of Screen NZ will ensure screen agencies have a common interest in helping the screen sector become financially sustainable and internationally competitive,” Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson says. “It will drive joint projects that help boost New Zealand’s profile on the world stage.”

“New Zealand is recognised for its world-class expertise in producing quality film and television.”

Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss says Screen NZ will enable these agencies to work together to pursue opportunities and address the challenges of New Zealand’s screen industry.

“In an increasingly diverse media environment, I am confident Screen NZ will make a positive contribution to New Zealand’s broadcasting and digital media sector,” Mr Foss says.

A programme of work, such as joint marketing and sector development initiatives, will be scoped in 2014/15. Screen NZ agencies will share relevant information, cooperate through joint initiatives and work with the wider screen industry and government agencies to implement the initiatives.

The formation of Screen NZ reflects the Government’s expectation that Crown entities and non-government agencies substantially funded by the Crown work together to achieve their goals.

The screen sector contributes an estimated $3.1 billion to the New Zealand economy each year and provides over 21,000 full time equivalent jobs.
