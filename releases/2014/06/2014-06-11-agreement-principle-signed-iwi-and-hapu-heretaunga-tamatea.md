The Crown has signed an Agreement in Principle to settle historical Treaty of Waitangi claims with Heretaunga-Tamatea, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Heretaunga-Tamatea is a large natural group of Hawke’s Bay hapū whose area of interest extends from southern Napier to Takapau in the central Hawke’s Bay.  They are one of six large natural groupings negotiating the settlement of the historical Treaty claims of Ngāti Kahungunu, the third largest tribal group in New Zealand.

The Agreement in Principle with Heretaunga-Tamatea sets out broad redress packages which include Crown acknowledgements of historic Treaty of Waitangi breaches and cultural, financial and commercial redress.

“The Heretaunga-Tamatea historical claims relate to significant and widespread land loss through early land purchases by the Crown and the Crown’s continued failure to recognise the interests of Heretaunga-Tamatea. As a result the iwi has suffered continued economic hardship and poverty.

This Agreement is a significant milestone towards resolving the injustices of the past and will form the basis for a Deed of Settlement.”

Heretaunga-Tamatea’s  Agreement in Principle includes financial redress of $100 million. As part of this, $2 million will be allocated to establish a habitat restoration fund for waterways in the area and $3 million for investment in marae and education initiatives.

“The government is committed to resolving all historical Treaty grievances, and this is an important step towards settling the historical Treaty claims of one of New Zealand’s largest iwi,” Mr Finlayson said.
