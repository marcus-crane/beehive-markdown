Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced a $150,000 grant to the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association (RSA).

“I am very pleased to confirm this extra support for the RSA. As we reflect on the passing of 100 years since World War One, it’s great that we can provide some assistance to help those supporting veterans in our community,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The grant will help the RSA support veterans through district welfare activities, including organising visits from welfare officers to veterans, assisting veterans to attend medical appointments, and other services.

“New Zealand owes a great debt to our veterans. It is important we recognise and support those who have served our country, and those who are currently serving.

“The RSA do a great job supporting those who have made sacrifices for our country, and it is very pleasing to be able to help them continue this work.”
