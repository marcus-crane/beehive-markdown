Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says HMNZS Canterbury has arrived in Hawaii this morning as Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) gets underway.

“HMNZS Canterbury’s docking at Pearl Harbor marks the first time in 30 years since a New Zealand ship berthed at a US Naval Base for RIMPAC. It is a tangible sign of the warmth of our relationship with the US,” says Dr Coleman.

“RIMPAC is a unique opportunity for the NZDF to strengthen relationships and interoperability with a wide range of partners. For the next month, 23 countries will exercise a range of capabilities including disaster relief, maritime security operations, and complex warfighting.

“RIMPAC helps to develop co-operative approaches to regional security and maritime conduct. As a trading nation New Zealand appreciates the importance of maritime security.

“This exercise is also a good opportunity for the NZDF to test the development of its Joint Task Force. Drawn from Navy, Army and Air Force, the Joint Task Force is a key capability contributing to regional security, and delivering on the strategic vision of the 2010 Defence White Paper.”

Over 250 NZDF personnel are taking part in RIMPAC. Assets include HMNZS Canterbury with an embarked Seasprite helicopter, a Mine Counter Measures Team, an Operational Dive Team, a P3K-2 Orion aircraft, a light infantry platoon, and headquarters staff.

In total, 47 ships, 6 submarines, more than 200 aircraft, and 25,000 personnel are participating in RIMPAC from 26 June to 1 August 2014. Brunei and China are taking part for the first time, joining Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Republic of Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, UK and US.
