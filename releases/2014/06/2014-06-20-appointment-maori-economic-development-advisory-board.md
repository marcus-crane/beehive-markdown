The Government today appointed Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith to the Māori Economic Development Advisory Board. 

The Advisory Board, established in May 2013, monitors and evaluates the implementation of He kai kei aku ringa, the Crown-Māori Economic Growth Partnership.

“He kai kei aku ringa has six goals and education is a central part of three of these goals.  The Government believes an additional member with experience in this field is important to advise on the implementation of He kai kei aku ringa,” Mr Joyce says.

“Professor Smith is an expert at linking education and research to Māori development and will add an important dimension to the work of the Advisory Board,” Dr Sharples says.

“Hei Kai Kei Aku Ringa is our blueprint for a productive and innovative Māori economy that will support better paying jobs and higher standards of living for Māori.”
