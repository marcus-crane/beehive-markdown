Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Trade Minister Tim Groser today announced the reappointment of Karen Fistonich and Robin Hapi to the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Board.

“I would like to thank Karen and Robin for their work on the board since they were first appointed in 2011, and look forward to their continued contributions to the work of NZTE,” Mr Joyce says.

“Due to their current term expiring within the pre-election period, this reappointment is for a one year term starting 19 July 2014. This will ensure continuity and stability to the board.”

Mr Groser says that NZTE's strong performance is a tribute to the Board's governance.

"NZTE is seen as delivering very well for NZ exporters. Karen and Robin are an important part of the governance team, and I'm delighted they're available to continue to serve," Mr Groser says.

Karen Fistonich is the Chairperson of the Villa Maria Estate Board and has served on that Board for 21 years, following a successful career in international banking with the ANZ. Karen is a member of the NZ Global Women’s network, which encourages women into senior and leadership roles, and a member of the New Zealand Primary Sector CEO Bootcamp.

Robin Hapi is a Callaghan Innovation Board member. His cross-board membership strengthens the alignment of both organisations. Robin has extensive governance and management experience. He is Chairman of Business and Economic Research Ltd (BERL) and previously held roles as the CEO of the former Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, Chairman of Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd and Sealord Group Chairman.
