Education Minister Hekia Parata says six respected education experts have agreed to join the advisory group working on the detailed design of Investing in Educational Success, the major initiative to raise student achievement.

“We are maintaining the momentum of our $359 million dollar investment to lift the quality and consistency of teaching and leadership across the education system, so we are ready to begin implementation from next year. This means every young New Zealander gets the best education possible.

“Earlier this month I released the report of the Working Group made up of boards of trustees, the unions, principals, and Maori and Pasifika representatives, who were helping with the design of the initiative for its successful operation.

“As part of the next steps, a newly-formed advisory group has begun regular meetings to help finalise the design and ensure its workability.

“I am delighted the following educational experts have agreed to join this work:

- Professor Graeme Aitken, Dean of Education at Auckland University
- Professor Michael Fullan, Professor Emeritus at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto;
- Professor Gail Gillon, Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Canterbury
- Professor Stuart McNaughton, Faculty of Education, University of Auckland
- Dr Jenny Poskitt, Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Education at Massey University
- Dr Cathy Wylie, Chief Researcher at the New Zealand Council for Educational Research

“They all have strong records of how to improve education to get the very best for our kids and from schools and teachers.

“Investing in Educational Success creates Communities of Schools to systematically strengthen collaboration between principals, teachers and schools in order to raise student achievement,” Ms Parata says.

- Lorraine Kerr, President of the New Zealand School Trustees Association
