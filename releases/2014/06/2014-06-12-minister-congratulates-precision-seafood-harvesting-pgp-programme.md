Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has today acknowledged the achievement of the Precision Seafood Harvesting Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) programme at the KiwiNet awards last night.

The Precision Seafood Harvesting PGP programme was recognised by both the People’s Choice and the Research Entrepreneur Awards.  The programme was also named runner up for the Supreme Award.

“The People’s Choice Award—and being runner up for the Supreme Award—is another outstanding achievement that is fitting for a programme that could revolutionise the global fishing industry,” says Mr Guy.

The People’s Choice Award, voted by peers, recognises commercial excellence that is both well presented and inspiring.

Alistair Jerrett of Plant and Food Research also won the individual Research Entrepreneur Award for changing the way New Zealand fishes.

“Alistair has made a significant contribution to science and technology based solutions for the seafood industry such as the Precision Seafood Harvesting programme,” says Mr Guy.

The programme is developing new sustainable fishing technology that will allow fish to be landed on fishing boats alive, and in perfect condition, while safely releasing small fish and other species, helping to reduce wastage.

“The potential economic and environmental benefits of this are huge, and it’s no surprise it is attracting so much attention and receiving wider recognition,” says Mr Guy.

Precision Seafood Harvesting is a six year, $52 million project with funding coming from both industry and the Ministry for Primary Industries through the Primary Growth Partnership.

“The Precision Seafood Harvesting programme is a clear example of the innovation that the Primary Growth Partnership is enabling.  It’s about using smart ideas and smart action to deliver smart results," says Mr Guy.

A recent report by NZIER shows that the Primary Growth Partnership could return up to $11.1b to New Zealand's GDP by 2025.
