Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced funding totalling $122,000 for a range of youth organisations with a focus on improving opportunities for young people.

The Ministry of Youth Development funding will support a diverse range of organisations and projects. Recipients are the Far North District Council, the Great Potentials Foundation, the Isolated Communities youth grant fund, the LGBTI youth sector, and the volunteer youth programme for New Zealand Fashion Week.

“I want to see young people across New Zealand have opportunities to develop their confidence and self-management skills, engage in positive activities, connect with their communities, and grow their leadership abilities,” Ms Kaye says.

“The value of such opportunities is that they connect young people with mentors and organisations that will offer guidance, support and encouragement.

“This funding has been allocated across a diverse range of initiatives, from those that help disadvantaged youth to those that provide leadership opportunities for young people in rural communities. Collectively, hundreds of young people from around New Zealand will benefit from it.”

The Ministry of Youth Development provides funding for projects that are initiated and led by young people, those in partnership with territorial authorities, and programmes and services delivered by community-based organisations.
