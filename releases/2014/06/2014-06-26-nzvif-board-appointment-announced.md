Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the reappointment of Anne Blackburn as Deputy Chair of New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Ltd (NZVIF).

“Anne has brought to the NZVIF Board strong business and finance skills, knowledge of banking and investment, together with extensive governance experience in both Crown-owned and private companies,” Mr Joyce says.
