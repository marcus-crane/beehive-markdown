Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has launched an information campaign encouraging people to protect their futures by setting up an enduring power of attorney (EPA).

“The review of the 2007 amendments to the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act found there is a need for clearer information about EPAs, which we’re addressing with a widespread public information campaign,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“An EPA gives a person or people of your choice, known as attorneys, the right to make decisions about your property, care and welfare if you lose the ability to do so yourself.

“The reality is that any of us can lose our ability to make decisions at any time due to illness or injury, so every adult should have an EPA in place.

“An EPA also offers protection against financial abuse, which is reported to be the fastest growing type of elder abuse and neglect.”

The year-long ‘Protect Your Future’ campaign is being run by the Ministry of Social Development’s Office for Senior Citizens and provides clear and straightforward information about the importance of EPAs, how to set one up, and advice on how to make the process cheaper and easier. Information is also available for attorneys.

Throughout the campaign, information will also be developed for legal and health professionals, who play an important role in the EPA process.

“I’m confident that this new information will address the confusion and misinformation about EPAs that was identified in the review, and will result in more New Zealanders protecting their futures with an EPA,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Information and brochures are available now at [www.msd.govt.nz/EPA](http://www.msd.govt.nz/EPA) or at local Citizens Advice Bureaux, public libraries, Community Law Centres and Age Concern offices.
