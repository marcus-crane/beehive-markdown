Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today launched an exciting new phase for Christchurch’s Re:START Mall by opening a new site for the iconic container shops.

“The mall has been a fantastic drawcard for bringing people back into the central city after the closures brought on by the earthquakes,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It’s proven so popular that we wanted to see it continue even as new permanent development ramps up in the new Retail Precinct. That’s why the Government has put up $1.27 million for the relocation, and provided land to accommodate the containers moving from the northern side of the former mall set-up.”

The new mall area opened by Mr Brownlee and the Re:START the Heart Trust today is on a combination of Crown-owned and private land in the area of the Retail Precinct bounded by Oxford Terrace, Cashel Street, Plymouth Lane and Lichfield Street.

Twenty retailers from the northern side of the mall have moved to allow the $100m retail development by Nick Hunt to progress, and will be able to stay on the new mall site for up to two years.

Re:START the Heart Trust chairman John Suckling says he is thrilled retailers have the opportunity to continue their commitment to the inner city.

“Re:START has always been about providing a temporary solution for retailers until there are permanent premises. This move exemplifies another step in the redevelopment of the central city,’’ Mr Suckling says.

Mr Brownlee today also launched the new Future Christchurch Showcase – an attraction in the new mall area where people can view projects and plans for Christchurch, in 3D and interactive multi-media displays, or have their say on the city’s future.

The attraction accommodated in two freight containers and a connecting atrium will be open 10am to 5pm daily, and will be staffed by Future Christchurch ambassadors to give visitors guidance.

“The showcase is about giving people the chance to follow the rebuild, and be a part of it, as we create an exciting new city,’’ Mr Brownlee says.
