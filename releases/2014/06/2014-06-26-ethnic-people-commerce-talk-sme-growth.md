Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will today address the Wellington Ethnic People in Commerce (EPIC) Conference which focusses on promoting ethnic diversity in business networking. 

Wellington’s EPIC conference follows on from a successful conference in Auckland last month and brings together successful entrepreneurs and business leaders to discuss small and medium enterprise (SME) growth.

“This Government will continue to support initiatives that promote New Zealand’s increased diversity as a positive opportunity and something we can all be proud of,” says Ms Collins.

“Many of New Zealand’s small and medium-sized businesses have reached a tipping point where they must look to overseas markets for continued growth.

“EPIC conferences have a unique focus on creating connections and promoting the performance advantages that New Zealand’s increasing diversity creates for all Kiwi businesses.

“In Wellington, EPIC discussions will also help to highlight the priority sectors of Grow Wellington: high-value manufacturing and services; information and communication technologies; and digital technology.”

Wellington’s EPIC Conference will see Alison Mau as the Master of Ceremonies, Xero Global’s Head of Strategy, Chris Teeling, as the keynote speaker, and a range of successful business leaders on panels.

Media are welcome to attend.
