The Minister for Disability Issues Tariana Turia has congratulated disabled New Zealander Jai Waite on winning the prestigious international Apollo Award for the editing of a documentary about a man with a disability. Jai received the award in Singapore as part of the Broadcast Asia Conference.

“Jai’s achievement is amazing. Although he lives with quadriplegia which has limited his use of his arms and legs, it has not prevented him from working full-time in a job which he obviously loves and which he has excelled at on the international stage,” says Minister Turia.

“I congratulate him on winning this award and for teaching us all that living with disability does not have to limit your participation or success in the community or indeed around the world. Jai is a role model not just for others who are disabled but also for the able bodied,” says Minister Turia.

Jai Waite runs the post-production department for Attitude Pictures Ltd which produces the television programme ‘Attitude’ and has been working there for seven years. He won the editing award for a documentary called ‘Jimmy Wants a Job’ – a true story about a young Auckland man with Asperger’s Syndrome, who desperately wants a job and may have found the perfect opportunity. Jimmy is the son of well-known media commentator Russell Brown.

Jai is also a Paralympic Gold medallist in Wheelchair Rugby and is currently training to become a track wheelchair sprinter. 

“I would also like to congratulate the producers of Attitude Pictures which is in its 10th year of production – it is one of the finest programmes on New Zealand television. It has not only given a voice to those who live with disability, but it has opened the world of those who live with disability to the rest of the community. I would also like to thank Jimmy for allowing a documentary to be made about his inspirational story. It is stories such as these that remind us all that those with disability have a right to live a full life, to work, to socialise and to participate in the community just like everyone else. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou katoa.”
