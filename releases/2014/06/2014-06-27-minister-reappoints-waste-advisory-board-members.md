Environment Minister Amy Adams has reappointed two members to the Waste Advisory Board.

Sheryl Stivens and Gareth James have been reappointed to the Board for a term of three years.

“Ms Stivens and Mr James have a high level of expertise and credibility on waste issues. Reappointing them to the Board will provide stability and consistency of advice in a period when significant waste issues are being discussed, such as the possibility of mandatory product stewardship,” Ms Adams says.

Ms Stivens is a self-employed contractor involved in the development of industry training and assessment for the resource recovery industry.

She has previously been on the Executive Board of Recycling Operators of New Zealand and was the General Manager of the WasteBusters Trust Canterbury.

Ms Stivens was a founding member of the Community Recycling Network and has been on the Waste Advisory Board since it was established in 2008.

Mr James is the General Manager of Transpacific Waste Management and is an engineer with more than 30 years’ experience in the waste industry.

He has an in-depth understanding of the mechanics of the waste disposal levy, 14 years’ experience within local government and has been a Board member since 2011.

The Board provides advice to the Environment Minister on issues relating to waste management and waste minimisation.
