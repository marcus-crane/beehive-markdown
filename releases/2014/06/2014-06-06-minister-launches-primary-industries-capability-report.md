Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy today launched *The Future capability needs for the primary industries in New Zealand* - a report that forecasts the future workforce needs of the primary sector.

“The report highlights that employment in the primary industries is expected to increase by 50,000 by 2025 to reach the Government’s goal of an export double. Over half of these workers will need a Tertiary or Level 4 Qualification,” says Mr Guy.

“New Zealand has a proud tradition in the primary industries - it’s an innovative sector that requires our best and brightest across a range of skills. As international markets become more sophisticated and competitive, it is crucial New Zealand’s primary industries keep pace.

“This report is a great snapshot of the future skills that will be required across the sector. It’s now up to industry and Government to continue working together to attract, train and retain competent, qualified people to work in our primary industries.

“There’s good capacity in our tertiary education system to meet this need. The challenge for all of us is to inspire more young people to obtain good qualifications and work in the sector.

“The new primary sector vocational pathway at senior secondary level, the new combined primary sector ITO, the EPIC challenge, and dedicated primary sector institutions like Lincoln, Massey, Taratahi and Telford will all play a part alongside the industry in achieving this.

“We also have many opportunities, such as the National Fieldays, for industry to showcase itself and entice the next robotic engineer, food scientist or silviculturist into the engine room of New Zealand’s economy,” says Mr Guy.

The report also finds that primary industries will remain a major source of employment, especially in the regions. In some regions, such as Gisborne, Tasman, Marlborough and Southland, they account for nearly one in every three jobs.

“I would like to acknowledge the role and support of DairyNZ and Beef + Lamb in the development of this report. It is a good example of how Government and industry can work together to support the growth of the sector and promote it to the next generation,” says Mr Guy.

The report was funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, DairyNZ, and Beef + Lamb New Zealand with support from primary industry representatives.
