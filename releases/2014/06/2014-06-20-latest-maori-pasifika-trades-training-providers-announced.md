The latest five groups selected for the Māori and Pasifika Trades Training initiative were today announced by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Associate Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Tariana Turia.

The joint initiative by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Tertiary Education Commission will fund 3,000 places by 2015 to encourage young Māori and Pasifika people to gain qualifications, New Zealand apprenticeships and employment.

“The Government is investing $43 million in the Māori and Pasifika Trades Training initiative to help young people to develop skills in trades that are needed right now and in the longer term,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand’s economy is now growing strongly and there are big opportunities over the next few years - particularly with the need for housing and infrastructure in Auckland, and the Christchurch rebuild – for anyone interested in trades careers to train and take up apprenticeships.”

“By bringing iwi, hapū, Māori and Pasifika groups together with community, business and tertiary education organisations, this initiative is a unique way of supporting Māori and Pasifika young people while also strengthening our local communities,” Mrs Turia says.   

“This training is an opportunity for Māori and Pasifika to play a larger role in self-determining their destiny and is a way to pursue a trades career, gain vital foundation skills and access a pathway to employment and an apprenticeship.”

The latest five groups, or consortia, chosen are in negotiation with MBIE and TEC to finalise their funding contracts. All of the consortia announced include employers, Māori and/or Pasifika organisations, and tertiary education organisations. The consortia are led by:

- Te Matarau Education Trust and Northland Polytechnic (Te Tai Tokerau Māori and Pasifika Trades Training in Northland, focused on building, and primary industries)
- Auckland Council (The Southern Initiative Māori and Pasifika Trades Training, in South Auckland, focused on infrastructure trades)
- Unitec, Manukau Institute of Technology and Te Wānanga o Aotearoa (the Auckland Māori and Pacific Trades Initiative, focused on construction and infrastructure trades)
- Waiariki Institute of Technology (Waiariki Māori and Pasifika Trades Training in Rotorua, focused on carpentry)
- Te Rūnanganui o Ngāti Porou (Te Toka Initiative on the East Coast, focused on carpentry, agriculture and forestry)

Earlier this year, contracts were signed with seven consortia to provide trades training in the Hawke’s Bay, the East Coast, Waikato, Wellington and Canterbury.

“The majority of these courses are underway and I am expecting the latest five consortia to begin their courses in the coming months,” Mr Joyce says.

The aim of the Māori and Pasifika Trades Training initiative is to enable more Māori and Pasifika learners, aged 18-34, to obtain trades apprenticeships and qualifications that lead to skilled and sustainable employment.
