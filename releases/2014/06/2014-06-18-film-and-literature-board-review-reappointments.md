Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced the reappointment of Clare O’Leary, Michael Stephens and Eileen Swan as members of the Film and Literature Board of Review, for new one-year terms.

“The reappointments will maintain the Board’s diverse range of film, art, law and psychology expertise. As incumbent members, Ms O’Leary, Mr Stephens and Ms Swan have a valuable understanding of New Zealand’s classification system”, says Mr Dunne.

The Film and Literature Board of Review is an independent statutory appeal body. Its purpose is to review the classification of publications referred to it under the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993, after the Office of Film and Literature Classification has classified that publication.
