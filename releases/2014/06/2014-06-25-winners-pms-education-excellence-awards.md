Education Minister Hekia Parata says the winners of the inaugural Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards demonstrate the amazing work being done to give young New Zealanders better educational outcomes and more promising futures.

Finalists, representing early childhood, primary, secondary and secondary-tertiary partnerships, gathered at Te Papa where Prime Minister John Key presented awards to the winners.

Ms Parata says the awards are the opportunity to recognise, celebrate and share the highly effective and innovative practice happening across the education system.

"These awards show the wonderful work being done every day by teachers, principals, trustees, education leaders and communities in classrooms and centres around the country.

"The focus is on groups, teams and partnerships and that’s exactly the kind of collaboration we need to help kids do better. It’s been fantastic to hear how the finalists have worked together to raise the achievement of our children and young people.

"I want to congratulate our winners, and to acknowledge the other 147 groups who submitted entries. They represent the commitment, dedication, energy, imagination, talents and skills of people who every day are making a difference for kiwi kids.”

A panel of education experts reviewed the entries and recommended the finalists across the five categories. Members of the judging panel then visited each of the finalists in order to determine the winning entries, as well as a supreme winner.

"We have had the time and expertise of people of the highest calibre, and I want to thank them for the very substantial and detailed work they have done. They have had a very high standard of entries to decide between,” Ms Parata says.
