Safekids Aotearoa has unveiled a new online tool to help health professionals treat children who have swallowed button batteries.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the tool, which has been developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health, provides doctors and nurses with immediate diagnosis and treatment information.

“If a child swallows a battery it’s important they receive prompt care. Button batteries can get stuck in the throat, nose or ear canal which can have very serious consequences,” says Mr Ryall.

The tool, which can be accessed from smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices, has been launched this week as part of the OECD International Awareness Week in Button Battery Safety.

Consumer Affairs Minister Craig Foss says button batteries can be found in a large number of everyday devices including remote controls, calculators, bathroom scales, reading lights and even singing books and greeting cards.

“Many parents may not realise the damage button batteries can cause. The online tool also includes information for parents on how to keep their children safe and what to do if they suspect their child has swallowed a battery,” says Mr Foss.
