Associate Minister of Health Tariana Turia has announced that applications for funding under the 2014 - 2016 Māori Provider Development Scheme (MPDS) are now open.

“This is an important scheme that works to increase the capacity and capability of Māori providers to deliver effective health and disability services for Māori. It also supports activities to develop a highly-skilled Māori health workforce,” says Minister Turia.

“This scheme can assist providers to improve their infrastructure, achieve service integration, improve the quality of services, and develop workforce skills.”

MPDS Grant funding is available for allocation through four funding streams.

They are:

- Māori health and disability providers

<!--THE END-->

- National Māori health providers

<!--THE END-->

- National Māori disability providers

<!--THE END-->

- Hauora Māori scholarships

“Eligible applicants include an existing Māori health provider that has one or more contracts with the Ministry of Health and/or DHB and/or primary health organisation (PHO) or a Māori health provider that is in the process of developing a contract with the support of the Ministry of Health and/or DHB and/or PHO,” says Minister Turia.

The Purchasing Intentions 2014 - 16, released on the Ministry website, indicates how available funds will be allocated across the four funding streams. 

The Māori Provider Capacity Assessment Tool (MPCAT) introduced in 2012/13 will continue to be used as a framework for measuring growth in organisational capacity over the term of the next funding contract.

**Applications close at 12 noon, on July 30, 2014.**

Application forms and guidelines are available from the Ministry of Health website.
