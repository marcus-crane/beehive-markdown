The Crown has signed an Agreement in Principle to settle historical Treaty of Waitangi claims with the iwi and hapū of Te Wairoa, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Te Wairoa includes seven iwi and hapū clusters covering northern Hawke’s Bay and southern Gisborne and the township of Wairoa, Lake Waikaremoana and the Mahia peninsula.

The clusters are made up of Ngāti Rākaipaaka, Rongomaiwahine/Ngāi Te Rākatō, the Wairoa Waikaremoana Māori Trust Board, Ngāi Tamaterangi/Hinemanuhiri, Whakakī Nui-ā-Rua and Te Wairoa Tāpokorau Clusters 1 and 2.

Collectively they represent approximately 30,400 people (2013 Census) who all descend from the ancestor Kahungunu and the Tākitimu waka.

“The Agreement in Principle marks the start of the next phase of negotiations with Te Wairoa and represents an important milestone. This agreement provides both the Crown and Te Wairoa with a basis from which we can develop a detailed Deed of Settlement,” Mr Finlayson said.

It outlines a broad settlement package which includes Crown acknowledgements of Treaty of Waitangi breaches and cultural, financial and commercial redress.

The total value of settlement is $100 million. This includes redress of Wharerata and Patunamu Forests, a number of Department of Conservation sites and a social and economic revitalisation strategy in partnership with government agencies.

“The Crown is committed to resolving all historical Treaty grievances and an Agreement in Principle is an important step,” Mr Finlayson said.
