The government’s building programme for new schools is breaking fresh ground by ensuring new schools meet exacting environmental building standards, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“Children are reaping the benefits of learning in classrooms with plenty of natural light and warmth, and featuring energy efficient lighting and heating.

“Additionally, schools with energy efficient lighting and heating benefit from reduced operating costs and long-term maintenance costs,” Ms Kaye says.

Pegasus Bay School north of Christchurch is the first school to generate as much energy as it uses, the result of the installation of solar panels. It opened last week, bringing to 14 the number of state schools in New Zealand that meet Green Star building standards.

“Green Star schools are designed and constructed to use less energy,  maintain high indoor air quality,  encourage water recycling and efficiency, and improve waste management and recycling,” Ms Kaye says.

The 14 schools are:

- Pegasus Bay School and Clearview Primary in Christchurch;
- Hobsonville Point Secondary School, Hobsonville Point Primary School, Stonefields School, Hingaia Peninsula Primary School, Mission Heights School, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Te Kotuku, and Ormiston Senior College in Auckland;
- Kimi Ora Naenae Base School , Amesbury School, and Kapi Mana Special Needs School in Wellington;
- Papamoa College in Tauranga; and
- Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Whangaroa in Northland.

A further four schools opening over the next year will be Green Star rated:

- Halswell School in Christchurch;
- Endeavour Avenue Primary School in Hamilton;
- Ormiston Road Primary School in Auckland; and
- Shotover Primary School in Queenstown.

*Editor's notes:*

**What are the features of Green Star buildings?**

Green schools are designed and constructed to:

- Use less energy in operation through energy-efficient building design
- Demonstrate high indoor air quality leading to improved learning outcomes
- Eliminate toxic materials from places where children learn and play
- Employ day lighting strategies and improved classroom acoustics
- Conserve fresh drinking water and help manage storm water runoff through the use of rainwater collection
- Decrease the burden on municipal water and wastewater treatment through water recycling and water-efficient appliances and fittings
- Encourage waste management efforts and recycling through separation opportunities to reduce demand on local landfills
- Provide interactive environmental education with an emphasis on sustainability and resource
- Reduce maintenance costs in the long run

**What do Green Star building ratings consider?**

Green Star ratings consider a number of environmental attributes, including: energy and water use; materials; indoor environment quality; land use and ecology; emissions; transport; and building management including ease of maintenance.

**Why use an environmental rating tool?**

The rating tool allows the Ministry to determine where its funding will be spent, and provides an independent evaluation of a project’s energy efficiency and sustainability credentials.
