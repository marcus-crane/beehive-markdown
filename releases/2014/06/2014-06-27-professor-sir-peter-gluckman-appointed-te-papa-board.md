Professor Sir Peter Gluckman has been appointed to the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“I am very pleased that Sir Peter will contribute his experience and international standing to Te Papa,” Mr Finlayson said. “This will continue to ensure that the board retains a diverse range of skills and expertise.”

Sir Peter is Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister, and one of New Zealand’s most distinguished scientists. He was the founding Director of the Liggins Institute at the University of Auckland and developed LENScience, a programme enabling schools to connect with scientific research communities.

He is a recipient of New Zealand’s top science award, the Rutherford Medal, and a fellow of The Royal Society of London, the only New Zealander elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science (USA), and the Academy of Medical Sciences of Great Britain.

Te Papa was established under the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Act 1992. Its purpose is to provide a forum in which to present, explore, and preserve the heritage of New Zealand’s cultures and knowledge of the natural environment to better understand and treasure the past, to enrich the present and to meet challenges of the future.

Mr Finlayson thanked Fiona Campbell, who is finishing her term, for her work on the Te Papa board.
