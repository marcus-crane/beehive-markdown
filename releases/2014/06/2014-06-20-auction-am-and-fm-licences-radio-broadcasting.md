Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has today announced more than 100 licences for AM and FM radio broadcasting will be auctioned later this year.

All licences will be auctioned as commercial licences with tenure up to 2031.

A number of the current commercial licences had been allocated temporarily and will expire in September, before the auction takes place.  Transitional arrangements for these licence holders will be advised shortly.

“The auction will provide certainty to broadcasters, and may enable some additional radio broadcasting coverage. The licences to be auctioned are predominantly located outside of main metropolitan areas,” Ms Adams says.

A provisional list of the licences to be auctioned is available at: [http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/policy-and-planning/projects/auction-13-2013-am-and-fm-licences-for-sound-broadcasting](http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/policy-and-planning/projects/auction-13-2013-am-and-fm-licences-for-sound-broadcasting).

A final auction list, along with reserve prices and an auction date will be confirmed in the next few months.

Parties interested in purchasing a licence that is not currently on the auction list, can advise the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment by emailing [radiospectrum@mbie.govt.nz](mailto:radiospectrum@mbie.govt.nz).
