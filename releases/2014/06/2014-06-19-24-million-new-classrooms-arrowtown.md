Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye has announced funding for new classrooms at Arrowtown Primary School, in response to a growing population.

The $2.4 million investment to build six classrooms will provide modern learning environments that are enjoyable to teach in and learn in, Ms Kaye says.

“This Government has a vision for a sustainable network of schools that can accommodate the rapidly growing Queenstown area.

“The Queenstown-Lakes District has experienced a population increase of 22.9% since the 2006 Census. Local schools have had steady roll growth over the past decade, and these new classrooms are part of an expansion of school facilities to accommodate that growth.”

The classrooms are due to open in early 2015, Ms Kaye says, and will be built to the latest learning environment standards that support modern teaching styles and provide a comfortable environment for students.

“They will provide safe, contemporary spaces that will help inspire students to learn.”

The new classrooms at Arrowtown Primary School will increase the resilience of the schooling network in Southland, Ms Kaye says.

Three teaching spaces were recently added to Remarkables Primary School, and construction has begun on a new school at Shotover near Queenstown, which will open in time for the 2015 school year.

Planning is also under way for the relocation of Wakatipu High School by 2018, which will feature more learning spaces.

“The Queenstown Lakes District can be assured that the government is investing to future proof Queenstown for the many young families that want to live there,” says Ms Kaye.
