Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson has rushed to correct New Zealand First leader Winston Peters’ misunderstanding today of a High Court decision issued two weeks ago.

“New Zealand First has reliably supported Treaty settlement legislation in the House this term, despite the rhetoric that many often unfairly associate with Mr Peters,” Mr Finlayson said. “I would not like to see him ruin his record of support for New Zealand’s future because he has simply misread a judgment.”

Mr Peters today referred in a confused manner to the High Court’s decision of late May that declined to make an order for a rehearing of the applicants’ concerns with respect to Te Upokerehe and Ngāti Ruapani groups.

The Court found that while there was a jurisdictional error in Judge Reeves’ decision not to grant an urgent hearing of the groups’ claims in the Waitangi tribunal, the Tribunal was correct in finding there was no substantive unfairness caused by the Crown’s settlement with Ngāi Tuhoe.

“The government believes in just and durable settlement of all historical claims,” Mr Finlayson said. “That is why the positions of groups that are not yet ready to settle are always preserved so they suffer no prejudice.
