The first major school project completed as part of the Government’s $1.137 billion investment in education renewal in greater Christchurch was officially opened by Prime Minister John Key today.

Education Minister Hekia Parata says Pegasus Bay School is another significant step forward, not only for its local community, but for the rest of the greater Christchurch region.

“Education is a significant part of the region’s wider earthquake recovery. While the earthquakes of 2011 left communities facing major challenges, the opening of this school represents their resilience, strength and determination.

“This school is a great investment for the kids currently at the school and all those who’ll follow over many years to come.”

Ms Parata says Pegasus Bay School was completed on time and on budget and it showcases the best of Kiwi construction and design. It is also New Zealand’s first net zero energy school.

“All the teaching spaces are modern learning environments, which contribute to the wider drive we’re making to lift the educational achievement of kids. The original school was founded in 1873 –what we see today is clearly a far cry from what those first students could ever have dreamed of.”

The first stage of Pegasus Bay School consists of a library, administration, resourcing and hall, and teaching areas for 420 children. The second stage will provide two teaching blocks for another 180 students, and that work will start once the current school reaches capacity.

**Editor's notes:**

***Construction Details:***

- Pegasus Bay School is being constructed in two stages.
  
  The first stage is completed and consists of library; administration; resourcing, and hall, initial teaching area (19 teaching spaces) for 420 students.
  
  Stage Two will provide a further two teaching blocks for an additional 180 students. It will be built once  the school is at capacity with future growth projected.
- The total cost for the build includes $0.653 million for furniture and equipment and ICT.
- The Stage One construction budget is $14.945m, including $0.481m for furniture and equipment and ICT.
- The design team was headed by Jasmax and the main contractor was Arrow International Limited. The Ministry’s project manager is Aurecon.

***Net zero energy school:***

- Pegasus Bay School is the first school in New Zealand which has been designed as a net zero energy school.
- A net zero energy school is one which is designed to make as much energy as it uses. Its use of solar panels means it will be almost entirely self-sufficient in energy use.
- It is a five star energy-saving building and will be a model for other school construction projects in New Zealand.
- The school has 557.8sqm of solar electric panels located on the roof.
- The school will produce and use 110,000kW/h a year (36kwph per sqm). This means it will use approximately 75% less energy than a non-5 star school (which uses 80-100kwph per sqm).
- The estimated annual saving for the school is approximately $15,400
- The payback period of the solar electric = approximately 15 years
- It is hoped that students will be able to include elements of the net zero energy concept and the data collected from the system in science, social studies and other learning programs.

***Green Star***

- Pegasus bay is built to the New Zealand Green Building Council’s Green Star Education 5-Star Standard, which is now the Ministry’s policy for all new schools.
- The Ministry requires new schools to follow environmentally sustainable principles for design and construction as assessed by the New Zealand Green Council’s Educational Tool.
- The Green Star – Education 2009 Design and Built rating tool evaluates the environmental initiatives and/or the potential
