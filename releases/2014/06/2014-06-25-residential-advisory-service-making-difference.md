Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says the Residential Advisory Service has assisted thousands of earthquake-hit property owners in Canterbury since its inception a year ago.

The service provides free, independent help to residential property owners who are facing challenges in getting their home repaired or rebuilt following the Canterbury earthquakes.

“It has received more than 5000 calls and emails from people seeking help, and independent advisors have held more than 1000 meetings with property owners to progress their situations.

“The numbers clearly indicate the service is needed, and the experience from the first year will be invaluable in ensuring it can continue delivering outcomes for complex issues,” Ms Wagner says.

Survey results show the Residential Advisory Service is extremely effective, with 84 per cent satisfied or very satisfied, while 96 per cent felt they were listened to and understood.

“The independent advisors are doing a great job of helping people in difficult positions to find a way through their situation,” Ms Wagner says.

The Residential Advisory Service has been gradually expanding since it started to ensure it can reach the most people possible.  It is now available to property owners who are engaged in Earthquake Commission (EQC) complaints.

“We are all mindful we’re getting down to the most complex and hardest cases to resolve, so if we can find a way to adapt the service to ensure those people are adequately advised, we want to make that happen,” Nicky Wagner says.
