Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today announced 500,000 inward transactions have now been processed through the Joint Border Management System.

The Trade Single Window component of the system, which has been developed by Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries, was launched in 2013 for importers and exporters to submit shipment details electronically to a single point of contact, rather than dealing with several government agencies.

“The immediate benefits to industry have been the elimination of data duplication, a reduction in transaction costs and improved response times.

“More than 37 per cent of all inward border transactions and 100% of outward transactions are now processed via Trade Single Window, and more traders are moving to the new platform all the time,” Ms Wagner says.

Fonterra and DHL are the latest importers and exporters to transition to it.

On average transactions through Trade Single Window are processed in under 30 seconds.  Further functionality for the Joint Border Management System will be rolled out this year and next.
