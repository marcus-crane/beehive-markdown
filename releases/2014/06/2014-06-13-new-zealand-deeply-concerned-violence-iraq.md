Foreign Minister Murray McCully has expressed New Zealand’s deep concern about the serious deterioration of security in Iraq in recent days.

“It appears that militants associated with the Islamic State of Levant (ISIL) have taken control of significant parts of Iraq’s second largest city of Mosul, as well as other areas of northwest Iraq,” Mr McCully says.

“We strongly condemn the violence, loss of life, and displacement of Iraqi civilians associated with this action.

“We are also concerned for the well-being of a group of Turkish diplomats and citizens who have been taken hostage.

“New Zealand is supportive of the democratic process in Iraq, including last month’s elections. It will be important for the Iraqi Government to address the significant security challenges that the country is facing.

“As a United Nations-listed terrorist organisation, ISIL is treated as a designated terrorist entity for the purposes of New Zealand law,” Mr McCully said.
