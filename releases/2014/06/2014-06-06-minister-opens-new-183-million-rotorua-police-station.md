Police Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Rotorua Police station and Bay of Plenty District headquarters.

The new building, costing $18.3 million, is the sixteenth new Police station to open since the start of 2009, with a total cost across all of the projects of $145 million.

“This new station represents a significant investment in the Rotorua area and is a great new asset for Police and local communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It was an honour to officially open the new building, and to meet the hard-working staff who now have a modern, state of the art facility from which to serve the public.

“I was also able to congratulate Bay of Plenty Police staff for their excellent results, with recorded crimes down 7.4 per cent last year in the district, on top of a 7.1 per cent reduction in 2012.

“I want to thank everyone involved in the design and construction of this building, and wish staff a safe and successful future in their new station.”
