Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy today announced a new study to evaluate opportunities for increasing investment, employment and incomes in the Bay of Plenty.

The Bay of Plenty Regional Growth Study, commissioned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry for Primary Industries, will build on work under way in the region including the Bay of Connections Strategy, the Regional Economic Activity Report’s regional profile, and investment through the Government’s Primary Growth Partnership. 

“The Government is committed to helping all of our regions attract investment and create more and higher-paying jobs,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Business Growth Agenda contains more than 350 initiatives to encourage growth and investment in New Zealand, many of which are directly benefiting the Bay of Plenty region. For example, the Government’s investment in ultra-fast broadband is enabling people and businesses to more efficiently connect with each other and the global marketplace.”

The new Regional Growth Study will highlight further economic opportunities for the Bay of Plenty by bringing together knowledge held by local businesspeople, iwi, stakeholders, and economic development agencies, with official data and independent economic analysis.

Mr Guy says the report will build on work already started by MPI to unlock the potential for growth in the Bay of Plenty’s primary sector.

“There have already been great successes in the kiwifruit industry and in Māori agribusiness in the Bay of Plenty,” Mr Guy says.

“More than two-thirds of the avocado industry is based in the region and will benefit from the recently announced $8.5 million NZ Avocados Go Global Primary Growth Partnership initiative — a five-year programme to increase the productivity and capability within the avocado industry.

“Building on these initiatives, the Study will investigate opportunities for investment and growth in other sectors such as the forestry, horticulture and value-added wood processing and specialist manufacturing sectors, to lift incomes and employment in the region.”

The Bay of Plenty Regional Growth Study is the third in an ongoing in-depth series focusing on economic development in key regional economies. The first study, for the Gisborne/Hawke’s Bay region, was released recently. The second, for the Northland region, was issued for tender in April.
