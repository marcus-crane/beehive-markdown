Foreign Minister Murray McCully is travelling to the United States, Ghana, Turkey, Iran, Serbia, Belgium and the Dominican Republic over the next two weeks.

The Minister is travelling to Washington to attend the ‘Our Oceans’ conference, which is being hosted by US Secretary of State John Kerry. He will also visit New York, at the same time as the Prime Minister, in support of New Zealand’s United Nations Security Council campaign.

“The ‘Our Oceans’ conference is an opportunity for New Zealand and the United States to address some of the critical issues the world’s oceans face, such as over-fishing and marine pollution,” Mr McCully says.

We are very pleased Secretary of State Kerry invited New Zealand to attend this event, given the importance of oceans to the New Zealand economy and the role we play supporting Pacific Island countries with fisheries and maritime issues.

“I look forward to supporting the Prime Minister’s engagements in New York and carrying out further work in support of our United Nations Security Council campaign while off-shore,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully will also travel to Ghana, Turkey, Iran, Serbia, Belgium and the Dominican Republic where he will attend the Central American Integration System Summit.
