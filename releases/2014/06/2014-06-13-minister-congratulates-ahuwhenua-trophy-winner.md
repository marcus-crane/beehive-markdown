Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has tonight congratulated Te Rua O Te Moko Ltd, the winner of the 2014 Ahuwhenua Trophy Māori Excellence in Farming Award.

“There was a real buzz at the event in Tauranga which attracted 900 tonight. I take my hat off to Te Rua O Te Moko, and to the other two finalists this year; each one is an exemplar for rural economic development,” says Mr Guy.

“As a Trustee of the Ahuwhenua Trophy competition, I’m excited to support, acknowledge and celebrate the significant role Māori play in New Zealand’s primary industries.

“Māori agribusiness is a major contributor to New Zealand’s primary sector, and the wider New Zealand economy. The innovation of these finalists in pulling smaller land holdings into larger, more commercially effective dairy farms are great examples for wider Māori agribusiness development.

“Last year, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) released a report that estimated lifting productivity on over 1 million hectares of Māori freehold land to average industry benchmarks could result in an additional $8 billion in gross output, and 3,600 new jobs for the primary sector.

“The Ahuwhenua Trophy showcases farms delivering the sort of outcomes that other Maori land owners should aspire to.

“The Government is committed to working with Māori to grow the sustainable productivity of their primary sector assets, and continue to increase rural economic development,” says Mr Guy.

The winner of the young Māori Farmer Award went to Wiremu Reid, a lower order sharemilker from Winton.

“I would like to congratulate all farmers involved in this year’s competition and I look forward to seeing more examples of Māori farmers striving to achieve excellence, and the continued growth of Māori agribusiness,” says Mr Guy.
