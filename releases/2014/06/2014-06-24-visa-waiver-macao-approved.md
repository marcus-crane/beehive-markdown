Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced that nationals of Macao Special Administrative Region of China (Macao) will no longer need a visitor visa to travel to New Zealand for a short visit.

“The visa waiver will make it easier for Macao nationals to come to New Zealand, which will create opportunities for business, cultural and social exchanges,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“This agreement recognises the growing engagement between New Zealand and Macao.

“Macao’s growing business and tourism sectors present potential opportunities for New Zealand to develop export markets in food and beverages.’’

The visa waiver will come into force on 30 June 2014. Currently around 240 Macanese visit New Zealand per year and tourism is expected to grow with the visa waiver in place.

New Zealand visitors already enjoy visa free access to Macao with around 14,000 New Zealanders travelling to Macao each year.
