Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has acknowledged the high volume of traffic to the new ‘rural’ section on the National Depression Initiative (NDI) website.

Farmers’ stories about overcoming depression were added to the NDI website in April to encourage rural people to recognise and seek help for depression.

“There’s clearly an appetite for this information. Since the videos and written stories were added nearly 12,200 people have visited the website,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The web traffic has come from across the country. The average length of visits to the page indicates that visitors are viewing at least one of the three videos.

“Rural depression is an important issue, so it’s encouraging that so many people are turning to the information and self-help tools that are available on the website,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The personal stories from rural New Zealanders discussing their experiences are clearly resonating with other farmers.

“Rural communities are known for being close knit and supportive. As the farming community comes together at Fieldays over the next few days, I encourage those who need support to take the opportunity to reach out and ask for help.”

The written stories and videos from rural men and women who have been affected by depression along with self-help tools can be found at [www.depression.org.nz/rural](http://www.depression.org.nz/rural)
