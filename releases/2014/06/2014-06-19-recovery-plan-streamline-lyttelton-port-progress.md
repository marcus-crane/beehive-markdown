Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says he is using the powers of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 to allow for timelier redevelopment of the badly damaged Lyttelton Port.

“Under the CER Act I have today directed Environment Canterbury and Lyttelton Port Company to prepare a Lyttelton Port Recovery Plan,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Lyttelton Port needs certainty about repairing, rebuilding and reconfiguring its operations, and this plan will deliver that.

“The port is the major gateway to the South Island for goods freighted by sea and it makes a significant contribution to the regional and national economy.

“Creating a Recovery Plan provides for the social, economic, cultural and environmental wellbeing of the Lyttelton and greater Christchurch communities.”   

The plan will ensure safe, efficient and effective operations, while taking account of the impact on the coastal marine area and the community, any implications on transport and the needs of users of the port and its surrounding areas.

“I know the people of Lyttelton are passionate about their township and the community and port users need to be involved in the preparation of this plan.

“Lyttelton Port Company and Environment Canterbury will be required to consult with those groups and the public as the plan is developed.

“There have been no decisions made on how the port should be redeveloped, but I have determined that a Recovery Plan is the best tool for timely redevelopment to be achieved.

“A Recovery Plan allows for a streamlined process and will see redevelopment occur in a timelier manner than under the Resource Management Act, while still ensuring robust testing of information.

“This is a similar process to the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan and the Land Use Recovery Plan,” Mr Brownlee says.

Under today’s direction Lyttelton Port Company will undertake consultation and provide ECan with the initial information required.  ECan will then develop a preliminary draft, call for written comment and hold a hearing.  It is expected the draft Recovery Plan will be provided to the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery in July 2015.

“The plan will provide very clear guidance about how the port can be repaired and rebuilt, in a manner that works best for the Lyttelton area,” Mr Brownlee says.
