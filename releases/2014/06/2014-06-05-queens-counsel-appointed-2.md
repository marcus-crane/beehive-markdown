Fourteen lawyers have been appointed Queen’s Counsel this year, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC announced today.

The newly appointed silks are:

**Auckland** - Russell Bartlett, Stephen Bonnar, Paul David, Marie Dyhrberg, Antonia Fisher, Paul Rishworth, Paul Wicks

**Christchurch** - Prudence Steven, Peter Whiteside

**Dunedin** - Anita Chan

**Wellington** - David Laurenson, Matthew McClelland, Matthew Palmer, Paul Radich.

“The Queen’s Counsel rank recognizes independent advocates who have excelled at the highest level of law,” Mr Finlayson said. “I am pleased to be able to announce the newest silks to be admitted to the inner bar.”

“I am also pleased a third of the appointments are women. I am aware there are very talented women in the profession who remain reticent about putting their names forward and I hope to see increasing numbers represented in the future.”

“Note the appointment of Paul Rishworth, who has been appointed under the Royal prerogative in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to the law,” Mr Finlayson said. “This follows last year’s appointment of his colleague Peter Watts QC and confirms the University of Auckland’s reputation as a centre of excellence for public law.”
