Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes two defence arrangements with France and South Korea which were signed at Shangri-La Dialogue.

“It is important to develop our practical co-operation, and to strengthen our relationships with a range of defence partners,” says Dr Coleman.

Dr Coleman and French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a Status of Forces Agreement on defence co-operation. It provides a framework for existing and future defence engagement activities, including exercises and training.

“I welcome the Status of Forces Agreement between New Zealand and France, which facilitates closer co-operation between our two defence forces,” says Dr Coleman.

“France is an important partner for New Zealand in the Pacific. We share a common concern for stability and security in the region, and we co-operate on maritime surveillance and humanitarian and disaster relief. We look forward to building on our relationship in the future.”

Dr Coleman and South Korean Defence Minister Kim Kwan-jin signed a Memorandum of Arrangement on defence co-operation.

“I was pleased to sign a Memorandum of Arrangement with the Republic of Korea, which formalises existing defence co-operation and provides a framework for undertaking new engagement activities in areas of mutual interest,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand has a long history of involvement with the Republic of Korea, dating back to the Korean War. We continue to support regional efforts to bring peace and security to the Korean peninsula through our contribution to the UN Command Military Armistice Commission mission.”

Following Shangri-La Dialogue, Dr Coleman is today attending the Five Power Defence Arrangements Defence Ministers’ Meeting in Malaysia.

“The Five Power Defence Arrangements meeting is a good opportunity for New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and the UK to build upon our engagement at Shangri-La Dialogue, and to set the priorities for security co-operation in the region,” says Dr Coleman.
