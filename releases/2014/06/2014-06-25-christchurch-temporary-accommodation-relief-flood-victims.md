Canterbury residents impacted by recent flooding will now be eligible to apply for funding through the Government’s Temporary Accommodation Assistance (TAA) programme, it has been confirmed today.

“While analysis is yet to determine the extent to which flooding is related to earthquake issues, it is clear that some residents would not have suffered the severity of flooding they had if the earthquakes had not occurred,” Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“The Government is focused on getting Christchurch back on track as soon as possible. Helping residents who are facing accommodation difficulties in the short term is part of that commitment.

“Those who have received letters from the Earthquake Commission confirming they have Increased Flooding Vulnerability are eligible to apply for assistance under the TAA.

“Applicants will also need to satisfy other criteria in line with TAA criteria, including the requirement to vacate their homes and to have exhausted any insurance support for temporary accommodation,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The TAA will continue to be administered by the Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service (CETAS) and applicants should contact CETAS in the first instance”.

“The recent flooding in Christchurch has compounded the difficulties some residents are already facing due to the earthquakes. Today’s announcement confirms that help is available,” says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“TAA will help ease short term accommodation issues for flood victims as they work to rebuild their lives,” Mr Brownlee says. 

Mayor Lianne Dalziel is delighted with the announcement that flood-affected residents will be eligible to apply for temporary accommodation assistance.

“I’m grateful that the Government has responded positively to the Council’s request to help these residents.

“CETAS has already provided support and assistance to many earthquake affected residents and today’s news will see this valuable support extended.

“I know this announcement will bring much-needed relief to a significant number of people in flood-affected areas,” Ms Dalziel says.
