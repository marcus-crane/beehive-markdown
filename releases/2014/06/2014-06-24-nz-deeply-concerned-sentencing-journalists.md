Foreign Minister Murray McCully has expressed deep concern at the prison sentences imposed by the Egyptian court on three Al Jazeera journalists, including Australian Peter Greste. 

“Press freedom and transparent judicial processes are fundamental to any democracy,” Mr McCully says.

“I have seen nothing to suggest that these three journalists were doing anything other than their job and the seven year prison sentences imposed appear to be aimed at silencing critics rather than serving justice.

“The Egyptian authorities need to understand that the international community is watching closely and will not accept the current verdicts.

“The Egyptian authorities should review this case as a matter of urgency,” Mr McCully says.
