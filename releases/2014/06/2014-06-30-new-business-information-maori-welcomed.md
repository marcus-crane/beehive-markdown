Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner has welcomed the release of new statistics today on Māori businesses that will provide vital information to the sector.

Tatauranga Umanga Māori is the first official release of Māori business statistics, and provides information on the contribution Māori authorities’ businesses make to the economy.

“Tatauranga Umanga Māori provides a meaningful platform for ongoing discussion and debate amongst the government, business and Māori sector about respective approaches to measuring Māori economic development,” Ms Wagner says.

The report concentrates on easily identifiable Māori authorities which are a sub set of Māori businesses.  Statistics New Zealand has a longer-term goal of being able to identify all Māori businesses so that richer information can be provided about the contribution they make to the economy.

“My department is strongly focused on making sure New Zealand has the information it needs to grow and prosper, and meeting the information needs of Māori is a key part of this,” Ms Wagner says.
