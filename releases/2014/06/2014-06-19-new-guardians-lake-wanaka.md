Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced the appointment of three new Guardians of Lake Wanaka and the reappointment of three other members.

“The Guardians of Lake Wanaka play an important oversight role in the preservation of Lake Wanaka, which is one of the few southern lakes with an unmodified shoreline,” Dr Smith says.

“The lake is protected by special legislation that provides the Guardians with a watchdog role to ensure that the lake and its shoreline remain unspoilt for the enjoyment of future generations.”

The Guardians of Lake Wanaka are empowered under the Lake Wanaka Preservation Act 1973 to report and make recommendations to the Minister of Conservation.

The newly-appointed members are John Darby, Don Robertson and Alan Cone. The re-appointed members are Helen Tail, Barrie Wills and Taare Bradshaw.

All six members have been appointed for a term of three years. The chairperson is yet to be appointed.
