Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today grants of $4.1 million to three museum projects around New Zealand in Akaroa, the Chatham Islands and Waitangi.

Christchurch City Council will receive a grant of $500,000 towards the earthquake recovery and rejuvenation project at Akaroa Museum. This project is on the Council’s list of its Top 30 projects requiring earthquake repair and strengthening.

Most of Akaroa Museum remains closed to staff and the public after engineering assessments found it to be below 34% of the New Building Standards. This project will help tourism in Canterbury, as over 150,000 tourists arrive in Akaroa on cruise ships each year.

The Chatham Islands Council will receive $1,076,000 towards the construction of a purpose-built Chatham Islands Museum. The Museum’s collections will cover the history of Moriori, Māori and European settlement, as well as maritime history and the unique flora and fauna of the region. 

“The Chatham Islands have a unique and significant history,” Mr Finlayson said.  “This museum will enable Chatham Islanders to come together and proudly celebrate their heritage, and also to care for and display their important treasures.”

The Waitangi National Trust will receive $2,538,000 towards the building of a Museum of Waitangi. Government funding is being granted to assist the Trust to build a museum which can meet the needs and importance of the taonga to be displayed there. The museum will represent the stories and heritage of Waitangi, and the origins of our nation. 

“The Museum of Waitangi will be a pivotal component of the major redevelopment at the Treaty Grounds which is being done to coincide with the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty,” Mr Finlayson said.
