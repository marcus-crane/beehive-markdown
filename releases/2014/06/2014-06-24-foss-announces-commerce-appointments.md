Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced appointments to the Testing Laboratory Registration Council, Standards Council and board of the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ).

Paul Connell has been appointed Chair of the Testing Laboratory Registration Council, while Lindsey Lawton, Howard Duff and John Boshier have been appointed as members. Mr Boshier has also been appointed as a member of the Standards Council.

“Mr Connell has excellent financial literacy and management experience and I am confident he will be well supported by the other appointees,” Mr Foss says.

The Testing Laboratory Registration Council is responsible for accrediting testing and calibration laboratories and inspection bodies.

The Standards Council is a Crown entity responsible for the development and approval of New Zealand Standards across a range of products, processes and services.

Mike Willing has been appointed Chair of the JAS-ANZ Board, having been a member since 2004.

Denise Bowen has been reappointed as a member for a second term and Rosie Byford has been appointed as a first-time member.

“Mr Willing has a decade of experience on the JAS-ANZ Board, including terms as Vice-Chair and Chair. I am confident he will again draw on his considerable expertise in quality management systems to be a competent leader,” Mr Foss says.

JAS-ANZ aligns trans-Tasman trade accreditation and certification and assists exporters seeking to gain international recognition. New Zealand can appoint three members to the board, sitting alongside six Australian appointments and the Chief Executive.

All appointments to the Testing Laboratory Registration Council are for a term of three years. Mr Boshier’s appointment to the Standards Council is for one year. JAS-ANZ appointments run until the end of 2016.
