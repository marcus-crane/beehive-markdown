Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the 2014 Defence Capability Plan shows good progress has been made on modernising NZDF capabilities.

“The 2014 Defence Capability Plan describes the new equipment and assets that the NZDF will purchase over the next decade. It resets capability and investment priorities, and focuses on the NZDF’s ability to deliver joint operations, and grow combat and support capabilities,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is vital that the NZDF has well trained personnel with the right equipment to deliver on the Government’s expectations. The Government is committed to investing in the NZDF’s capabilities by upgrading equipment and developing its workforce. A number of significant capability investments have been made in the past year, and further investment is planned.

“While defence funding has increased, stringent management must continue. The NZDF is committed to making ongoing savings and efficiencies as part of its future planning. This is crucial for the NZDF to sustain its capability.”

Over the past year the Government has purchased over $600 million of new capability including Navy helicopters, Army trucks and a pilot training package. Contracts were recently awarded to upgrade the Navy frigates’ combat systems, and to construct the new NZSAS battle training facility. Cabinet will shortly decide on a replacement for the Navy’s tanker.

The Defence Capability Plan also signals opportunities for New Zealand’s defence industry. The Government is committed to ensuring opportunities for involving local industry are fully canvassed before major decisions are made.
