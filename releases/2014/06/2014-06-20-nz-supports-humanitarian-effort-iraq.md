Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will provide $500,000 to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help people displaced by fighting in Iraq.

“New Zealand is deeply concerned by the escalating violence in Iraq and the displacement of civilians,” Mr McCully says.

“An estimated 500,000 people have been forced from their homes in recent days due to advances by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

“There are now one million internally displaced people in Iraq and 350,000 Syrian refugees who have fled the civil war in their own country.

“These numbers could rise rapidly if the security situation continues to deteriorate.

“New Zealand is committed to the international humanitarian effort and we will work with UNHCR to support those forced from their homes in Mosul.

“Our contribution will help UNHCR deliver urgently needed supplies such as family tents, mattresses, blankets, hygiene kits and water containers,” Mr McCully said.
