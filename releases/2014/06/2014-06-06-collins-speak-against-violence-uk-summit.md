Justice Minister Judith Collins leaves for the United Kingdom this weekend to represent New Zealand at the world’s largest international gathering to help end sexual violence in conflict.

The Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, to be held in London 10-13 June, aims to create global momentum towards ending rape and sexual violence in conflict by delivering practical agreements among nations.

Ms Collins says sexual violence is an abhorrent crime that perpetuates conflict and instability.

“New Zealand strongly supports initiatives to eliminate sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, including in our Australasian region,” Ms Collins says.

“It’s heartening to see over 140 nations endorsing the United Nation’s Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict and supporting ongoing discussions at this high level.”

More than 70 Ministers from around the world will attend the Summit. It will be co-chaired by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and Special Envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Angelina Jolie.

Sessions will look in detail at a range of sexual violence in conflict issues, discuss challenges and recommendations for future action, and build a global consensus on how to address ending sexual violence in conflict.     

Ms Collins will highlight New Zealand’s work to prevent sexual violence and improve women’s participation in addressing peace and security within the Pacific.
