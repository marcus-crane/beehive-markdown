Prime Minister John Key has welcomed today’s release of statistics that show two-way trade with China has exceeded $20 billion on an annual basis for the first time.  

“In 2010, two-way trade was worth $10 billion; and our exports to China were $4 billion. At that time, the then-Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and I agreed on the ambitious target of doubling two-way trade to $20 billion by 2015,” says Mr Key.

Statistics out today show that New Zealand is now exporting more than $11 billion worth of products to China, and two-way trade has already surpassed the goal of $20 billion. 

Mr Key says; “The growth is showing no signs of slowing and that is why in my visit to Beijing in March, President Xi Jinping and I set an ambitious new goal for trade. We are now aiming to reach two-way trade of $30 billion by 2020.”

New Zealand’s economic relationship with China has deepened markedly in recent years.

“We have seen rapidly escalating demand from China as people have become wealthier, and naturally turn to higher quality products.   As a high quality food producer, New Zealand is well placed to help meet that demand.

“This Government is committed to ensuring we have the right resources in place to support this growth and recognise the ever-increasing importance of the China market.

“That is why we have recently increased our personnel working on the China relationship, both in China and back in New Zealand.

“The New Zealand government and Kiwi exporters are committed to continuing to improve our relationship with China, because it creates jobs and increases incomes.

“Reaching the $20 billion target ahead of schedule shows that our investment in this market is paying dividends.”
