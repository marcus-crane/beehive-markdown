Waikato-based company director Tania Simpson has been appointed to the board of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Finance Minister Bill English says.

Ms Simpson is of Tainui, Ngāi Tahu and Ngāpuhi descent, and is the founding director of Māori policy advisory firm Kōwhai Consulting Ltd.  She is currently a director of Mighty River Power Ltd, AgResearch Ltd and is also a member of the Waitangi Tribunal.  She will shortly retire as a director of Landcare Research. 

“The Reserve Bank board will benefit from Ms Simpson’s strong governance background across a range of sectors, and her deep understanding of the Māori economy,” Mr English says. 

“I am pleased a director of Ms Simpson’s calibre has made herself available to serve on the board and I am confident she will add value to the bank’s work.”

Ms Simpson fills the vacancy left by Sue Sheldon’s retirement earlier in 2014.

Mr English also confirmed the reappointment of Wellington-based company director Keith Taylor for a second term as a director of the bank. Mr Taylor is currently chair of the Government Superannuation Fund and a commissioner on the Earthquake Commission board.
