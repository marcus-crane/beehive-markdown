Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says new figures released today show primary sector exports will reach record levels of $37.7b over the last year - around $1.3b more than previously forecast.

The Ministry for Primary Industries today released *Situation and Outlook for Primary Industries 2014 (SOPI 2014) ­*- an annual publication that provides a snapshot and forecast for our major primary sectors over the next four years.

“SOPI 2014 reveals export prices increased across most sectors for the year ending June 2014. Both dairy and forestry sectors stood out with good increases in both price and production,” says Mr Guy.

“Dairy now accounts for 46 percent of total primary industry export value and 35 percent of total New Zealand merchandise export value. High price levels for dairy were underpinned by robust demand from China, which remains an important market for dairy, meat and wool, seafood and logs.

“Meat and wool exports have broken $8 billion, which is fantastic considering last year’s drought. Exports are expected to increase by around 22 percent for the five years to 2018.  

“Demand for logs from China is driving the growth of the forestry sector, with export value reaching $5.1 billion at the end of June 2014. Domestic demand for sawn timber is expected to increase with the Auckland and Christchurch housing markets growing.

“SOPI also forecasts horticulture export revenues to surpass $4 billion in 2016, a major milestone for the sector. Last week’s National Horticulture Fieldays in Hawke’s Bay was a great showcase of the potential of this exciting industry.

“Export earnings for the New Zealand seafood industry are expected to increase to $1.64 billion in 2018, with prices likely to remain high due to strong demand from China, Australia, US and the EU.

“This results are helped by programmes such as the Primary Growth Partnership (PGP), Sustainable Farming Fund, and the Irrigation Acceleration Fund which all deliver long-term value to the sector, and the New Zealand economy. 

“This report makes great reading for New Zealand’s primary industries as it enters the 2014/15 year, and I’m anticipating positive vibes at this week’s Mystery Creek National Fieldays,” says Mr Guy.
