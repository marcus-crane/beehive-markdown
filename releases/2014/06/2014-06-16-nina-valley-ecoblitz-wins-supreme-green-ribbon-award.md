Environment Minister Amy Adams has tonight announced that the Nina Valley Ecoblitz initiative is the Supreme Winner of the 2014 Green Ribbon Awards.

The winner was announced at a ceremony hosted by Ms Adams at Parliament tonight. A further 12 category winners from around New Zealand were also announced.

The Ecoblitz initiative was an event held in March this year to give students from 21 Canterbury and Westland schools the opportunity to work with ecologists, university lecturers and university ecology students, and to discover and document the species of the Nina Valley and surrounds.

The event consisted of 119 field activities which educated and inspired students and teachers and highlighted the importance of scientific methods in fieldwork. 

“The Nina Valley Ecoblitz initiative won the Supreme Award because of the unique way in which it brought students together with environmental experts to help students grow their scientific and environmental knowledge,” Ms Adams says.

“The schools have made science and the environment an integral part of the curriculum, but have also involved business, researchers and the wider community.

“Education plays an important role in preserving our environment. If students are encouraged to do their bit from a young age, we can improve and protect our environment now and for future generations to come.

“Solving environmental problems and consistently walking the talk on environmental issues is not easy, and it is often thankless.

“Tonight’s event was an ideal opportunity to thank the finalists on behalf of all New Zealanders. We are grateful for what they do.”
