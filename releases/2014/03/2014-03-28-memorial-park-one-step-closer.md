Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson says he is pleased with the progress being made on the construction of the National War Memorial Park. 

“The project took a major step forward today with the pouring of the first of the concrete roof sections for the underpass,” said Mr Finlayson. “This not only marks the transition from a trench to a tunnel, it marks a major step towards completion of the Park which will be built over the top of the road.”

The National War Memorial Park is being created by putting State Highway One underground where it passes in front of the National War Memorial.  It is due for completion in April 2015 in time for the centenary of the landings at Gallipoli. 

“I congratulate the contractors on the progress being made. When completed, the National War Memorial Park will be a significant place for the commemoration of New Zealanders’ service and sacrifice in war,” said Mr Finlayson.
