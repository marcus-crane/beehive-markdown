Changes to the Service Centre operating model to make it simpler for schools to address payroll and HR issues are the next priority as the remediation of Novopay continues, Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce says.

“The way the Service Centre operates has caused a lot of frustration for school administrators and staff. The Ministry of Education has been working on changes to the model with the sector in a project that began last September,” Mr Joyce says.

“As the Start of Year process starts to wind-down, this project is one of a number of priorities as we seek to further improve the Novopay system.”

Other planned changes in the next six months include improvements to the readability of payslips and regular administrative reports, and the project to reduce the complexity of the payroll system.

“We have a very complex pay system that has now caused problems for the introduction of not one but two new pay systems over the last 10 years,” Mr Joyce says. 

“We need to take the opportunity to review the way staff are paid and look to make some technical adjustments to reduce the complexity that has built up over 25 years. I look forward to sector players working with the Ministry on that project.”

The additional costs of remediation of Novopay now total $33 million to the end of December 2013, up from $28 million to the end of August last year.  The Ministry is budgeting a further $10 million of additional work for the second half of the financial year (to June 2014).

“Discussions between the Ministry and Talent2 on liability for additional costs are proceeding,” Mr Joyce says.
