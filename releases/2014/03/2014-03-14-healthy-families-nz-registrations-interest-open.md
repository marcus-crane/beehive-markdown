Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced the Registration of Interest process has opened for ‘Healthy Families NZ’ - the first step in the rollout of the government’s new healthy eating and anti-obesity initiative.

“Healthy Families NZ is a complete reform of the way we address the underlying causes of poor health, including obesity, smoking and excessive drinking,” says Mr Ryall.

“Too often resources have been spread thinly across the country. This is about building a dedicated health promotion effort in a specific and discrete number of high-risk communities.

“Ten communities have been selected to be part of this major new initiative, with an expected reach of around 900,000 New Zealanders.

“The key element of Healthy Families NZ will be a government-funded locally-based lead provider responsible for bringing together a partnership of key organisations in the community, and a dedicated health promotion workforce. Funding details will be announced in the Budget.

“These health promoters will work across schools, early childhood education centres, workplaces, and sports clubs, supporting New Zealanders to make healthy living choices. They will also work with other key organisations to implement initiatives supporting healthy living. 

“We’re now looking for registrations of interest from organisations who can act as lead providers for the local rollouts of this new initiative,” says Mr Ryall.

The communities are: **East Cape; Far North District; Invercargill City; Lower Hutt City; Rotorua District; Whanganui District; Manukau Ward; Manurewa-Papakura Ward; Spreydon-Heathcote Ward; and Waitakere Ward.**

“The Healthy Families approach is supported by a growing body of evidence, including Healthy Together Victoria, Colac in Australia, and EPODE in France. As a result of the Colac trial, children aged between four and 12 now weigh one kg less, have smaller waistlines, and a lower BMI compared to children in nearby towns,” says Mr Ryall.

“Encouraging individuals and their families to live healthy, active lives – by making good food choices, being physical active, sustaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and moderating alcohol consumption - is part of the government’s approach to reducing the prevalence and consequences of chronic disease in New Zealand,” says Mr Ryall.
