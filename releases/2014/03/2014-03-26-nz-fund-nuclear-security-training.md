Prime Minister John Key today announced that New Zealand contribute $300,000 towards nuclear security training in Africa and Latin America.

The Prime Minister made the announcement at the third Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, which has brought together leaders from 53 countries to ensure that States take the responsibilities for nuclear security seriously, and work with each other to ensure that nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of terrorists. 

Mr Key attended the first Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, DC in 2010 at the invitation of President Obama, and he also attended the second Summit in Seoul in March 2012.

The training, delivered in partnership with the United States, will benefit people who operate radiation detection equipment at major seaports.

“Being able to detect radiation is an essential step in preventing the illegal movement of nuclear material,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand is committed to improving the security of vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.”

Since the first Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, New Zealand has contributed more than $3 million to projects strengthening nuclear security.

“Our most recent contributions include $200,000 to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Nuclear Security Fund, and $570,000 to US-led projects that will support mobile detection capabilities in Africa and Latin America.  

“We have also provided $100,000 to the World Institute for Nuclear Security, which is working to produce an online certification system for nuclear security training.”

Mr Key has also taken the opportunity to hold meetings on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit with several world leaders.

These included Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel; Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron; Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper; and Presidents of the European Council and European Commission, Herman Van Rompuy and José Manuel Barroso.
