Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced that the SuperGold programme now has more than 11,000 business outlets offering discounts to over 630,000 older New Zealanders.

“Surpassing 11,000 business outlets is another milestone for the programme, further increasing the opportunities for cardholders to access discounts across the country,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The latest recruitment campaign has focussed on expanding the programme in rural, provincial and city fringe locations, targeting businesses in automotive, grocery, retail, legal services and trade.

“The campaign exceeded all expectations recruiting 800 new SuperGold participating businesses, this means in the last two years the number of participating businesses has more than quadrupled,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The ongoing growth and success of this programme means that older people can continue to stretch their dollar further by using their SuperGold Card.

“I am also pleased to announce that around half of the businesses added in the latest campaign are located outside of the main city centres.

“I remain committed to growing the number of participating businesses from provincial and rural areas to increase the value of the programme for people living there.

“SuperGold Card holders can also do their part in getting more organisations to join up by talking with local business owners who are not already in the scheme and encouraging them to sign on,” says Mrs Goodhew.

A list of the businesses offering SuperGold Card discounts in each region can be found at [www.supergold.govt.nz/directory](http://www.supergold.govt.nz/directory) or by calling 0800 25 45 65.
