A partnership between the Crown and the private sector will ensure Christchurch’s iconic Re:START Mall continues operating with the use of another central city location, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

The arrangement will see Re:START Mall retailers located on the northern side of Cashel Mall shift to a combination of Crown-owned and private land in the area of the Retail Precinct bounded by Oxford Terrace, Cashel Street, Plymouth Lane and Lichfield Street.

This will allow permanent Retail Precinct development to take place in the existing mall area. The Crown is providing support for the relocation of the mall in the form of a grant of $1.27 million to the Re:START the Heart Trust.

“Re:START Mall, with its clever use of brightly coloured freight containers, has become an icon for the recovery in Christchurch, a place for locals to gather, shop, and be entertained, and a very popular destination for tourists,” Mr Brownlee says.

“As the new Retail Precinct develops and permanent buildings are built on space Re:START Mall currently occupies, there is a need to find a new location, and I’m thrilled the Government could play a big part in making this happen.

“This arrangement means the mall will initially be able to operate for a year on the Crown-owned land, with potential for it to be extended to a second year.”

Trading is due to end in the existing northern part of the mall in late April, and contractors will work to have the retailers operating from the new site as soon as possible.

Re:START the Heart Trust chair John Suckling thanked the Government and the private landowners for their support in the making the shift possible, and the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust for a $3.36 million loan that helped get the mall off the ground in October 2011.

“We’re delighted that retailers in the northern part of the mall will now be able to trade for at least another 12 months,” Mr Suckling says.

“Our retailers have shown remarkable patience as we have worked through the planning process and I have nothing but admiration for their commitment. The majority were part of Re:START when we launched in October 2011 and they still have that same enthusiasm now.”

“Everyone knows how tough retail can be, and when you don’t have the critical mass of office workers around you it’s not always easy. But these retailers are committed to being in the CBD – in the face of other overtures and options they have wanted to stay in the heart of Christchurch.”
