Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced the seven community groups which will receive a skilled intern. 

“The Community Internship Programme (CIP) funds hapū, iwi or community groups to employ skilled professionals as interns to help them meet clearly identified objectives,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The programme focuses on skill-sharing and the exchange of knowledge between sectors, while building on-going relationships which continue after an internship ends.

“The programme provides wins for everyone involved – the community organisation, the intern and the workplace the intern is usually with.

“The $229,797 in funding will be shared amongst the successful community groups and will fund a variety of projects including relationship building, improving connections with the community, and building capability.”

The seven successful applicants for the 2013/2014 funding round are the: Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga Trust, Otago Youth Wellness Trust, St Martin Island Community Incorporated, The Supported Individualised Lifestyle Choices (SILC) Trust, Coromandel Independent Living Trust, The Hikurangi Foundation and Wellington Sexual Abuse Help Foundation.

Applications to the CIP Fund close in September each year and the allocations are for placements for three to six months or part-time internships of up to 12 months may also be considered.
