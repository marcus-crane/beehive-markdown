Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins says a partnership agreement signed by the Office of Ethnic Affairs (OEA) today will build more connections between new migrants and established businesses in New Zealand.

Under the new agreement, OEA, Export NZ and the Employers and Manufacturers Association will co-arrange and co-fund a major joint conference combining elements of Export New Zealand’s *Go Global* conference and OEA’s *Ethnic People in Commerce (EPICNZ)* conference.

“Partnership organisations have been working together since late last year on this agreement and I’m pleased today to have witnessed this signing which is a testament to their dedication to New Zealand businesses growth,” Ms Collins says.

“OEA’s EPICNZ conferences are run in the country’s main centres with participation having doubled over the last year, providing networking opportunities and promoting the social and economic benefits of ethnic diversity.

“ExportNZ also currently works with a range of organisations in the regions to promote and support exporters through networking events, conferences, seminars and exporter training such as its *Go Global* annual networking conference.

“This agreement will enable the partnership organisations to develop a collaborative programme working towards a joint conference and other networking events.

“The EMA’s expertise and business membership will also help to expand the reach of the EPICNZ conferences and it’s fantastic that the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) has signed up to be this year’s major sponsor.

“New Zealand is a great country in which to do business. The social and economic diversity of our population is one of New Zealand’s biggest strengths when it comes to growing businesses internationally.

“It’s crucial that New Zealand’s business community is well connected and working together and these organisations are working closely to enhance this”.

The first initiative under the partnership will be a joint *EPICNZ Go Global* International Business Forum to be held in Auckland on 2 May.
