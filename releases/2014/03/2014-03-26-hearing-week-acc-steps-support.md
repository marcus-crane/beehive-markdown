ACC is expected to double its spending on treatment for people with work or injury related hearing loss and ACC Minister Judith Collins says this has been supported by improved collaboration between ACC and the hearing sector.

Recently Ms Collins announced that from 1 July this year, ACC will be: increasing its contributions to the cost of hearing devices; introducing a flat fitting fee; covering up to two device consultations; contributing to ear moulds; and allowing multiple repairs for each hearing aid. The changes also include a general inflationary contribution increase of 1.78 per cent.

“ACC and the hearing sector have reinvigorated their relationship and are working more closely together to ensure clients suffering hearing loss are able to get the best treatment possible,” says Ms Collins.

“As a result, ACC will now pay separately for the hearing device consultation, the actual hearing aid and also the fitting. With up to two device consultations available, clients will have the choice of seeking other device options and prices from a different audiologist.

“It will also pay a fixed fitting fee so that regardless of the extent of hearing loss, ACC covered clients will have better access to hearing aid fittings.

“Children under the age of 18 years with traumatic hearing loss have better access to more frequent checks, refitting and updated devices as their needs change.

“I’m receiving fantastic feedback from providers and advocates in the hearing sector about their developing relationship with ACC and their closer involvement in this policy process.

“I congratulate ACC, hearing providers and hearing advocates for their efforts and improved collaboration which is already producing positive results for ACC’s clients with hearing loss”.
