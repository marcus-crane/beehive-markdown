Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says 3D models of buildings past, present and planned are being made available from today to help people visualise how the Christchurch central city will look.

As part of the Canterbury spatial data infrastructure programme, led by Land Information New Zealand, a set of 3D models of buildings pre-earthquake have been released under an open license, making them available to anyone.

“The ability to better visualise changes will play a key role in engagement, consultation, enhanced planning decisions and efficiency.

“The models available include demolished buildings, as well as those that remain standing.  The models cover commercial buildings within the four avenues, and are available in formats for use in a range of applications,” Mr Williamson says.

Models of existing buildings will also be used as part of a current and future city model, which will assist architects to design new buildings against current and planned surroundings.

“This means yet to be built buildings can be included in visualisations of the future city.  It will also be easier to run simulations to plan urban form and the effects of wind and shade,” Mr Williamson says.

The Canterbury spatial data infrastructure programme supports the rebuild by enabling improved sharing of location based information between government agencies and the private sector.
