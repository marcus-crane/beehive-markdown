Paula Bennett will travel to Chile today to represent New Zealand at the inauguration ceremony for Chilean President-elect Michelle Bachelet on 11 March.

“I’m honoured to represent New Zealand at this significant international occasion, and look forward to congratulating Michelle Bachelet on achieving her second term as President," Mrs Bennett said.

Ms Bachelet served as the President of the Republic of Chile from 2006 to 2010, and was subsequently appointed the first Executive Director of the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

“Strong female representation is absolutely vital for the growth and success of all nations, and as a fellow female politician I’m excited to meet with and congratulate this amazing woman," Mrs Bennett said

“New Zealand and Chile have strong long-standing diplomatic ties, with a New Zealand Embassy opening in Santiago in 1972, and this visit provides an opportunity to build on that thriving relationship."
