Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Grahame Morton as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to India.

Mr Morton will be based in New Delhi and cross-accredited to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal.

“As members of the Commonwealth New Zealand and India have a close relationship,” Mr McCully says. 

India is our largest source of skilled migrants and our second largest market for international students.

“Two-way goods and services trade exceeds $1.5 billion and the government has high expectations for the development of India as a key economic and political partner for New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Morton is currently the Director of North Asia Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has previously served in Beijing and the Cook Islands.
