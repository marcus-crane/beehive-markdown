Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama’s decision to step down as Commander of the Fiji military.

“Separating the government and the military is an important step toward holding credible elections in Fiji later this year,” Mr McCully says.

“Today’s announcement is an important milestone on that road.

“The Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Contact Group met in Fiji last month and was pleased to see the registration of political parties and voters as well as the appointment of Electoral Commission members.

“New Zealand is providing assistance to the Fiji Elections Office and stands ready to provide further support as needed,” Mr McCully says.
