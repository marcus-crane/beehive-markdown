Revenue Minister Todd McClay has described Inland Revenue’s App4IR Challenge as “an exciting opportunity for the New Zealand ICT market” during the competition’s launch at Creative HQ today.

The App4IR Challenge is designed to help Inland Revenue develop a mobile app to make interacting with our tax system easier and faster.

The Challenge is open to all individuals and organisations that operate in New Zealand and the applicant with the best concept will be paid $10 000 and be given the opportunity to further develop the app with Inland Revenue.

“App4IR calls for people with innovation and is therefore a great opportunity for New Zealand software developers and businesses,” Mr McClay says

“The current mobile web app has proved very successful but technology and customer expectations constantly change. Mobile services are continually improving and more people have tablets and smart-phones allowing them to interact with government agencies 24 hours, seven days a week.”

“The current app is aimed at individual customers; however the App4IR Challenge is about seeking ideas so Inland Revenue can provide more services and greater usability for its thousands of business customers also.”

“The Government and Inland Revenue are committed to responding to changing technology and customer expectations and this initiative is another step in that direction.”

Applicants are welcome to submit concepts until 14 April. Six finalists will then be offered the chance to present their ideas Dragons Den-style to a panel of judges, and from those a winner will be found.

“I encourage individuals, companies, software developers and organisations from New Zealand with an interest in mobile technology to take part in this competition and be a part of Inland Revenue’s change journey,” Mr McClay says.
