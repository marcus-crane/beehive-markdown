Efforts to coordinate central and local government procurement of aerial imagery will ensure better value for money and open access to the data, Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Aerial imagery is captured from airborne sensors and cameras, and its uses include land management and disaster recovery planning.

“Land Information New Zealand is working with local authorities and government agencies to establish a national programme for coordinating public sector imagery purchases.

“This will ensure imagery is purchased on an open licence and at a consistent standard, which will mean value for money and open access,” Mr Williamson says.

An imagery collection programme, enabled by collaboration between central and local government and the private sector, is currently underway for some areas of the South Island not recently captured.  Land Information New Zealand is also working to make imagery available through the LINZ Data Service.

“Aerial imagery can be used by the forestry and agriculture industries to help improve land productivity, and is also a useful tool for planning construction and engineering works.

“The Government has an objective of releasing high value data for public reuse, and ensuring imagery is collected under an open licence means it can be reused by anyone,” Mr Williamson says.
