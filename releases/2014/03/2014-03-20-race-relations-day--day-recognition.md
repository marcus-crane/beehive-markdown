Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins says Race Relations Day tomorrow is a time to recognise the contribution that  greater ethnic diversity makes to the social and economic fabric of New Zealand.

New Zealand is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the OECD with over 200 ethnicities and over 100 languages now spoken on our shores. Census 2013 data reveals a particularly large increase in New Zealanders of Chinese, Indian and Filipino descent.

“Even in the face of significant population change we’ve built an internationally enviable reputation for social cohesion that is going from strength to strength,” Ms Collins says.

“New Zealanders embrace ethnic diversity and recognise the opportunities it brings for our progress as individuals, businesses and as a nation.

“We have greater diversity in schools, workplaces and leadership positions and we are all better off for it.

“This year’s Race Relations Day theme, *I am Aotearoa/New Zealand, together we grow*, reflects the fact that New Zealand’s success relies on us working together and ensuring the benefits of ethnic diversity are fully realised.

“As a Government we are committed to making sure all New Zealanders are able to participate and contribute to our cultural, social and economic life here in New Zealand”.

Race Relations Day is New Zealand’s equivalent to the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which commemorates the 1960 Sharpeville massacre in South Africa.
