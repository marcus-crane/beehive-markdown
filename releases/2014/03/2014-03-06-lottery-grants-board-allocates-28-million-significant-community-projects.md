Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board Hon Peter Dunne has announced the names of the successful applicants to the Lottery Significant Projects Fund.

“The Significant Projects Fund enables major community projects to become a reality, building on the vision of communities, and creating legacies for future generations. I am therefore pleased to announce that over $28 million has been approved to fund important projects across New Zealand, supporting a range of environmental, cultural and sporting projects,” says Mr Dunne

Amongst a wide range of grants, $6 million has been made to the Theatre Royal Charitable Foundation to aid the reconstruction of the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch. 

“The theatre was badly damaged by the earthquakes in Christchurch in 2010 and 2011. This grant will also support the rejuvenation of the arts precinct in Christchurch.”

A further grant will assist in Christchurch being the principal venue for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. $1.05 million has been granted towards the cost of building Hagley Oval Pavilion, which will be used for the opening game of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. This grant is specifically tofund the roof construction.

Another grant the Minister highlighted is $5.75 million that has been awarded to support the development of a national museum at Waitangi. This grant will enable the Waitangi National Trust Board to house and share with New Zealanders its collection of objects, artefacts and documents at one of New Zealand's most recognised historic sites.

In addition, $1.67 million has been awarded to Onuku Rununga Incorporated Society to complete the redevelopment of Onuku Marae.

“This is a significant site for New Zealand as it was the first place in the South Island where Te Tiriti o Waitangi was signed by Ngāi Tahu Chiefs,” says Mr Dunne.

Decisions on applications to the Lottery Significant Projects Fund are determined by an independent committee, with the application process administered by the Department of Internal Affairs. The Minister said the committee was impressed with the calibre and diversity of applications submitted.

“I would like to acknowledge and thank the committee members for their work. It would have been no easy task determining the outcome from a range of applicants seeking over $65 millionin funding,” the Minister said.

A full list of the names of successful applicants and the grants awarded can be found below.
