Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse has acknowledged the outstanding service of Brigadier Richard (Rick) Ottaway.

The General Manager of Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand (VANZ) and Secretary for War Pensions today announced his plan to retire in the coming months after 51 years’ service with the New Zealand Defence Force.

“The fact that Rick’s public service has spanned more than 50 years speaks for itself. From Viet Nam, to Veteran’s Affairs, he has served New Zealand with impeccable honour and loyalty,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Rick’s involvement in what is the most significant rewrite of veterans’ legislation in 60 years, the Veterans’ Support Bill, will be a lasting legacy of support for thousands of current and future veterans.

“While his leadership and experience will be missed, no one can dispute that Rick has earned his retirement.”

The Chief of the Defence Force will appoint a replacement General Manager to lead VANZ in the next few months.
