Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Georgina Roberts as the new High Commissioner to Vanuatu.

“New Zealand and Vanuatu have close ties.  In the last year over 2800 Vanuatu workers took part in the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme in New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.

“The scheme is a great success and is having a material impact on livelihoods in Vanuatu. 

“Ms Roberts will be responsible for leading the delivery of New Zealand’s Official Development Programme in Vanuatu, including $17 million toward an upgrade of shipping services and port facilities.”

Ms Roberts has previously served in Pretoria, London and Addis Ababa.
