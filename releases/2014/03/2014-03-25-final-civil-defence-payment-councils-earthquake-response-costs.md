Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the Government’s final reimbursement to Canterbury councils for civil defence emergency response costs related to the Canterbury earthquakes.

In total, the Government has paid $215.288 million to Environment Canterbury Regional Council (ECan), Christchurch City Council, Waimakariri District Council and Selwyn District Council for their responses to the September 2010 and February, June and December 2011 earthquakes.

This final payment of $65,000 is to ECan, and brings the full reimbursement for ECan to $1.952 million.

“Each council has the initial responsibility for a civil defence response in its area. I would like to acknowledge the important and significant work done by the councils in Canterbury and thank all the individuals involved,” Ms Kaye says.

“The financial assistance for the response period pays for essential civil defence costs incurred in accommodating, transporting, feeding and clothing displaced people, and for essential infrastructure repair, and other response costs.

“Canterbury has had a tough three years and civil defence emergency management has played a significant role in earthquake response,” Ms Kaye says. “Finalising the response-related issues is an important step forward. The focus is now on the rebuilding that is underway.

“The Government remains absolutely committed to rebuilding Canterbury.”

In a significant civil defence emergency, central government supports local authorities with direct financial assistance. The aim is to cover the response costs and allow the community to focus on recovery as quickly as possible.

**Please note:**

- This claim covers the period up to 30 June 2012, which the Government has agreed is the end-date for response cost claims for the Canterbury events. All costs incurred after that date in relation to the Canterbury events must be claimed as recovery costs, and are being processed through the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA).
- All other civil defence claims were finalised in 2013.  The Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) has been working with ECan on the final claim to ensure all information has been provided.
- DIA has assessed more than 20 civil defence response claims from Canterbury councils since 2011.  This is the sixth claim from ECan for response costs arising from the Canterbury earthquakes.  To date, ECan has been reimbursed $1.887 million, for the costs of welfare assistance, building inspections, silt removal, stopbank repairs, aerial damage assessments, and water quality testing.
