An amendment to regulations that control discharge from ships and offshore installations will protect New Zealand’s unique marine environment, Environment Minister Amy Adams announced today.

“The regulations will be amended to prohibit all forms of garbage (with the exception of food waste) from being discharged from ships into the coastal marine area,” Ms Adams says.

“Garbage from ships could pose a significant risk to marine life and safety. This amendment will help to protect recreational and ecological values in coastal areas.

“While international shipping operators are already complying with the new requirements, it is important for this change to be made formally through amending the regulations.”

The changes will be made via amendments to the Resource Management (Marine Pollution) Regulations 1998.

The changes to the Regulations will also prohibit the discharge of incinerator ash, cargo residues and cleaning substances that are harmful to the marine environment. The Regulations will make exceptions in certain circumstances for the accidental loss of garbage and fishing gear.

New Zealand is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (MARPOL), which controls discharge of harmful substances from ships.

The changes to these Regulations reflect changes made to Annex V of MARPOL, which controls the discharge of garbage from ships.
