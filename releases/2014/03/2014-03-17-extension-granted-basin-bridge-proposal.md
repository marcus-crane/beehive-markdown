The Board of Inquiry appointed to decide on the New Zealand Transport Agency’s Basin Bridge proposal has been granted a three-month extension to issue its final report and decision, Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced.

The Board requested a time extension to ensure that the decision-making process would provide a full and fair hearing.

Ms Adams says it is disappointing the Board is not able to meet the original expectations set out for the inquiry, but recognised there are particular circumstances that need to be taken into account.

“The Board’s request for a time extension cited the substantial volume of material, a large number of distinctive issues and the length of time necessary to allow for cross-examination of witnesses as extraordinary circumstances in support of its request.

“Based on previous proposals decided by a Board of Inquiry, an extension of this length is an exception rather than the norm.

“The Board has been asked to make necessary provisions to ensure that the final decision will be made by the new date.”

In granting the extension of time, Ms Adams has taken into account the fact that the Board’s application was supported by the applicant.

The final decision on the Basin Bridge proposal is now due on Saturday 30 August 2014.
