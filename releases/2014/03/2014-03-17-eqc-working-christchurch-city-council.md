Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission Gerry Brownlee says EQC is exploring making a financial contribution to Christchurch City Council-led area-wide flood mitigation as part of its role settling residential land damage claims.

“This is being explored as a possible option for settlement of some Canterbury land claims on properties identified as at an increased vulnerability to flooding, including some properties in the Flockton area,” Mr Brownlee says.  

“Residential land with an increased vulnerability to flooding as a direct result of the earthquakes is covered by the Earthquake Commission Act.

“EQC has been investigating affected land, as well as looking at how to settle these claims.

“This has included working with the Christchurch City Council in recent months to understand where there may be opportunities to undertake area-wide works to mitigate some of the flooding risk faced by many Christchurch homeowners.

“Any work on an area wide solution to flooding risk will be led by the Christchurch City Council.

“The council is working on the initial stages of identifying where these works could take place and the government has offered any help it can provide to expedite getting them underway.

“EQC and its engineers, Tonkin and Taylor, are continuing to work on identifying properties now at an increased risk of flooding due to the earthquakes and this will be completed shortly,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Mayor of Christchurch Lianne Dalziel says the announcement is a positive development.

“It will provide considerable reassurance to residents whose properties are subject to increased flood vulnerability as a result of the earthquakes and who would benefit from area wide solutions,” Ms Dalziel says.
