ACC Minister Judith Collins has announced the appointment of three new Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC) members and says this comes at a time when ACC is boosting its focus on injury prevention across the board.

The MSAC acts as a voice for motorcyclists by advising ACC how to invest funds collected through the Motorcycle Safety Levy paid by motorcyclists in the relicensing process.

“I’m pleased to announce the appointment of new Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council members Janice Millman, Andrew Darrell and David Golightly,” says Ms Collins.

“The MSAC plays a significant role in the development of initiatives to make motorcycling safer in New Zealand. These new members will enhance the Council’s skillset and expertise, giving it wider representation around the country and increase its connections with the motorcycling community.

“While motorcycling will never be completely safe, the MSAC has been instrumental in the implementation of a range of practical initiatives to make a real difference.”

The Council has worked on projects such as the Southern Coromandel Loop initiative, the introduction of Land Transport rules allowing the use of safer motorcycle lighting configurations and is also initiating evidence-based pilot initiatives as a result of a commissioned Monash University report.

“ACC is significantly boosting its efforts in injury prevention across the board and an important part of this is making motorcycling safer for New Zealanders,” says Ms Collins.

“I congratulate the new members and am confident that with their depth of motorcycling experience they will make a fantastic contribution to motorcycle safety in New Zealand.”

The new members will start on 7 April 2014 for a term of two years.
