New Zealanders will have a great chance to see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge when they visit New Zealand in April, says Prime Minister John Key.

Kensington Palace and the 2014 Royal Visit Office in New Zealand this morning announced that the Duke and Duchess would visit eight New Zealand centres between 7-16 April this year.

“It’s a pretty good geographic spread, with four South Island and four North Island centres included in the itinerary," said Mr Key.

The Duke and Duchess will be based at Government House in Wellington and mostly make day trips to different parts of the country, then return to be with Prince George in the evening.

“We’re trying to make it as easy as possible for them to have regular family time with their son, while acknowledging thousands of New Zealanders will want to take the opportunity to meet them," says Mr Key.

From their base at Government House in Wellington, the Duke and Duchess will also visit Auckland, Hamilton, Cambridge, Blenheim Christchurch, Dunedin and Queenstown. Prince George will stay at Government House.
