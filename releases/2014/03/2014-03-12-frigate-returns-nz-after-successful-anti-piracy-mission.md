Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the crew of HMNZS Te Mana should be proud of their contribution to international anti-piracy efforts.

“HMNZS Te Mana has today arrived back in New Zealand after a highly successful three month deployment supporting anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden region,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand has a direct interest in protecting international shipping lanes with a large volume of our trade carried by sea. The deployment of HMNZS Te Mana was a valuable opportunity for the Royal New Zealand Navy to work with the US-led Combined Maritime Forces and with NATO.

“I would like to thank the crew of HMNZS Te Mana for their hard work and contribution to maintaining a secure maritime environment.

“HMNZS Te Mana built strong relationships and enhanced interoperability with a range of international partners, including Spain, Denmark, Japan, the US and Australia.

“The frigate conducted a total of 94 boardings to check for evidence of piracy. The ship’s helicopter conducted 81 sorties gathering aerial imagery of the maritime environment, and helping to deter criminal activity.”

HMNZS Te Mana operated as part of the Combined Maritime Forces, a multi-national naval partnership of 30 nations, and conducted a short rotation with NATO’s anti-piracy mission, Operation Ocean Shield.
