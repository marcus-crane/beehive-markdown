Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says developments in Ukraine are “deeply worrying”.

“We call on all parties to exercise restraint and refrain from any action that could escalate tensions,” Mr McCully says.

“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected and maintained.

“The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met today to discuss this issue. It remains a matter of active consideration and the New Zealand Government is watching closely.

“The UNSC is the appropriate body to take the lead and we expect the Council to live up to its responsibilities,” Mr McCully says.
