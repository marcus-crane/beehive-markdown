Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says the National Freight Demand Study 2014, released today, is a ringing endorsement of the Government’s work programme to future proof roading networks in New Zealand’s most populous regions and their linkages to strategic ports.

“Put simply the National Freight Demand Study 2014 says the $12 billion investment in the Roads of National Significance couldn’t have come at a better time,” Mr Brownlee says.

The study provides a snapshot of New Zealand’s current freight task and a forecast of what New Zealand’s future freight task will look like over the next 30 years.  Mr Brownlee says the freight task is substantial and growing.

“This year around 236 million tonnes of freight will be moved around New Zealand.

“For each member of the population, this is the equivalent of about 50 tonnes of freight moved on their behalf, and the pressure this puts on the transport system is enormous.

“But the important thing to note is New Zealand’s freight task is projected to increase by about 50 per cent over the next 30 years, with tonnage in the Auckland and Canterbury regions projected to grow by 78 per cent and 73 per cent respectively,” Mr Brownlee says.

Strong tonnage growth is also predicted in other regions, showing the case for improving transport infrastructure linking major population centres with inland and coastal ports is very strong, Mr Brownlee says.

“Let’s not forget Labour and the Greens would put a halt to this much needed progress, by axing an improved state highway link between Auckland to the north, and leaving Wellington with 1950s infrastructure by cancelling Transmission Gully and the rest of the rest of the Wellington Northern Corridor road of National Significance.”

The study gives government and freight operators an understanding of the commodity mix, volumes and flows of freight across New Zealand.

“Efficient movement of freight and understanding the drivers of future demand is critical to help determine what infrastructure and support we need over the next 30 years,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This study provides useful information for planning at both a nationwide and regional level.”
