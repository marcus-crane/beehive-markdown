Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced the first four organisations to receive direct Government funding through the Industry Training Fund direct funding pilot. 

“Following a review of industry training in 2011, we have implemented a number of changes to boost performance and participation, encourage competition and innovation, as well as simplifying the industry training system,” Mr Joyce says.

“This includes expanding apprenticeships by creating New Zealand Apprentices and providing support to new apprentices with our Apprenticeship Reboot; increasing the rate of funding for industry training; and now increasing competition by allowing employers direct access to industry training funding in a new pilot scheme.

“The review found some employers believed their ITO didn’t meet their specific needs. Giving employers the option or choice of direct access to industry training funding provides them with a training alternative and, at the same time, will encourage ITOs to provide quality service to their local businesses.”

The successful four organisations to receive direct industry training funding are: Engineering Taranaki Consortium; Southern Group Training (Northland and Southland); Ryman Healthcare (nationwide); NZ Kiwifruit Growers Incorporated (Bay of Plenty).  A total of 1310 employees are expected to be trained through the four organisations at a cost of $2.09 million.

“The four organisations were selected following a competitive tender process and have shown a commitment to training that will benefit the trainees, their organisations, and the country as a whole,” Mr Joyce says.

“By opening up the Industry Training Fund, employers are now able to provide on-the-job training specifically tailored to their business. It differentiates them from other types of tertiary education offered by polytechnics and private training establishments while still giving trainees NZQA-approved qualifications that are transferrable.”
