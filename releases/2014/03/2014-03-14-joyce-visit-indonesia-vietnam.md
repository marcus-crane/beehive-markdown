Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce leaves on Sunday for Indonesia and Vietnam to highlight the growing New Zealand-ASEAN trade, energy and education relationship.

“In the past five years, New Zealand’s trade with ASEAN countries, including Indonesia and Vietnam, has grown at a rate greater than with any other of our major trading partners except China. ASEAN is New Zealand’s third largest trading partner accounting for 13 per cent of New Zealand’s total merchandise trade in 2013 and we want to keep building on this strong relationship,” Mr Joyce says.

In Indonesia, Mr Joyce will open the New Zealand Education Fair in Jakarta attended by 29 New Zealand education institutions. He will also give a keynote speech at the Indonesia New Zealand Renewable Energy Forum, which 11 New Zealand companies are attending as part of a renewable energy mission to promote our geothermal energy expertise in the Philippines and Indonesia.

Mr Joyce will also meet key Indonesian ministers and host a New Zealand Gala Dinner bringing together influential New Zealanders and Indonesians across the food and beverage, tourism, education and energy sectors. In Vietnam, Mr Joyce will visit the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City to promote New Zealand education and will also meet with New Zealand businesses.

“New Zealand’s exports to Indonesia have doubled since 2005 to $886 million in 2013. Last year, Indonesia was New Zealand’s 11th largest trading partner with total bilateral trade valued at $1.64 billion. Trade with Vietnam is also growing – last year exports grew by 6 per cent to $451million.

“The presence of New Zealand education institutions in Indonesia has been modest to date but is increasing. In Vietnam our education links are long-standing, underpinned by an Arrangement for Education Cooperation. This trip provides the opportunity to both highlight our educational strengths – including the opportunities for international students to study in New Zealand – alongside building on our trade and investment opportunities, in the ASEAN region.”

Minister Joyce returns to New Zealand on Friday 21 March.
