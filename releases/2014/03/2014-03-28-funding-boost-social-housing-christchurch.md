Five community housing providers are to receive $14 million from the Government and the Canterbury Community Trust (TCCT) to build 75 units in Christchurch, Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith and TCCT trustee Sue McKenzie announced today.

“Housing is one of the most difficult challenges Canterbury faces in the wake of the earthquakes, with the loss of damaged homes, the demand for temporary housing while other houses are fixed and the extra housing required for the reconstruction workforce.  This announcement with the Canterbury Community Trust is about partnering with community organisations and is focussed on assisting those in greatest housing need,” Dr Smith says.

“This collaborative effort between the Government and TCCT is about effecting real and lasting benefits as part of the rebuild and for the provision of on-going social housing in the region,” Ms McKenzie says.

The community housing providers to receive the latest funding support are:

- Abbeyfield New Zealand (13 units/14 bedrooms in Hornby)
- Abbeyfield Ellesmere (14 units/14 bedrooms in Ellesmere)
- Vision West (two units/three bedrooms in Spreydon; 20 units/50 bedrooms in Kaiapoi)
- New Zealand Housing Foundation (10 units/35 bedrooms in southwest Christchurch, Kaiapoi, Rolleston and Hornby)
- Comcare Charitable Trust (16 units/16 bedrooms in Spreydon, Addington, Barrington, Phillipstown, Linwood or St Albans)

The $14 million will be put towards projects that have a total value of $22 million.  The joint contribution comes from a $31 million fund for social housing in Canterbury – made up of $21 million from the Government’s Social Housing Fund and $10 million from TCCT’s one-off $25 million Special Fund.

“TCCT’s Special Fund is aimed at rebuilding the fabric of Canterbury communities and supporting the social infrastructure of Christchurch. We recognise the way forward in making a tangible difference for our community is through cooperation, and our partnership with the Government around social housing is just one of the steps we are taking to make these differences a reality,” Ms McKenzie says.

“This philanthropic investment by TCCT in social housing for Canterbury is a great act of generosity. The Government wants to see more diversity in the provision of social housing in New Zealand for those most in need and an important part of that involves expanding the community housing sector, which this latest funding announcement will enable,” Dr Smith says.

“There is no magic bullet to addressing Canterbury’s housing challenge.  The answer lies in making progress on every front, including expanding and repairing private, council, community and state housing.  These projects named today make further progress in growing the community housing sector,” Dr Smith concluded.
