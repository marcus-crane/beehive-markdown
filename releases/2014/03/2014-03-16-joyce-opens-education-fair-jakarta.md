Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today opened an education trade fair in Jakarta that continues the push to grow New Zealand international education in Indonesia.

The fair was attended by almost 30 New Zealand educational institutions, including universities, institutes of technology and polytechnics, and schools.

Mr Joyce is in Jakarta to highlight the Indonesia-New Zealand trade, investment and education relationship. He will take part in education and energy sector meetings, and he will also host senior Indonesian officials and company representatives at a gala dinner showcasing New Zealand food and beverage.

“New Zealand’s trade, investment and development relationship with Indonesia is strengthening, and international education has an important part to play in that growth,” Mr Joyce says.

“We have an established model of Indonesian students joining New Zealand classrooms and an increasing number of New Zealand education programmes delivered within Indonesia via partnerships.

“International education creates connections of enduring value between our two nations: increasing our understanding of each other, and contributing to the growing political, economic and trade links between New Zealand and Indonesia.”

Mr Joyce was pleased to see the number and calibre of exhibits in the fair run by Education New Zealand. The Jakarta event follows a similar size fair in Surabaya yesterday.

“The fair demonstrates New Zealand’s strengths. We’re providing English language education among the best in the world, offering high quality qualifications in supportive, welcoming and safe learning environments,” Mr Joyce says.

Mr Joyce continues his education and trade mission on Monday 18 March, before heading to Vietnam.
