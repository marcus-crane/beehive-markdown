Former rugby league coach and businessman Graham Lowe ONZM, QSM has been appointed to chair a forum which will consider whether further restrictions should be placed on the marketing of alcohol.

The Ministerial Forum on Alcohol Advertising and Sponsorship will gather evidence and expert advice about the effectiveness of possible advertising or sponsorship controls.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says Cabinet agreed to the forum in 2011 when the alcohol reform legislation was being considered by Parliament.

“The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012, which came into full effect in December 2013, introduced stronger controls on alcohol advertising and promotion. The Act makes it an offence to promote alcohol in a way that appeals to minors and bans free or heavily-discounted promotions,” Justice Minister Judith Collins says.

“This new Forum will support this Government’s commitment to addressing communities’ concerns about reducing the harm alcohol can cause.”

Associate Minister of Health Peter Dunne says the selected forum members are well regarded in their respective fields of expertise.

“With its diverse and qualified makeup, I’m sure the panel will come up with practical, effective and evidence-based recommendations,” Mr Dunne says.

In addition to Graham Lowe, the Forum comprises:

- Professor Max Abbott, an expert in the field of addiction and alcohol-related harm
- Sandra Alofivae, a lawyer and district health board member who works in the Auckland Alcohol and Drug Pilot Court
- Dr Farah Palmer, an academic and former Black Ferns captain, who is currently a director on the NZRU Maori Rugby Board
- Tuari Potiki, director of Maori Development at the University of Otago and the current chair of the NZ Drug Foundation, and
- Hilary Souter, chief executive since 2005 of the Advertising Standards Authority.

The Forum will call for public submissions in March and will report back to both Ministers later this year.
