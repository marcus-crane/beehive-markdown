Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will lift all its travel sanctions against Fiji.

“The progress that Fiji is making towards holding free and fair elections deserves recognition from the Pacific region and international community,” Mr McCully says.

“There are now more than 500,000 people registered to vote in the September elections, electoral commissioners have been appointed and importantly Commodore Bainimarama has stepped down as the head of the Military.

“The visit by the Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Contact Group in February was a success and the Commonwealth recently acknowledged the progress that Fiji is making.

“Last week the electoral decree was published, an Elections Supervisor appointed, and the 17th of September was announced as the election date.

“As a consequence of these developments New Zealand will be ending all the remaining travel sanctions we have in place against Fiji.  This is a continuation of our policy to support the Fiji’s return to democratic rule and reflects our close cooperation with Australia on matters relating to Fiji.

“The changes will end New Zealand’s travel ban, and remove all remaining restrictions on New Zealand Government departments working directly with their Fiji counterparts.

“Lifting our remaining sanctions will allow us to throw our full weight behind supporting Fiji’s return to democracy and normalise our relationship with one of our closest neighbours,” Mr McCully says.
