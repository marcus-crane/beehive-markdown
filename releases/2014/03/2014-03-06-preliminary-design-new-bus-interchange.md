Christchurch’s new $53 million Bus Interchange promises to be a state of the art, user-friendly facility, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

Mr Brownlee today released images of preliminary designs for the Crown-led anchor project which will provide a new public transport hub replacing the city’s earthquake damaged facility.

“The Christchurch Central Development Unit and its partner agencies worked with designers on a range of options, and the favoured design was thoroughly tested to ensure the layout accommodates the manoeuvring of the buses and spaces for the public to feel safe and comfortable while using the services,” Mr Brownlee says.

“With enclosures to protect bus patrons from the elements and an open plan passenger lounge with self-service ticketing and bicycle storage, the facility is designed to link to other modes of transport and to cope with projected transport growth through until 2041.

“The Bus Interchange will link to new super-stops in the central city and suburban hubs for ease of travel around the city. It’s also been designed to provide opportunities for development by the private sector in the wider Bus Interchange Precinct including potential for retail, accommodation and entertainment.”

Detailed designs are still to be finalised, and construction is expected to begin in the middle of this year, with the facility due to be operating by the second quarter of next year.
