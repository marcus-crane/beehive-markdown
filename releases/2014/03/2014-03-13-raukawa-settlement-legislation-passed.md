The House sat extended hours this morning to pass the third reading of the Raukawa Claims Settlement Bill, which will give effect to the iwi’s historical Treaty settlement with the Crown. 

The House also passed the Nga Manawa Whenua o Tamaki Makaurau Collective Redress Bill and the Nga Punawai o Te Tokotoru Claims Settlement Bill through their second readings.

“Since 2012 Standing Orders have allowed for extended sitting hours to be used. The Business Committee has used them to great effect to progress settlement bills and other non-controversial legislation,” Treaty Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson said. “It is a credit to the parties and members across this House that they have supported this innovative approach to enable settling iwi to receive the benefits of settlements in a more timely fashion.” 

The Raukawa Claims Settlement Bill gives effect to the settlement of the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of the central North Island iwi, Raukawa. It includes an agreed historical account, Crown acknowledgments and apology and commercial redress totalling $50 million including the value of the 2008 Central North Island Forestry Settlement, and also returns culturally significant sites along the Waikato River and in other areas. It also strengthens the commercial relationship between Raukawa and Mighty River Power.

The debate on the bill’s third reading was led off by Whānau Ora Minister Tariana Turia, the Member of Parliament for Te Tai Hauāuru.

The vote was greeted by a waiata from Raukawa members who travelled to Parliament to see the final reading.

The Ngā Punawai o Te Tokotoru Settlement Bill will settle the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Ngāti Rangiteaorere and Tapuika. At third reading, the omnibus bill will be separated into individual settlement legislation for each iwi.

The Business Committee has also decided that the bill be progressed to third reading from the second reading, after it agreed the bill does not require consideration in committee of the whole House.

The Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Collective Settlement Bill will give effect to the to the deed between Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau (Tāmaki Collective) and the Crown for collective redress in relation to specific maunga (volcanic cones), motu (islands) and lands within Tāmaki Makaurau over which the iwi/hapū have shared interests. The bill will next go to a Committee of the Whole House, before its third reading.
