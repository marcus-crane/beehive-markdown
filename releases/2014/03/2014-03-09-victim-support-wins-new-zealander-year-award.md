Justice Minister Judith Collins has congratulated the New Zealand Council of Victim Support Groups (Victim Support) for winning the New Zealander of the Year Award in the community section.

“I am delighted that Victim Support’s been recognised for the work it does to empower victims of crime to regain control of their lives,” Ms Collins says.

“This achievement is testament to the dedication of over 1,000 volunteers and staff who provide 24/7 help to thousands of victims of crime each year.”

Ms Collins says the Government shares Victim Support’s commitment to ensuring victims and their families can take control of getting their lives back on track.

“People caught up in the criminal system, through no fault of their own, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,” Ms Collins says.

“This week Parliament passed the second reading of our Victims of Crime Reform Bill. The Bill improves how victims of crime are treated by the justice system and ensures it is more responsive to their needs.

“We’re also making changes to victim impact statements that will widen their scope and provide victims of serious offences the right to read out their statement in court.”

Each year the Ministry of Justice provides $6.32 million funding Victim Support to provide crisis and on-going support for victims of crime. The Ministry also administers grants, funded through the Offender Levy, towards the costs of dealing with incidents and attending court and other criminal justice processes.

Additional funds have also been provided to Victim Support this financial year to pilot an enhanced support service for homicide victims.
