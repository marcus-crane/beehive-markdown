Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has announced a staged 20 per cent decrease in the airline passenger security charges for domestic passengers over the next two years.

“Passenger security charges are paid by airlines on behalf of passengers,” Mr Brownlee says. 

“The charges are levied on airlines and are generally passed on to passengers in the price of an air ticket.”

From April 1 the charge will be reduced by 78c from $4.60 per domestic passenger to $3.82, and a further reduction of 11c will be made on 1 April 2015 to $3.71.  A final reduction of 6c will be made on 1 April 2016 to $3.65.

International passenger security charges will also decrease, with the current charge of $11.98 per passenger reducing to $11.01 on 1 April 2017.  (All figures include GST.)

Mr Brownlee says the decision to reduce charges follows completion of a thorough review of the Aviation Security Service (Avsec).

“The review’s recommendations will improve Avsec’s financial management and overall efficiency.

“Avsec’s reserves will also be built to between $4 million and $12 million – with a target of $10 million – to cover seasonal and business fluctuations in air travel.

“The review has ensured that Avsec will continue to have the resources to safeguard the security of air passengers.

“By 1 April 2016, the domestic charge will have been reduced by 95 cents per passenger and by 1 April 2017 the international charge will have been reduced by 97 cents per passenger,” Mr Brownlee says.
