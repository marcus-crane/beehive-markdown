Leading Pacific health experts gathered last night at the Growing Pacific Solutions (GPS 2.0) conference to discuss ways to work better together and improve the overall health and wellbeing of Pacific people.

Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, spoke at the opening dinner and said that innovative solutions were needed to improve the standard of Pacific peoples’ health.

“Health statistics tell us that the health of Pacific people can improve as we carry a disproportionate burden of disease. To address this, we need to share ideas and open dialogue among our health experts. GPS 2.0 provides a great opportunity for that,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

Hosted by Pasifika mental health organisation Le Va, the conference is a follow up to the 2012 Growing Pacific Solutions conference.

“The inaugural Growing Pacific Solutions conference in 2012 showed us there were many individuals, experts and organisations committed to improving the health and wellbeing of Pacific people. Two years on, it is a chance to build on those initial successes and work out the next step in improving the health and wellbeing of Pacific people,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

Over the course of the two-day conference, Pacific mental health, addictions, disabilities and other social sector experts will share ideas and showcase innovative and integrated solutions that meet the health needs of Pacific people.
