Health Minister Tony Ryall today opened a new $5 million satellite dialysis unit at Keneperu Hospital – greatly improving access to this lifesaving treatment for Greater Wellington communities.

“This 24-station unit will replace the current nine-station Porirua Community Dialysis Centre, and will meet growing demand in the area for this service," says Mr Ryall.

“This new unit will provide significantly improved capacity for local communities, and demonstrates the government's commitment to improving access to services for people with renal disease.

“The unit is additional to the ten-station dialysis unit in Wellington Regional Hospital, and is one of ten dialysis units that have either opened or undergone major redevelopment throughout the country over the past five years,” says Mr Ryall.

16 of the 24 stations will initially operate at the unit, with the remainder being commissioned as demand requires. The first patients will begin treatment on March 25, with up to 70 patients receiving dialysis treatment each week.

“There are about 240 dialysis patients in the Greater Wellington area, with the majority able to manage their care at home,” says Mr Ryall.

“For those that require additional support, this new facility will provide the best possible environment for patients who will come here three times a week, every week for treatment.

“The unit was built to specific New Zealand Building Code requirements which mean it could be operational to provide dialysis treatment within 24 hours following a major natural disaster.

“Part of the government’s long-term strategy is to provide better treatment services for dialysis, but it is important to note this plan is matched by an equally strong focus on prevention and transplantation,” says Mr Ryall.
