Fletcher Building CEO and managing director Mark Adamson has been appointed New Zealand’s representative on the Australian B20 Leadership Group, Finance Minister Bill English says.

The B20, or Business 20, runs parallel to the influential G20 – the group of 19 nations plus the European Union - which meets regularly to discuss ways to strengthen the global economy and create jobs.

Australia this year holds the G20 presidency and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has invited New Zealand to participate as a guest.

The B20 provides private sector input to G20 discussions and will hold a summit later this year in Sydney.  Mr Abbott and Prime Minister John Key have  announced an “Australasia Business Week” to showcase the Australasian  economy to G20 and B20 delegates visiting Sydney.

“I’m pleased that Mark Adamson has accepted nomination as New Zealand’s representative on the B20,” Mr English says.

“He not only leads New Zealand’s biggest listed company, but he also has extensive international corporate experience that he will bring to the table on behalf of New Zealand’s business community.”

B20 Australia chairman and Wesfarmers managing director Richard Goyder has also welcomed Mr Adamson’s appointment and says Australia’s G20 presidency allows a unique opportunity to showcase Australia and New Zealand to the world as a leading business destination.

“We look forward to the active involvement of New Zealand businesses in the B20 process this year,” Mr Goyder says.
