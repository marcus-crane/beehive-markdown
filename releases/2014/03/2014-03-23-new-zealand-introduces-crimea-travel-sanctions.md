Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will impose travel sanctions on selected individuals deemed to be responsible for the crisis in Ukraine. 

“New Zealand has made it clear that Russia’s actions regarding Ukraine and Crimea are unacceptable. We have confirmed that New Zealand will not recognise the outcome of the referendum in Crimea,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand will join with our partners to implement travel bans against specific Russian and Ukrainian individuals involved in the crisis.

“Applying sanctions will position New Zealand alongside other members of the international community who have condemned the breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“The sanctions will ban targeted individuals from obtaining visas to enter New Zealand. We will update and revise the list of those covered by the sanctions based on future developments.

"These travel sanctions are a modest and careful step designed to recognise the significance of the situation but leave room for further diplomatic work to take place.

“We continue to encourage Russia to behave in a manner consistent with its treaty obligations and the principles of international law, and call on all parties to take immediate steps to reduce tensions,” Mr McCully says.
