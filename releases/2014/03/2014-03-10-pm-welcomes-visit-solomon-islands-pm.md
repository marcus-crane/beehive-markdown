Prime Minister John Key has welcomed Solomon Islands Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo who arrived in New Zealand today.

“New Zealand and the Solomon Islands are close partners in the Pacific region and I am looking forward to seeing Prime Minister Lilo again,” says Mr Key.

“Last year I attended the 10th anniversary of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in Honiara and marked the transition of RAMSI from a military operation to a policing mission. This was a major milestone for the Solomon Islands and I am interested to hear about the progress that has been made since then.”

Mr Key says New Zealand maintains a significant aid programme in the Solomon Islands and this financial year New Zealand will contribute $37 million to programmes that support the development of critical infrastructure, fisheries, business, education, policing and revenue collection.

“The links between our two countries continue to go from strength to strength, in part driven by the Recognised Employer Scheme. Over 400 Solomon Islanders came to New Zealand last year,” says Mr Key.

Prime Minister Lilo will be in New Zealand from March 10-14.
