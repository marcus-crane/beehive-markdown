The Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon Peter Dunne, has announced the appointment of Maggie Burrill and Tina Wehipeihana-Wilson for a further term on the Lottery Grants Board. Mrs Burrill has been appointed for a three-year term and Ms Wehipeihana-Wilson for a two-year term.

The Board is established under the Gambling Act 2003 to distribute the profits of New Zealand lotteries, arising from activities such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno.

“The Lottery Grants Board distributes funds to Lottery Distribution committees which fund a range of projects and programmes and make a major contribution to communities throughout the country,” says Mr Dunne.

“The two appointees bring knowledge, experience and community connections, and will ensure the Board continues to be well-placed to do its work.” The appointments have immediate effect.
