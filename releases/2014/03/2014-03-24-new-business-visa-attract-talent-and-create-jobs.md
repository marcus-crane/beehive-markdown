A new business visa will encourage migrants to set up high-quality businesses and create new jobs, according to Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“Starting today, the new Entrepreneur Work Visa will help New Zealand attract talented, well-connected business people to invest and grow businesses in New Zealand,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The Entrepreneur Work Visa operates under a new points-based system that will result in higher quality, more productive businesses. It replaces the Long-Term Business Visa, which was attracting too many low quality applications.”

Mr Woodhouse says the new Visa offers extra points for expanding or starting businesses outside of the Auckland region, which remains the primary destination for new migrants to New Zealand.

“The inclusion of regional points is designed to encourage new potential investors to settle and grow new businesses across the country, and to share the benefit of the extra jobs these businesses create.”

Points will also be offered for a number of other criteria including job creation, export potential, and a minimum capital investment of $100,000 will be required.

“The Entrepreneur Work Visa significantly raises the bar to attract more innovative, export focused businesses to support economic growth and create jobs for all New Zealanders.
