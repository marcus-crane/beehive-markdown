Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins and Social Development Minister Paula Bennett have announced the transfer of migrant and refugee community development programme, Settling In, from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to the Office of Ethnic Affairs (OEA).

Settling In was established under MSD in 2004 to identify and address the social service needs of refugees and migrant communities, with the aim of supporting communities to develop their own solutions to settle with success.

Ms Collins say the transfer is fantastic news for the provision of migrant and refugee services.

“In New Zealand everyone has the ability to get ahead, stand on their own two feet and be a part of a nation that embraces cultural diversity,” says Ms Collins.

“Currently both OEA and Settling In work closely with refugee and migrant community groups on a range of projects arming them with the tools, connections and knowledge needed to thrive in New Zealand.

“Having Settling In services within OEA will enable closer sharing of these capabilities and more effective targeting of services to areas where they are most needed.

Ms Bennett says in recent years OEA’s work programme has flourished and has seen it establish a national and regional presence as a well-respected facilitator and service provider.

“This closer working relationship will ensure better tools and support for refugees and migrants to get involved, grow businesses, become leaders and make a contribution as New Zealanders”, Mrs Bennett says.

“We’re very proud of the success the Settling In programme has achieved over the past ten years under MSD, providing support in 14 locations across New Zealand,” both Ministers say.

The transfer will take effect in April 2014 and will see the funding provided for regional staff as well as a range of small grants to community organisations reallocated to the Office of Ethnic Affairs.
