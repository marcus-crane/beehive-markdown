Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is calling for applications for this year’s Support for Volunteering Fund.

“The fund provides over $502,000 each year to projects and organisations that promote and support volunteering in New Zealand,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The funding is divided between Volunteering New Zealand, regional volunteer centres and selected projects in the volunteer sector.

“We are looking to fund projects promoting information sharing, networking and development of resources that support Māori, Pacific and ethnic volunteering.

“We’re also interested in projects responding to specific cultural values and needs or encouraging, recognising and promoting volunteers as community leaders.”

Organisations applying for funds are required to have legal entity status, appropriate governance and management structures and processes in place.

Further information about the Support for Volunteering Fund and application forms are available at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) or calling 0800 824 824. Applications close Wednesday 7 May 2014.
