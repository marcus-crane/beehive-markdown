Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew says the New Zealand economy will benefit when all organisations achieve greater diversity in their leadership roles.

“I’m encouraging women who are ready for the challenges of a governance role, or are keen to take on more, to get in touch with the Ministry of Women’s Affairs,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The Government has committed to increasing women’s participation to 45 per cent on state sector boards and committees by 2014. Over the last eight years participation rates have ranged from 40.7 per cent to 42.3 per cent.

“To help reach this goal the Ministry of Women’s Affairs manages a database with over 800 women who are ready to serve on a board and further their governance career.

“We need to see skilled women working across a broader range of occupations, with a greater number in leadership and governance roles,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“By increasing women’s participation and having more diversity on boards, we can further grow our productive economy.

The database has recently gone through a review to ensure the CVs it holds are up-to-date and ready to be forwarded on when vacancies arise. Women interested in adding their CV, or submitting an updated version, can send them to [noms@mwa.govt.nz](mailto:noms@mwa.govt.nz) or visit [www.mwa.govt.nz/women-leadership](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/women-leadership)

The call to action comes ahead of International Women's Day on March 8th, which celebrates the social, political and economic achievements of women while encouraging further improvements.
