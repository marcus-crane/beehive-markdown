26 New Ministry for Primary Industries border staff begin training in Auckland today as part of a programme to beef up frontline resources, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

“Close to 125 new quarantine inspectors have joined MPI in the last 18 months and this is another big boost in resources.

“The 26 new staff will graduate around the middle of this year and will be posted around New Zealand.

“While there is increasing use of technology and intelligence to protect our border, we still need people on the frontline.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister because it is so important in protecting our economy. We know that unwanted pests and diseases can have devastating effects on our farmers and growers.

“In November last year 12 new x-ray machines were installed at New Zealand international airports. At the same time 32 new quarantine inspectors and five new detector dog handlers also graduated and joined the frontline.

“We also have the Government-Industry Agreements Deed signed off which allows industries to partner with MPI on decision making, costs, and responsibility in preparing for and responding to biosecurity incursions.”
