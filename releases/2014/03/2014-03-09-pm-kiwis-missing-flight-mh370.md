The Prime Minister has this afternoon acknowledged the anguish families of New Zealanders Paul Weeks and Ximin Wang will be going through, as the wait for news of the missing flight stretches to almost two days.

Mr Weeks and Mr Wang were the only two New Zealanders on board a Malaysian Airlines flight that disappeared between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing early on Saturday (NZT).

“This will be an almost unbearable wait for the families. Not knowing what has happened to the flight and their loved ones is an awful ordeal. While they will be hoping for a miracle, they will also be preparing themselves for the worst.

“There is nothing I can say to alleviate their pain, but they should know we are hoping and praying with them.

“The thoughts of New Zealanders everywhere are with them at this most distressing time.”
