A review of the future governance arrangements of Environment Canterbury is now underway, Local Government Minister Paula Bennett and Environment Minister Amy Adams announced today.

Commissioners were appointed in 2010 following a critical external review of Environment Canterbury’s performance. Last year commissioner governance was extended until 2016 to protect the gains the commissioners have made.

A review of the arrangements to commence on 1 March 2014 was built into the Environment Canterbury (Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management) Amendment Bill 2010 when it was recently amended to ensure Canterbury’s future regional governance arrangements could be carefully considered.

Ms Adams says the Commissioners, under the leadership of Dame Margaret Bazley, have proved highly effective.

“There have been significant improvements in the establishment of local relationships, freshwater management, and resource consent timelines,” Ms Adams says.

“As Christchurch and the Canterbury region continue to recover from the devastating earthquakes, we need to provide on-going social and economic stability.”

“This review is about looking at the future requirements for Environment Canterbury’s governance, membership and resource management arrangements when the current Commissioners finish their term in 2016,” Mrs Bennett says.

The review aims to be completed by December 2014. It will include discussions with key stakeholders, including the Canterbury Mayoral Forum, and public consultation with the people of Canterbury.

The Government will be releasing a discussion document in the coming months.

The review will also include Environment Canterbury’s relationship with territorial authorities in Canterbury and Ngāi Tahu, and its role in Canterbury Earthquake recovery.

The review will be carried out jointly by the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry for the Environment.
