Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says a Royal New Zealand Air Force P3 Orion will relocate to Australia to continue searching for the missing Malaysian MH370 flight.

“New Zealand is committed to playing our part in the international search effort for the missing MH370 flight. Our thoughts remain with the families who are waiting for news on their loved ones,” says Dr Coleman.

“At the request of Malaysia, New Zealand’s RNZAF P3 Orion will today relocate to the Royal Australian Air Force base Pearce, north of Perth, to join Australian, US and Chinese aircraft in the search effort of the southern corridor area.

“The Air Force’s upgraded P-3K2 Orion is an ideal option for search missions like this. It has state of the art sensors, can fly at low levels and remain airborne more than 12 hours.”
