ACC Minister Judith Collins says substantial levy cuts for employers and workers take effect tomorrow as a result of the Scheme’s excellent performance over the last few years.

“Tomorrow marks the fortieth birthday of the Accident Compensation scheme and it’s great that New Zealanders will be celebrating by keeping more money in their pockets,” Ms Collins says.

“From 1 April the average New Zealand household can expect to keep just over $200 extra each year. Small businesses will be around $180 better off annually and larger employers will receive, on average, a $6,000 reduction.

“ACC has been working hard to rebuild New Zealanders’ trust and confidence in the Scheme which is almost fully funded. It’s fantastic that this year Kiwis will be $387 million better off as a result.”

Ms Collins says as well as ACC’s consistent investment and financial performance, the Corporation has made genuine improvements in the way it rehabilitates injured New Zealanders back to independence.

“ACC has announced an updated and expanded approach to its injury prevention work, is continuing to embed robust privacy practices and new technologies and processes to help it improve customer service,” Ms Collins says.

“I’ve also recently announced better access, choice and prices for hearing loss treatment and a new sexual violence prevention programme in schools promoting healthier relationships.

“It’s important the Scheme is not only financially sound, but is trusted to support Kiwis when they need it. I’m pleased to see New Zealanders remain at the heart of everything ACC does.”
