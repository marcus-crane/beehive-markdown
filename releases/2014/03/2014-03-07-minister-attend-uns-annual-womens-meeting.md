Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew will travel to New York tomorrow for the 58th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).

“CSW is the principal global policy making body dedicated exclusively to gender equality and the advancement of women,” says Mrs Goodhew.

This year’s theme is *challenges and achievements in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for women and girls*.

“New Zealand has a strong reputation internationally on gender equality. This is an opportunity to share our work to improve the lives of women across our region, and to learn from other nations,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew will also visit community organisations that work in specific areas of her Women’s Affairs and Community Voluntary Sector Portfolios.

“I am also interested to learn about the experiences and challenges of those working in the areas of education and employment for young mothers and sustainable community development,” says Mrs Goodhew.

**Notes:**

- New Zealand supports internationally-recognised global goals and targets, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), to reduce poverty and improve lives around the world.
- The MDGs were agreed by 189 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit in September 2000. As the goals apply to developing countries, New Zealand's role is to work with Pacific partners to achieve the MDGs and international development targets.
- The MDGs were set to 2015. The United Nations is currently co-ordinating a Post 2015 Development Agenda.
