An accord between the newly established $100 million NEXT Foundation and the Government was signed in Nelson today by Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith.

“The NEXT Foundation is an incredible deed of generosity which has the potential to deliver huge steps forward for conservation in New Zealand. This Accord is about providing the right framework for DOC to partner with the Foundation and to ensure we maximise the conservation gains from this huge investment,” Dr Smith says.

“There are two key elements to the Accord. The first is in ensuring these funds go to new projects that are out and above the work the Government would have ordinarily done. The second is in providing a commitment that the conservation gains are maintained into the future.

“This Accord builds on the very successful partnership of Project Janszoon. We have shown what is possible in the Abel Tasman National Park through that project and now want to formalise the partnership to enable other game-changing conservation initiatives around the country.

“This Accord with the NEXT Foundation is part of DOC’s new direction of partnering with businesses and community groups to protect New Zealand’s special places and species for future generations.”
