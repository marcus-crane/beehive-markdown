Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today announced the members of a New Zealand Smart Grid Forum to advance the development of smart electricity networks in New Zealand.

“The term ‘smart grid’ encompasses all the challenges and opportunities for our electricity system presented by emerging technologies and changing consumer preferences,” Mr Bridges says. 

“Future electricity systems will need to be smarter to respond to those different demands. 

“The new Smart Grid Forum will provide a platform for information-sharing about these new challenges and opportunities, as well as providing advice on the deployment of a smart grid in New Zealand.

“It reflects the Government’s commitment to the responsible and savvy use of resources and technology to secure New Zealand’s energy future and lift our standard of living.

“The significant response to an invitation for prospective forum members to register their interest confirms the time for this initiative is right. 

“Members were selected from a range of criteria including the need for representation from leaders across all parts of the electricity system, including consumers, as well as business, scientific and academic interests.

“I’d like to thank those who put their hand up and I look forward to the contribution they will make in helping to shape a common vision for our future power system,” Mr Bridges says.
