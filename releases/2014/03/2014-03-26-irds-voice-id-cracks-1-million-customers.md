Revenue Minister Todd McClay is thrilled with the success of IRD’s Voice ID service after it cracked 1 million customers today, saving taxpayers a staggering 8,500 hours of phone time each year.

“This is a significant achievement. At 1 million enrolments we have the highest level of voice biometric enrolments per capita in the world,” says Mr McClay.

“Leading the way in voice biometrics highlights the Government’s commitment to reducing red tape and compliance for New Zealanders.”

Voice ID went live in January 2012 and has proven so successful that around 60-70 per cent of people who call IRD on any given day are now enrolled with it.

“I am advised that customers are saving around 40 seconds per call when enrolled through Voice ID. This equates to a staggering 8,500 hours each year New Zealanders no longer have to spend on the phone to IRD.”

Signing up for Voice ID eliminates the need to answer a lot of personal security questions to verify who you are, meaning you will have your query dealt with quicker.

Voice ID also allows customers to automatically check the balance of their Inland Revenue accounts, receive child support information, track their tax refund, retrieve their IRD number, activate their online services account and reset passwords, even if they call outside opening hours.

“The Government’s push for better public services reflects our belief that New Zealanders deserve to deal with government easily, securely and in a timely fashion. Voice ID is another tool we use to achieve that,” says Mr McClay.
