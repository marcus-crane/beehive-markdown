A programme that has assisted vulnerable households with emergency repairs for earthquake damage will be used to assist those affected by the flooding currently impacting on Greater Christchurch, says Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

Mr Brownlee, who has travelled to Christchurch today to look at how the Crown can assist the Christchurch City Council-led response to the flooding, has directed that the existing Winter Make it Right programme be made available to help those with housing issues that will need addressing but are not emergencies.

The programme is a joint effort with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) and Community Energy Action working with partners including Fletcher Construction to provide repairs.

“People should continue to contact the emergency services in the first instance if they have urgent issues affecting them and their homes arising from the current weather event,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) will be working with the emergency services to identify situations where the Winter Make it Right programme may be able to kick in after the initial response and contractors working with the programme can respond in the aftermath of this weather event.”

“Where there are earthquake issues that have been exacerbated by the weather, or new issues that have arisen which are not urgent but need attention, we encourage people to contact 0800 777 846 so that we can find solutions for them.”

The Winter Make it Right programme has previously co-ordinated contractors to assist with repairs to dozens of earthquake damaged homes to make them weather-tight and safe for the occupants.

Fletcher Construction has confirmed it will commit resourcing to the programme, while other companies with prominent roles in the earthquake recovery, Hawkins and Downer, will also assist.

   

“I have also asked CERA to provide assistance where it can to support the Christchurch City Council and other agencies in the flooding response,” Mr Brownlee says.

“CERA is contacting those people still living in the Residential Red Zone that are working towards settling with the Crown to check on them and to assist with referrals to other support agencies if required. If they cannot be reached by phone, CERA staff will be visiting their homes to check on them.”

“CERA’s geotech engineers are also working with council staff and other experts to assess what effect this weather event is having on the Port Hills, and if any further steps need to be taken to mitigate any risks that are identified.”
