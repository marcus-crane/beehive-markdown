Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today announced $26 million of methamphetamine or ‘P’ was stopped from reaching New Zealand’s streets following a series of targeted operations in late 2013.

From August to November, Customs intercepted 11.5kg of methamphetamine and about 117kg of precursors that included 91.5kg of Contac NT, and just over 17.5kg of iodine, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.

“The target operations led to 129 interceptions in total and 22 arrests.  Major hauls included multiple kilos of methamphetamine located in suitcases and significant amounts of precursor drugs hidden inside different types of machinery and everyday household items,” Mr Williamson says.

It’s estimated the community harm avoided from the interceptions was $13 million.

“Tackling methamphetamine is a top priority for this Government and we will do everything it takes to disrupt this vile trade by taking down individuals and syndicates involved in it.

“Customs will also adjust its operational techniques to counter changing smuggling methods criminals use.  New ideas and approaches are always being developed to complement sophisticated intelligence tools already used.

Customs will run further targeted operations this year.
