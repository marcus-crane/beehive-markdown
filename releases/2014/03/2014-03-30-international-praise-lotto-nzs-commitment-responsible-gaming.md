Internal Affairs Minister Hon Peter Dunne today announced that Lotto New Zealand has received international recognition for its commitment to providing a safe gaming environment. 

Lotto New Zealand’s responsible gaming programme has been officially certified to Level 3, out of four possible levels, by the World Lottery Association under its Responsible Gaming Framework. 

“Lotto New Zealand provides safe lottery and gaming products that allows New Zealanders to play and win while contributing money back to the community. This international certification is a testament to the focus that Lotto New Zealand places on providing a gaming environment that encourages responsible play and on continually improving the services they provide their players,” says Mr Dunne 

Lotto New Zealand is one of just two lotteries in the Asia Pacific region to receive Level 3 certification for its responsible gaming programme. On-going work to continuously improve its practice has elevated its programme from Level 2 in 2009. 

Recent initiatives introduced to strengthen Lotto New Zealand’s responsible gaming programme include dedicated problem gambling training for retailers and the introduction of additional tools and information in-store for customers.

“In 2013, Lotto New Zealand transferred over $200 million to the Lottery Grants Board for community purposes. Lottery funding is the major source of funding for Creative New Zealand, Sport New Zealand, the New Zealand Film Commission, and more than 3,000 community organisations and projects each year.

“This speaks highly about the way Lotto NZ provides safe gaming products that millions of New Zealanders enjoy every week while at the same time making a significant financial contribution to a vast array of sporting, cultural and heritage activities in our communities. 

Lotto NZ is to be congratulated in receiving this international endorsement that recognises this high practice standard and contribution,” says Mr Dunne.   

**Background information:**

**About the World Lottery Association (WLA):** The WLA is a member-based organisation that sets the international benchmark for responsible gaming. The WLA represents over 140 member lotteries from 90 countries on five continents. WLA membership is exclusive and requires adherence to a responsible gaming code of conduct. 

**The WLA’s Responsible Gaming Framework:** To obtain certification, member lotteries submit their responsible gaming programmes for review by an Independent Assessment Panel made up of international experts from the field of corporate social responsibility.

Each programme is assessed on 10 core elements: research, employee education, retailer training and support, game design, online gaming, advertising and marketing, player  education, treatment referral, stakeholder engagement, and reporting and measurement. 

Level 3 certification denotes a responsible programme with strong planning, development and implementation of responsible gaming initiatives.
