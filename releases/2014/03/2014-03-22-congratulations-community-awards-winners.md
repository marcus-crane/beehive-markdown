Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has this evening congratulated Mistletoe Bay Trust on winning the supreme award at the Trustpower National Community Awards and the Neurological Foundation Southern Chair of Neurosurgery for receiving the runner-up award.

“Each year, more than a million kiwis give their time, effort and energy to their communities for free. These annual Awards are our chance to recognise and thank dedicated volunteers for their contribution,” says Mrs Goodhew

“I acknowledge Trustpower for their continued support of the National Community Awards, volunteer managers, community leaders, other corporate supporters and of course, the volunteers themselves. They all play an important part in creating the safe and inclusive communities that make New Zealand a great place to live.”

The Awards were announced this evening at the 2013 Trustpower National Community Awards Dinner, held at Stadium Southland.

“Supreme Winner Mistletoe Bay Trust was representing the Marlborough District. The Trust set up an eco-village and campground within the Marlborough Sounds. It is much more than a place to stay, it is an experience,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Representing Dunedin was the runner-up, The Neurological Foundation Southern Chair of Neurosurgery. The Foundation drove an awareness and fundraising campaign to ensure local neurosurgical services would continue.

“I commend the 25 participating regional finalists for their outstanding efforts and achievements. All are shining examples of the amazing work volunteers undertake every day in cities and districts across New Zealand.”
