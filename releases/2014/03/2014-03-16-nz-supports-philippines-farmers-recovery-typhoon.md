Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that New Zealand will provide $2.5 million to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help farmers in the Philippines recover from Typhoon Haiyan.

“Typhoon Haiyan was one of the most devastating storms in recent history and it is estimated that almost 6 million workers’ livelihoods were destroyed, lost or disrupted,” Ms Kaye says.

“In the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan New Zealand made around $5 million available to support the emergency response and relief effort and the New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully indicated that we would consider further support aimed at helping the Philippines recover.

“New Zealand’s contribution will help to restore the livelihoods of 128,000 vulnerable households in rural areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan.

“The FAO programme will focus on crops (rice and corn), coconuts, forestry, livestock (pigs, poultry and buffalo) and fisheries restoration. It will see seeds, tools and livestock distributed to farmers, as well as providing training in agricultural techniques.

“Over time the aim is to increase agricultural production, secure and diversify food sources, improve technical knowledge and establish a pre-emergency level of income for affected households.

“New Zealand knows first-hand how hard responding to natural disasters can be. We also understand that supporting individuals to restore their livelihoods is critical to the long-term recovery of communities,” Ms Kaye says.

Today’s announcement takes New Zealand’s total contribution to the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan to around $7.5 million.

Minister Kaye is currently in the Philippines. She will also visit China and return to New Zealand next weekend.
