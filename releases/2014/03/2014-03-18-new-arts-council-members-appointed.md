Thirteen inaugural members have been appointed to the new Arts Council, established by the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 2014, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“I am delighted with the calibre of the members who have made themselves available for the new Arts Council,” Mr Finlayson said. “The new Council has a good balance between members of the previous entities and new blood. It also has a wide representation which reflects the diversity and breadth of the arts in New Zealand.”

The new Arts Council commences on 1 May 2014 and replaces three statutory boards and a statutory committee under previous legislation. The Arts Council will continue to operate under the name Creative New Zealand.

The Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 2014 Act streamlines the governance of Creative New Zealand. The Act addresses the previous overly complex structure consisting of four governing boards with 28 members, and replaces it with a single governance body with 13 members.

The single Arts Council will be responsible for policy, strategy and funding allocation, replacing the previous division of responsibilities between the Arts Council, the Arts Board, Te Waka Toi and the Pacific Arts Committee.

The new Arts Council must have a minimum of four members with knowledge of Māori Arts, tea o Māori (a Māori world view) and tikanga Māori (Māori protocol and culture). These members are appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage in consultation with the Minister of Māori Affairs.

Two members are appointed with knowledge of the arts, and the traditions or cultures, of the Pacific Island peoples of New Zealand, in consultation with the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs.
