Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the establishment of two new schools to cater for the growing population in Rolleston.

“I want to thank the Rolleston, Lincoln and surrounding communities for their involvement and valuable input into the consultation process held last year,” says Ms Parata.

“This Government continues to work hard in our investment of $1 billion over the next 10 years to restore and renew the education environment in greater Christchurch - there is excellent momentum!”

The new primary school, which will be located in West Rolleston, will cater for Year 1-8 students, and will open in 2016. The new secondary school will be located in the Rolleston recreation precinct, and will open in 2017. It will cater for Year 9-13 students. Both schools will open with students in the lower year levels only, and will introduce all year levels in subsequent years.

“The Government recognises that the population in the Rolleston area is growing. The new schools will take pressure off neighbouring state schools, particularly Clearview Primary School, Rolleston School and Lincoln High School,” says Ms Parata.

“Both new schools will be 21st century schools with modern learning environments and flexible learning areas. They will ensure a great education for children and young people in the Rolleston area.”

The Ministry of Education will now seek nominations from members of the community to be appointed to the Establishment Boards of Trustees for the new schools. Each Board will have five members appointed by the Minister of Education.

Each Establishment Board will develop its new school’s charter and have input into the school design. It will also appoint the principal and staff, and work with its community to build a vision and school culture which supports learning and achievement for all its students.
