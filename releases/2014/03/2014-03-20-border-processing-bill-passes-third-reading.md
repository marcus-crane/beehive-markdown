A Bill that supports the implementation of a new border management system has passed its third and final reading in Parliament today.

Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says the Border Processing (Trade Single Window and Duties) Bill amends the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the Biosecurity Act 1993 to support implementation of the trade single window component of the Joint Border Management System.

The trade single window provides a single channel for importers and exporters to comply with border requirements, which will improve the flow of trade and reduce compliance costs over time.

“The amendments in the Act cover registration of Joint Border Management System users, sending and receiving information to and from the trade single window, and consequential changes to offences and penalties.

“Two new amendments have been incorporated to make consultation over any changes to the de minimis mandatory, and remove doubt around the setting of the biosecurity levy rate,” Mr Williamson says.
