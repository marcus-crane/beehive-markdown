Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will attend the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) in London this week before travelling to Europe and South East Asia.

Mr McCully was appointed Deputy Chair of CMAG at last year’s meeting of Commonwealth leaders.

“New Zealand is an active member of the Commonwealth and is committed to ensuring the organisation continues to play a meaningful role in international affairs,” Mr McCully says.

“This involves pushing for reforms to make the organisation more focused and effective, particularly around governance and human rights.”

Mr McCully will meet United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague before meeting other fellow foreign ministers in Andorra, Spain, Poland and Germany.

“This visit is an excellent opportunity to get a regional perspective on events in Ukraine, discuss a free trade agreement with the EU and further New Zealand’s bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.”

Mr McCully will then travel to Singapore, Viet Nam and Laos for talks with his counterparts.
