Education Minister Hekia Parata says that it is a credit to the quality of our education system that nearly 20 Ministers of Education from the top performing education systems around the world are coming to New Zealand later this month to attend the International Summit on the Teaching Profession.

“This is the ‘world cup’ of education,” Ms Parata says, “and our bid to host this prestigious summit was well received, and is being well supported.”

Education Ministers, heads of teacher unions and teacher leaders from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) highest achieving countries around the globe will gather in Wellington on 28-29 March to attend the 4th International Summit on the Teaching Profession (Summit).

The confirmed Minister-led delegations are:

- Canada                       Minister Jeff Johnson
- China, Hong Kong    Minister Eddie Ng Hak-kim
- Denmark                     Minister Christine Antorini
- Estonia                        Minister Jaak Aaviksoo
- Finland                        Minister Krista Kiuru
- Germany                     Vice President of Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lander in the Federal Republic of Germany, Minister Stephan Dorgerloh
- Japan                          Vice Minister Shinichi Yamanaka
- Netherlands               Minister Jet Bussmaker
- Poland                         Undersecretary of State Ewa Dudek
- Sweden                       State Secretary Bertil Ostberg
- UK                                Minister Michael Russell
- USA                             Secretary Arne Duncan

The Summit is jointly hosted by the Education Minister of the host country, the OECD and Education International. It was initiated by United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan in 2011, and is focused on strengthening the teaching profession and raising student achievement. 

This year, the Summit theme is ‘*Excellence, equity and inclusiveness – high quality teaching for all’*.

“The Summit is a great opportunity for the top performing education systems to share their successes and their challenges, and learn from each other. I am delighted that there Ministers from around the world have prioritised this summit and confirmed their attendance,” Ms Parata says.

“This year’s New Zealand delegation will again include the President of the NZEI, Judith Nowotarski and President of the PPTA, Angela Roberts. Tom Parsons, as both an outstanding teacher leader as Principal of Queen Charlotte College and President of SPANZ, completes the New Zealand delegation,” Ms Parata says.

“Hosting the Summit is a part of our Government’s comprehensive quality teaching agenda, and the theme reflects the longstanding challenge our system has of raising even higher the achievement of our best and brightest students, while also lifting those who are being left behind.

“As host for the Summit, I have taken the opportunity to strengthen our regional education links by including, as honoured guests and observers, our Pacific education ministers as we all look to raising Pasifika student achievement whether here in New Zealand or in our neighbouring Pacific nations.

“Other elements of our comprehensive quality teaching agenda include:

- the establishment of the new professional body, the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand (EDUCANZ), which replaces the NZ Teachers Council and is the cornerstone of the quality teaching agenda;
- the announcement by the Prime Minister of the $359 million investment in professional career pathways over the next four years that will support teachers and principals to lift student achievement in every school;
- the inaugural Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards in June;
- the education festivals in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch to coincide with the Summit;
- and the new post graduate qualifications being offered from this year.

“This National-led Government has an unrelenting focus on giving all our young people a better education. It is important that we publicly acknowledge the powerful contribution the teaching profession makes to lifting overall student achievement.”
