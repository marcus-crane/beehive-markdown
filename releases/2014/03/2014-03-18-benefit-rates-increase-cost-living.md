Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says benefit and superannuation payments to more than a million New Zealanders will increase on April 1.

“In 2011 the Government legislated to make sure benefit and superannuation payments increase each year alongside increases to the consumer price index,” Mrs Bennett said.

“This means rates and thresholds applying to a range of Work and Income and StudyLink assistance will rise to match the increase in living costs.”

The Annual General Adjustment will see a 1.38 per cent increase to:

- benefit rates, Student Allowances, Student Loan Living Costs and the Foster Care Allowance,
- rates and thresholds for supplementary assistance, and
- thresholds for the Community Services Card.

Superannuation and Veteran’s Pension Payments will also go up by 2.66 per cent, in line with the Government’s commitment to keep the married couple rate at least 66 per cent of the average wage. 

This will mean around $14.60 extra each week for married superannuitants and $9.50 a week for those living alone compared to increases made on 1 April 2013.
