Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Jan Henderson as New Zealand’s first High Commissioner to Barbados.

“The High Commission in Bridgetown, co-located with the British High Commission, is New Zealand’s first diplomatic post in the Caribbean,” Mr McCully says.

“It is accredited to a number of states and is important for liaising with the two major regional bodies - the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).

“New Zealand and Barbados have long-standing Commonwealth ties.  Through our involvement in the Pacific Islands Forum it has become apparent that we face similar regional challenges. From renewable energy to disaster risk management, New Zealand has relevant experience to share with Caribbean nations.

“Sharing space with another country’s diplomatic mission is a cost effective way to increase New Zealand’s offshore representation and I expect it to be a more regular feature of New Zealand diplomacy.”

Ms Henderson has previously served as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to India and Ambassador to Turkey, Jordan and Israel.
