Associate Minister for Primary Industries Jo Goodhew has tonight paid tribute to the best of the best in Kiwi timber engineering and building design.

“Innovative designs in wood are giving us a whole new kind of building. The best of what is being built today is strong, sustainable and thermally sound.”

Mrs Goodhew made the comments during the presentation of the Ministry for Primary Industries Supreme Judges’ Choice Award at the NZ Wood Resene Timber Design Awards 2014.

“These awards are a great occasion to celebrate our innovative approach to timber. From the early days when it was all about weatherboard, and gib board, to today when engineered wood products are setting the scene for structures that are strong, beautiful and original.

“Engineered timber can now be used where once steel or concrete were the only option; and wood in general performs well in other areas such as acoustics, and thermal performance,” says Mrs Goodhew.

All 2014 finalists demonstrated these qualities of wood and all of these finalists were eligible for selection for the supreme award.

“It is testament to the calibre of finalists this year that the decision on a winner for the Supreme Judges’ Choice Award was very difficult. In the end the award was shared between two: Coastlands Aquatic Centre and Taieri Mouth Bach,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Coastlands Aquatic Centre on the Kapiti Coast features a 2000 square metre curved transparent roof. The Taieri Mouth Bach is a 21st century interpretation of a bach and was built in eight weeks.
