Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has congratulated Ministry of Social Development staff for donating more than $1 million through payroll giving – becoming the first government department to do so.

“This million-dollar milestone is an exceptional achievement by MSD staff and shows their willingness to make a difference for the communities they live in and work with, beyond the call of duty,” Mrs Bennett said.

The Government introduced payroll giving in 2010 as a simple, straightforward way for people to give back, without worrying about filing tax returns or dealing with complicated paperwork

More than $15 million has been donated by New Zealanders through the scheme so far.

Employees nominate a registered charity, school, church or other approved organisation, and their employer sets up a direct payment each payday, sorting the tax at the same time.

“Since MSD began taking part in the scheme in April 2010, almost 30,000 donations have been made by staff, contributing around $10,000 a fortnight,” Mrs Bennett said.

Organisations receiving donations include the NZ Red Cross, Kidscan and World Vision, as well as schools, churches and many other organisations.

Staff also used payroll giving to donate generously to relief agencies following the Pike River mine disaster, the Christchurch and Japanese earthquakes, and recent storms in the Pacific and the Philippines.

“These donations are going directly back to the community, helping to support people and families in need,” Mrs Bennett said.

“I’m proud MSD is leading the way with payroll giving and acknowledge every staff member who has contributed – by doing so they are making a difference.”
