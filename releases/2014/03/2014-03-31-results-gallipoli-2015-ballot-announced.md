New Zealanders who entered the Gallipoli 2015 ballot to attend the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landings will be notified from today whether they have been successful, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse has announced.

“The 1915 ANZAC campaign helped shape New Zealand’s identity. The centenary commemorations next year will be especially poignant and a time for New Zealanders both abroad and at home to reflect,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The significance of Gallipoli to New Zealand is evident by the overwhelming interest in the ballot.”

A total of 9851 applicants were entered in the ballot, with 950 double passes (1900 places) available. One hundred ‘special passes’ were held back from the ballot to be issued to youth and other representatives at a later date.

“Of the 950 double passes available, 251 (26%) were won by direct descendants of those who fought at Gallipoli, 149 (16%) by veterans, and 550 (58%) by members of the general public,” said Mr Woodhouse.

“This result reflects the public consultation undertaken in 2012 that a cross-section of contemporary New Zealanders are able to participate in these commemorations, with special places available for descendants of Gallipoli veterans, and veterans of other conflicts”.

One hundred double passes were allocated in each of the direct descendant and veteran categories. Those unsuccessful in those categories were then placed in the general public category for attendance passes. A wait list for the reallocation of forfeited attendance passes has also been created.

“With such high demand and limited places, there will no doubt be many people disappointed at not being successful in the ballot.” 

Mr Woodhouse says the Government is considering holding a second New Zealand service at Gallipoli in August 2015, and an approach has now been made to the Turkish authorities. Further announcements will be made as details are confirmed.

Emails will be sent to all applicants from today advising of the ballot outcome with follow-up letters posted in the coming week. Successful pass holders will be able to access their online account, or contact the Gallipoli 2015 call centre, to update their details from 5pm.

Unsuccessful pass holders who elected to go on the wait list can update their contact details by contacting the Gallipoli 2015 call centre. Those who wish to find their position on the wait list should email [info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz](mailto:info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz).
