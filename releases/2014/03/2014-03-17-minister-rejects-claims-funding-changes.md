Education Minister Hekia Parata has rejected claims that the Government is looking to fund schools according to student performance.

“That is simply not true,” Ms Parata says.

“I met with each of the unions and sector groups two weeks ago and clarified these matters with them directly. I am disappointed that despite this the NZEI has persisted with their claims.

“It is usual process after every Census for the Ministry of Education to calculate new decile rankings for the county's 2500 schools. The Ministry of Education is yet to receive the 2013 Census data. 

Decile funding, which accounts for 12 percent of school funding, is not based on student’s performance. A school’s decile indicates the extent to which the school draws its students from low socio-economic communities.

“I have received a lot of feedback from the education sector that the decile funding system could be improved but, any changes would have to be well thought through, be well foreshadowed and would require a lot of discussion and work alongside the profession and sector groups.”

Ms Parata says The Government’s focus this year continues to be on progressing the quality teaching agenda. 

“This includes work on the $359m investment in career pathways for teaching professionals, establishing the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand (EDUCANZ) which will replace the existing New Zealand Teachers Council, reviewing professional development provision, hosting the International Summit on the Teaching Profession and holding education festivals in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch,” Ms Parata says.
