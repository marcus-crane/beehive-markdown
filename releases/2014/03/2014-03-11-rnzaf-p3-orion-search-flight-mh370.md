Prime Minister John Key says a Royal New Zealand Air Force P3 Orion will soon be joining the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370.

“The Malaysian Government has accepted the New Zealand offer to join the international search and rescue effort, and I will be talking to Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib tonight to reinforce that New Zealand stands firmly alongside Malaysia at this challenging time” says Mr Key.

“The aircraft departed yesterday and, after a stop-off in Darwin, will arrive in Malaysia later today.  It is expected to join the multi-national search and rescue mission.

“The New Zealand aircraft will be based at the Butterworth air base in Penang along with two Australian P3 planes.  They are likely to assist Malaysian authorities by searching the sea areas North of Malaysia.

“Much remains unclear about what has happened to the flight.  New Zealand wants to do its part in the search and rescue effort to locate the aircraft,” says Mr Key.

“While we are aware the hope for positive news is fading, our thoughts remain with the family members of those who were on the flight, particularly the families of New Zealanders Paul Weeks and Ximin Wang.”
