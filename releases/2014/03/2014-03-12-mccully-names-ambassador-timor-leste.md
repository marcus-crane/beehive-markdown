Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Jonathan Schwass as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Timor-Leste.

“Since 1999 New Zealand has played a major role in building Timor-Leste’s peace and security.  The country has come a long way in a short time and is now moving into an era in which development, particularly sustainable economic development, is the major priority,” Mr McCully says.

“The new High Commissioner will be responsible for ensuring this important relationship is further strengthened through business and trade links as well as New Zealand’s aid programme.”

Timor-Leste plans to open an Embassy in New Zealand later this year.

Mr Schwass has previously served as Deputy High Commissioner in Solomon Islands.
