Minister for Whanau Ora Tariana Turia announced today that the organisation Te Putahitanga o Te Waipounamu will be the Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency for the South Island.

Te Putahitanga o Te Waipounamu is a partnership of nine South Island iwi who have a strong history of working with their whanau in Te Waipounamu,” says Minister Turia.

“I am excited by the expertise and experience of this organisation to help build the capacity of whanau in Te Waipounamu and empower them to create their own pathways, take back control of their lives, set achievable goals and plan for their futures,” says Minister Turia.

This is the second of three announcements for the non-government organisations who will operate as Whanau Ora Commissioning Agencies around the country. The Pasifika Medical Association under the banner Pasifika Futures was announced last week as the Pasifika focused Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency. The Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency for the North Island will be announced in due course.

The following nine iwi of the South Island comprise the Shareholder Council of Te Putahitanga o Te Waipounamu:

- Ngati Apa ki Te Ra To Charitable Trust
- Ngati Koata Trust
- Te Runanga o Ngati Rarua
- Ngati Tama ki Te Waipounamu Trust
- Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Maui Trust
- Te Runanga a Rangitane o Wairau Charitable Trust
- Te Runanga o Ngati Kuia Charitable Trust
- Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu
