Trade Minister Tim Groser and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy are leading an agribusiness delegation to Chile and Colombia from 23-28 March.

“Latin America is a valued trading partner for New Zealand and a fast growing region,” says Mr Groser. 

“Our relationship with Chile is thriving with a high level of engagement in areas such as energy and environment, agriculture and education. They are encouraging New Zealand business to explore future investment opportunities and we hope to build on this.

“In Colombia we are aiming to build a greater understanding of the market, through a range of farm visits and meetings with local Ministers and authorities.”

The overall visit will be centred on a Field Days event in southern Chile, where more than 40 New Zealand brands will be demonstrating their products to farmers, buyers and distributors in a dedicated New Zealand farm technology promotion.

“New Zealand is a significant investor in Chile’s agricultural sector, having invested $630 million since 2007. We believe this relationship will continue to strengthen over time,” says Mr Guy.

“This is my third visit to the region in the last 12 months, including a successful visit with the Prime Minister last year. This is recognition of the importance New Zealand places on Latin America.

“We are well placed as a leader in agribusiness to provide a full range of expertise, products and services.

“There is a large amount of productive agricultural land in Colombia, and a real interest from New Zealand businesses in investing in Colombia. A major focus for us will be working toward greater collaboration in growing their agricultural sector.

“In October last year I was proud to welcome 170 farmers from Colombia who visited New Zealand on a study tour, getting first-hand insight into New Zealand’s pastoral farming systems and agritechnology.”
