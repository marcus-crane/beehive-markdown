Nominations are now open for the 2014 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards - celebrating the service of New Zealand’s health volunteers.

“These awards recognise the dedicated volunteers who are a valued part of New Zealand’s public health service,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The first Minister of Health Volunteer Awards held last year drew more than 90 nominations, and I hope to see even more this year.

“Last year’s awards recipients ranged in age from 14 to 85. Their inspiring stories highlighted the commitment, dedication and hard work undertaken by many volunteers to improve the quality of lives of New Zealanders.

“From running a hospital shop, to creating te reo Māori resources on injury prevention, to supporting young people diagnosed with arthritis – these are the people who make a real difference to our health services every day,” says Mr Ryall.

Last year’s Youth Health Volunteer Award recipient was Matthew Wadham. Matthew said he was surprised by his award, given in recognition of his work supporting children with arthritis at an annual Arthritis NZ camp.

“After being diagnosed with arthritis himself at age 10, Matthew saw his role as helping young people by inspiring them with his story. He said he felt as if he was just giving to the kids what he would want if he was in their position,” says Mr Ryall.

“If you know an individual or group of people like Matthew, who make a difference by giving their time to help others, I encourage you to nominate them,” says Mr Ryall.

Nominations for this year’s awards open today and close 17 April 2014. Winners will be presented during National Volunteer Week from 15-21 June 2014.

This year also sees the inclusion of a new category for long service and an overall Health Volunteer of the Year award.
