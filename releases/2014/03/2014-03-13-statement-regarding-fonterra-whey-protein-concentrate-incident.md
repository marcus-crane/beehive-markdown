Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye said today that she received notification from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) at 3.30pm yesterday that they had laid charges in the Wellington District Court against Fonterra.

“As the matter is before the court, it is inappropriate for Ministers to make any comment regarding these charges and the compliance investigation,” Ms Kaye says.

“It is important to note that the compliance investigation has been run by the regulator (MPI), and has been independent from Ministers.”

MPI has issued a media statement regarding this. All questions regarding the compliance investigation conducted by MPI and the charges should be directed to Deputy Director General Compliance and Response Andrew Coleman.
