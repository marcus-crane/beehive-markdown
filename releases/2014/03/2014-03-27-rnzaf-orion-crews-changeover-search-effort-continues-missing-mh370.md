Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman acknowledges the hard work of the New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion crew who are today handing over to a new crew who will continue searching for missing Malaysian MH370 flight.

“I would like to thank the crew of the RNZAF Orion who have worked tirelessly during the last 18 days, playing their part in the international search effort. They have done a thoroughly professional job,” says Dr Coleman.

“The crew has flown a total of 105 hours, completed 36 hours on search, and have covered a search area which is more than one and a half times the size of New Zealand.

“New Zealand remains committed to supporting Australia who are co-ordinating the search effort in the southern Indian Ocean. The RNZAF replacement crew will be ready to take up the search from tomorrow, weather permitting.”

Eleven of the returning P-3K2 crew will arrive back in Auckland just after midnight tonight.
