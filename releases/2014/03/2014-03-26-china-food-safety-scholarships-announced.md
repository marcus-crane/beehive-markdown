Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $900,000 has been allocated towards a new food safety scholarship programme with China.

“The Prime Minister confirmed this scholarship programme during his recent visit to China,” Ms Kaye says. “I am pleased to announce both the funding and some of the detail of the programme.

“The scholarship programme is being developed in partnership between New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). It is the first initiative of the Food Safety Cooperation Agreement signed in November last year (2013).

“It is my expectation that the Joint Food Safety Commission will meet in the next couple of months to agree implementation of this programme.” 

The programme will be delivered through Massey University and will give Chinese Food and Drug Administration officials a detailed insight into New Zealand’s food safety risk management systems.

“This is an important part of the deepening cooperation in food safety between our two countries,” Ms Kaye says. “By having official exchanges and scholarships we also increase the understanding of our respective food safety systems. I anticipate at least 10 people from China will participate in the programme over three years. This programme is directed at China to New Zealand exchanges but in the future, it is likely we will also look at New Zealand to China exchanges.

“The scholarship will cover best practice regulation, risk management, food process and design, and the development and implementation of food standards.

“Part of the scholarship will also likely include an internship for Chinese officials to get first-hand experience of New Zealand’s food safety with MPI or nominated food safety providers. 

“It is envisaged that scholarship participants will receive a university diploma upon completion.

“Massey University already has strong relationships with Chinese universities, research institutions and government and is well placed to deliver this programme successfully.”

The scholarship will be formally launched in the second half of this year and will run for three years.
