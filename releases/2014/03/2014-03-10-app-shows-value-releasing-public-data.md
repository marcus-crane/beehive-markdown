Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today hailed the Marine Mate smartphone application as a great example of central and local government collaborating to make public data more accessible.

Marine Mate provides a wide range of vital boating information, including tide times, boat ramp locations and boating bylaws, that matches its user’s location.

“Developed by Waikato Regional Council with data from Land Information New Zealand and other agencies, it has now achieved more than 14,000 downloads since its launch late last year.

“This smartphone app shows how public data can be used innovatively and made easily accessible.  The Government is working to make more non-personal data available for reuse and I look forward to seeing more products like this. 

“I would also urge business to take up the challenge to utilise the opportunities that exist for enterprising products and uses that can add to New Zealand’s economic growth,” Mr Williamson says.
