A leading health organisation devoted to improving the health of Pasifika peoples has been selected to establish a Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency, that will be known as Pasifika Futures announced Minister for Whanau Ora Tariana Turia and Minister for Pacific Island Affairs Peseta Sam Lotu-liga today.

“The Pasifika Medical Association has been at the forefront of improving the health and wellbeing of Pasifika peoples since 1996.  Today with a membership of more than 3000 health professionals, this NGO is a trusted expert and proven leader in the New Zealand health sector,” says Minister Turia.

“Pasifika Futures has the capacity to support and uplift Pacific families. They will help them realise their dreams, believe in themselves and transform them into self-determining families  who will make their own decisions for their futures,” says Minister Lotu-liga.

“I am excited about the opportunity Pasifika Futures presents for our families. Pasifika communities have embraced Whanau Ora since its inception. We have already witnessed amazing transformations within our communities. Great things can happen when families believe in themselves.They are able to realise their dreams and build a brighter future for their children,” says Mr Lotu-liga.

“Successful families are built on good leadership, love, compassion and commitment. It requires holistic support that is culturally appropriate and takes into account the needs of the whole family not just the individual. The new commissioning model reflects a strong commitment to community based leadership and decision making. They will work closely with  families to identify their priorities.  All Pacific nations have their own unique histories, traditions and legacies of leadership. These will become the most powerful resource in helping achieve our families’ aspirations. I look forward to hearing about the changes within families and their plans for a better future,” says Mr Lotu-liga.

“Whanau Ora is not about service provision where families risk getting shunted from agency to agency. Whanau Ora is about building the capability and capacity of families to deal with issues confronting them,” says Mrs Turia.

Last year Minister Turia announced that the Government would appoint three non - governmental commissioning agencies to oversee Whanau Ora contracts in the North Island, the South Island and Pasifika communities respectively. Te Puni Kokiri has led the procurement process with support from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Treasury and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs. The announcements for the NGO Commissioning Agencies for the North and South Islands will be made in due course.
