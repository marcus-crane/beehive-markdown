Prime Minister John Key welcomes the arrival of Croatia’s Prime Minister Zoran Milanović to New Zealand tomorrow for the first official visit from Croatia since 1995.

“Croatia is the newest member of the European Union, and I look forward to discussing their perspective on the European region with Prime Minister Milanović,” says Mr Key.

“The visit is also a chance to develop trade and business links by building on the long-standing relationship between our two countries which is based around the strong Croatian community here. 

“The extension last year of a visa waiver for Croatian visitors to New Zealand was a fitting recognition of our historic links and the growing relationship between New Zealand and Croatia,” says Mr Key.

While in New Zealand Prime Minister Milanović will witness the signing of a Working Holiday Scheme that will allow young people from New Zealand and Croatia to travel and work in each other’s countries for up to a year.

He will be accompanied by the Croatian Defence Minister Ante Kotromanović, who will meet separately with Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman, and will visit Devonport Naval Base.

Prime Minister Milanović will be in New Zealand from March 13 - 17. There will be an official welcoming and a wreath laying ceremony in Auckland on Friday.
