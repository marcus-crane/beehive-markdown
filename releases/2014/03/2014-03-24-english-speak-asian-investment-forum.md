Finance Minister Bill English leaves for Hong Kong tonight, where he will deliver a keynote speech to a major annual Asian investment conference and meet a number of business and investment leaders.

“Hong Kong and the rest of China are significant and fast-growing trade and investment partners for New Zealand,” Mr English says.

“It’s important that we build on our profile in these markets and remind businesses and investors of the opportunities available our growing economy.”

Mr English will give a keynote speech to the annual Credit Suisse Asian investment conference on Wednesday, where he will outline the opportunities for New Zealand to lock in long-term gains from a number of improving economic indicators.

He will also meet Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan, along with New Zealand and Hong Kong business and investment leaders.

Mr English returns to New Zealand on Thursday.
