New Zealand’s riskiest intersections are being targeted for safety improvements as part of the Government’s on-going effort to reduce death and injury on our roads, Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse announced today.

“The Government has tasked the NZ Transport Agency and local authorities to identify New Zealand’s 100 highest-risk intersections in order to target safety improvements,” Mr Woodhouse says. 

“We’re making good progress in reducing the road toll, but there is no room for complacency. It’s great to see these agencies working together to achieve tangible results that will reduce crashes, prevent injuries and save lives.”

Mr Woodhouse said the list had been compiled by the NZ Transport Agency, with input from local authorities, by using guidelines developed in 2013 to provide a nationally consistent method of assessing crash data to identify intersection crash risks. Crash figures were analysed for the ten years from 2003 to 2012, with 53 deaths and 445 serious injuries recorded at the 100 highest-risk intersections over that period.

Guidance has also been provided to road controlling authorities on the most effective ways of improving safety at intersections for all road users. 

“The government has been pushing ahead with safety improvements while the list was in draft form, and it’s pleasing to see 22 of these intersections have already had safety improvements completed, with planning or investigation at various stages for the remaining 78.

"The list will be a permanent initiative and be updated periodically, with improvements monitored to ensure they are delivering results.”

Mr Woodhouse says the high-risk intersection work is part of the Government’s broader Safer Journeys strategy which aims to significantly reduce deaths and serious injuries from road crashes by 2020.

“We’re working hard to make every part of our road transport system safer for all road users, by improving roads and roadsides, promoting safer vehicles, encouraging safer speeds and safer road use.

“The countermeasures to improve safety will be different for each of these intersections. In some locations the most effective steps to reduce crash risk may be better managing traffic flows or speeds, while for others the best solution will be improved signage or physical changes to the road layout, and for some the answer may be a mix of all of these things.”
