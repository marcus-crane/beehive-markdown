Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today marked the official opening of a Housing New Zealand redevelopment comprising of 22 new two-bedroom apartments in Three Kings, Auckland.

“This modern, fit-for-purpose complex is a far cry from the four old, standalone houses that previously sat on this underutilised site. These apartments will provide a warm, dry and safe home for elderly and disabled tenants in close proximity to key facilities and amenities such as the supermarket, the local library and public transport,” Dr Smith says.

“I was heartened to meet today with some of the tenants who will reap the many positive benefits of their new home.

“Housing New Zealand’s aim is to provide quality housing for those in the greatest need and which better suit tenants’ needs. The new apartments on this site will contribute to meeting the demand for smaller, more compact housing in Auckland’s city fringe suburbs.

“This redevelopment demonstrates further progress in Housing New Zealand’s record $2.9 billion three-year investment to deliver good quality state houses of the right size and in the right place for people with high housing needs.”
