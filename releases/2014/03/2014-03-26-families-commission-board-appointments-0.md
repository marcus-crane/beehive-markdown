Social Development Minister Paula Bennett announced today the appointment of two new members to the Board of the Families Commission.

Retired Family Court Judge Paul von Dadelszen and Jo-anne Wilkinson, MNZN, Project K co-founder, have been appointed for three year terms to fill two vacant positions on the board of the Families Commission. 

Mr von Dadelszen retired in May 2013 after 25 years as a District/Family Court Judge. He is Chair of the Ministerial Expert Advisory Group on Family Violence and is a member of the Family Violence Death Review Committee. Mr von Dadelszen continues to be involved in a number of international professional networks in the area of family law.

Ms Wilkinson is currently a consultant acting as a capability mentor to a number of non-government organisations in the social sector. Until 2012, she worked as Chief Executive of the Foundation for Youth Development (previously known as Project K Trust), an organisation she co-founded in 1995. Ms Wilkinson continues to be involved in the Foundation as a Board member and is a Grievance Panel member at the Youth Justice Residence, Korowai Manaaki.

“I’d also like to acknowledge the contribution of retiring Commissioner Sir Harawira “Wira” Tiri Gardiner.  Sir Wira’s wise counsel has been valuable as the Commission is reshaped for the future.

“Mr von Dadelszen and Ms Wilkinson bring a wealth of experience to the Commission. Both have practical first-hand experience of issues facing many New Zealand families and we are fortunate to have them on the Board.

“These appointments, combined with legislative changes announced last week, will ensure that the work of the Families Commission remains credible, and relevant to the needs of community organisations working with families,” said Mrs Bennett.
