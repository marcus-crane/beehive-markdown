Business owners and senior executives looking to expand their international expertise are being invited to apply for the 2014 Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says the scholarships are designed to grow skills and business capability to make New Zealand firms more internationally competitive.

“The knowledge gained from the world’s top business schools by our senior executives will benefit the companies they return to and in turn, help to grow the New Zealand economy and jobs,” Mr Joyce says.

“Our distance from overseas markets and the size of our economy can be a challenge to firms wanting to enter international markets.  The scholarships help to develop the global mindset of our business leaders.

“Many of our smaller companies can have difficulty when expanding into overseas markets because they lack the knowledge or contacts.  These scholarships provide an opportunity for recipients to learn best international practices and develop valuable networks they can bring back to their business. I encourage smaller firms to apply for the scholarships.”

The recipients of last year’s 10 scholarships studied at prestigious international institutions such as Stanford, INSEAD (The Business School For The World), Harvard, and the London Business School. The scholarships cover up to 50 per cent of course-related costs.

Applications for the scholarships close on 30 April. For more information go to: [http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/prime-ministers-business-scholarships](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/prime-ministers-business-scholarships)
