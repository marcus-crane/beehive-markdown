Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed the announcement of successful applicants to deliver Pacific programmes for TVNZ.

TVNZ today named its preferred independent companies to produce Māori and Pacific programmes. These include a new company employing current TVNZ staff as the preferred applicant for long-running *Tagata Pasifika* and Tiki Lounge for *Fresh.*

“I congratulate the successful bidders who have taken this opportunity to showcase Pacific talent,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“New Zealand's unique cultural identity and diversity will continue to be reflected on screen.

“The outsourcing of production to independent companies is an effective model to promote entrepreneurial flair.

“Staff from the Māori and Pacific Programming team have a proven track record in broadcasting. I am pleased that the new independent companies have expressed a willingness to take on existing TVNZ staff. This means talented people with many years of experience will be able to continue their valuable work.

“I commend TVNZ for its continued willingness to support Pacific content.”

Pacific and Māori programming is funded by NZ On Air and Te Mangai Paho.
