Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the 10 year anniversary of the passing of the Smoke-free Environments Act is a good opportunity to look forward to further gains in tobacco control.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will today host an event in Parliament to mark the 10th anniversary of the law which bans smoking in bars, clubs, casinos, restaurants, and school buildings and grounds. It also banned the display of tobacco products at point of sale and increased the power of judges to punish retailers caught repeatedly selling tobacco to minors.

“This anniversary is a good time to reflect on how far we have come,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga. “Research shows support for the legislation increased from 38% in 2001 to 95% in 2006.”

“Our goal now is to achieve a Smokefree New Zealand by 2025.  This goal is a challenge, but one that can be realistically achieved with continued and additional efforts on a range of tobacco control fronts.

“We must continue the comprehensive approach to tobacco control. No single component on its own will get us there.  

“Price is a strong incentive to get people to stop smoking and deter young people from starting.  We must also continue to change smoking behaviour through effective media campaigns and we must create new and innovative ways of discouraging young people from taking up this extremely addictive habit and supporting people to quit.  These interventions, and more, will help us achieve our ambitious goal.”

New Zealand was the second country in the world to go smokefree in hospitality settings. Now many countries have followed suit, including Australia, Canada, South Africa, France and many states in the USA.

Since the law was enacted there have been three prosecutions against publicans. This shows a general acceptance of the law.
