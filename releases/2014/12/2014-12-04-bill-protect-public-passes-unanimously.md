Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga welcomed the passing of a Bill which will help protect New Zealanders from sexual and violent offenders in the community who are at high risk of re-offending.

The Parole (Extended Supervision Orders) Amendment Bill had its third and final reading in Parliament today and passed with unanimous support from all political parties.

The Bill expands Extended Supervision Orders (ESOs) for child sex offenders beyond their current maximum 10 year limit for those who pose a high risk of serious reoffending.  ESOs will also be extended to include the management of high risk sex offenders against adults and very high risk violent offenders.

“The first offenders currently subject to a 10-year ESO are coming to the end of their orders from early 2015.  The passage of this legislation will ensure that these high risk offenders can be managed by Corrections beyond their ESO expiry dates,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“The Bill was strengthened this week to ensure that any contact between offenders on ESOs and children is strictly controlled.

“We need to do as much as possible to keep our families and especially our children safe. Corrections needs to be able to continue to manage a small number of high risk offenders in the community for as long as necessary.

“This Bill is part of this Government’s comprehensive program of law and order reform.  It strikes the right balance between protecting the public from serious sexual and violent harm and the rights of offenders once their prison sentence is complete.

“We are committed to keeping our communities safe as part of our Government’s plan to deliver Better Public Services.

“I also want to acknowledge the cross-party support for this Bill since its introduction in the House.”

This Bill was also further strengthened this week to:

- provide a single point of judicial decision-making in respect of the highest risk offenders who complete a finite prison sentence
- provide that a court may impose an interim ESO while it is considering an ESO application

This Bill complements the Public Safety (Public Protection Orders) Bill which was also passed today.

**Notes:**

ESOs are granted by the Court on application from the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections. The Parole Board then imposes special conditions relating to an offender’s management.

The orders were introduced in 2004 following significant public concern about the release from prison of some child sex offenders. Each application to the Court is accompanied by an assessment report (by a practising psychologist or psychiatrist) of an individual’s risk of re-offending.

The Bill will enable orders to be renewed for as long as they are needed, with regular mandatory review by the courts.
