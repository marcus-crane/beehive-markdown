Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew today welcomed five officials from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) who are in New Zealand for a ten week scholarship programme.

“This scholarship programme reinforces New Zealand and China’s commitment to food safety, and strengthens mutual understanding of each other’s food safety systems,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Over the next two weeks the group will see New Zealand’s food safety systems at work as they intern at organisations including the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI), AgResearch, AsureQuality and Plant and Food Research.

“When the group return to China they will take with them increased knowledge of New Zealand’s regulatory practice, health claims, risk management, and the development and implementation of food standards.

“We hope this programme will lead to an increased understanding between both regulators, and an alignment of approaches between China and New Zealand’s food safety systems.

“This programme enhances the close cooperation between our countries, resulting in a stronger bilateral relationship in the area of food safety and consumer confidence.”

The five selected CFDA officials met with Minister Goodhew at MPI today, as they begin the last leg of the programme. The programme is an initiative developed under the Ministry of Primary Industries and the Chinese Food and Drug Administration’s Food Safety Cooperation Arrangement signed in November 2013.
