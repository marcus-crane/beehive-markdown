Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the announcement of an immediate start to the Canterbury Engineering the Future (CETF) construction project as good news for the University of Canterbury, Christchurch and New Zealand.

The Government is supporting the project as part of its contribution of up to $260 million to fund the redevelopment of the engineering facilities and development of new science buildings at the University. The new state-of-the-art facilities will meet the learning needs of students into the future.

“The University of Canterbury has an international reputation for quality civil and structural engineering teaching and the new facilities, once completed, can only enhance this,” Mr Joyce says.

“The taxpayer’s investment in engineering and science will support the University to provide high quality education and research and make a significant contribution to the on-going Canterbury rebuild and recovery.

“The rebuild after the earthquakes is a unique opportunity for the University to develop a learning and research environment that’s truly fit for the 21st century. The benefits to the city and the country from this facility in terms of building a skilled workforce will last long into the future.”

When completed this facility will be a big boost to the Government’s priority of strengthening tertiary education provision for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.

“New Zealand needs to produce significantly more engineering graduates. This new facility at the University of Canterbury will help achieve that. For our industries to compete on the world stage a skilled engineering workforce is crucial,” Mr Joyce says.
