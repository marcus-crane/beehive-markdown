Leader of the House Gerry Brownlee says the Government is very pleased with its busy and productive legislative year, which ended with Parliament’s adjournment this afternoon.

“This is a Government that’s focused on working for New Zealand, delivering sustainable economic growth, and helping households get ahead. The Government’s legislative achievements this year clearly reflect this,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Due to the General election in September, the House sat for 70 days this year, compared to 93 days in 2013.

“Despite having fewer sitting days, we saw 73 bills pass their third reading and become law this year. This included the Vulnerable Children’s Bill, reflecting the Government’s commitment to sustainable policies that will make a real difference to Kiwi children and their families.

“A continuing priority for the Government is the settlement of Treaty grievances, a process being superbly led by the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson.

“Parliament’s Business Committee has enabled extended hours to progress Treaty Legislation on 13 occasions this year, and I want to commend the parties and members across this House for supporting this innovative approach.

“All 13 settlement bills passed their third reading into law, including the completion of historical settlements in the South Island.

“The rate at which Treaty claims are settled has increased significantly, and extended sitting hours have been used to progress non-controversial legislation since 2012. All willing and able iwi should have deeds of settlement by 2017.

“Parliament sat for 23 weeks in 2014; there were 65 question times with members answering 788 oral questions and thousands more supplementary questions.

“Out of the 1409 hours the House sat in 2014, only 126 hours were held under urgency.

“There have been 1266 papers presented this year, similar to 2013.

“Up until Tuesday 9 December, Ministers had been asked 9695 written questions.”
