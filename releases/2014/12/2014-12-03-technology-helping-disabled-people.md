Minister for Disability Issues Nicky Wagner says the International Day of Persons with Disabilities is an opportunity to celebrate New Zealand’s work with disabled people and look forward to what we can achieve in the future.

“The International Day is an opportunity to reflect on issues that affect surprisingly many New Zealanders. Almost one in four – or 1.1 million – New Zealanders live with some form of disability,” Ms Wagner said.

“The focus of the International Day this year is on ‘*Sustainable Development: The Promise of New Technology*’.

“Technology is playing an increasing part in all aspects of our lives, however some of its greatest impacts can be seen at work.

“While there are more disabled people in employment, there is still work to be done. The 2013 Disability Survey showed that 45 percent of disabled people were employed compared to 72 percent of non-disabled people.

“Innovative use of technology can help support disabled people into work, for example screen readers can assist visually impaired employees and voice recognition software can help employees who are less able or unable to type.

“Work is fundamental to a person’s sense of wellbeing and is something I am very passionate about. That’s why I am pleased that work is a focus of the Disability Action Plan 2014 – 2018.

“New Zealand is seen as a world leader in disability issues and the Disability Action Plan will continue this good work. We are also launching the Waikato demonstration of Enabling Good Lives, an approach that provides disabled people with more choice about their lives.

The International Day of Persons with Disabilities has been observed on 3 December since 1992.

“There are many events being held around New Zealand to celebrate the International Day, including the Attitude Awards in Auckland tonight. The Awards celebrate achievement in the disability sector across all disabilities and I congratulate each of this year’s winners and nominees.

“Finally, I wish to acknowledge the work of disabled people, their families, and the individuals and groups that support them. The International Day is a good opportunity to take stock of what has been accomplished, with a view on what more needs to be done,” Ms Wagner said.
