Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $100,000 in funding to expand the ‘Youth in Emergency Services’ programme to ten new communities around New Zealand.

This will mean up to 16 young people in each of the following communities can be part of the programme in 2015: Hurunui, Taupō, Kawakawa/Moerewa, Central Otago, Taranaki, Upper Hutt, Kapiti, Murupara, Maketu and Katikati.

“This is an exciting programme that opens the door for young people to volunteer or follow a career path in emergency services, such as fire, ambulance and search and rescue.

“From chatting to communities where the programme has already run, I know what a boost it can be for areas that struggle to find volunteers.

“At the same time, the programme engages young people, helps them learn valuable skills and enables them to serve their community in a meaningful way.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for young people to grow their confidence and capabilities, and I’m thrilled that 160 more budding emergency professionals can seize this opportunity next year.”

**Notes for editors:**

- the programme runs during evenings and weekends over four to six weeks, usually beginning in late summer
- everyone taking part has the opportunity to rotate around the different emergency services
- the final weekend involves a coordinated exercise involving all the emergency services, so participants can put all the skills and knowledge they’ve learned to the test in a real-life scenario
