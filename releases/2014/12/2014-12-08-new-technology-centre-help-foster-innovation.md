Police Minister Michael Woodhouse today opened the Mobility Innovation Lab and Experience Centre which will help Police, government and business develop mobile tools and technology that benefit New Zealand.

 

“This Mobility Innovation Lab and Experience Centre will bring together stakeholders from the public and private sectors to focus on ideas that will make a difference to all New Zealanders,” Mr Woodhouse says.

 

“It will help foster innovation and encourage rapid deployment of ideas and tools.

 

“With 14,000 mobility devices already rolled out across the country, Police will be focused on how mobile technology can help in preventing crime and supporting victims of crime.”

 

Other organisations and groups will be able to work in the centre and share in its products and developments.

 

“The Government has set a challenge for the public sector to improve the services and outcomes it provides for New Zealanders.

 

“The all-of-government solutions that could flow from this initiative and the areas that could benefit are extensive. From mobile apps that help front line officers to business technology that can be exported to the world, the potential is limitless.”
