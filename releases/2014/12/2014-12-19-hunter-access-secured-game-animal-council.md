Associate Conservation Minister Hon Peter Dunne today congratulates the Game Animal Council and Te Urewera Board for their hard work to ensure access to the land previously known as Te Urewera National Park.

The Te Urewera Board instigated a review of access to and management of the land earlier this year temporarily preventing access for hunters. The Game Animal Council was the voice for hunters in this review and this positive result shows how important the Council is” said Mr Dunne.

The Game Animal Council provided input to the new management system and met several times with the Board during the review. The Council is satisfied hunters will continue to be able to enjoy their time in the bush as they did before.

“The Game Animal Council’s hard work has ensured that hunters and their families will be able to be in the area hunting before Christmas and throughout the holiday period; I commend them for their efforts.
