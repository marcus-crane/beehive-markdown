Education Minister Hekia Parata has appointed an advisory group to help children get the best possible start to their early learning and schooling.

The Advisory Group on Early Learning will recommend practical ways to ensure children have consistent teaching and learning from birth to eight years old, including helping teachers to implement the early childhood education curriculum.

“We need early childhood teachers and educators, parents and new entrant teachers working together at a time that’s critical for children developing their foundations for learning and language.

“The group will suggest ways to strengthen implementation of the early childhood education curriculum framework, *Te Whāriki,* and how we can have better planning, implementation and evaluation across the early learning and schooling sectors for the benefit of young children,” says Ms Parata.

Dr Joce Nuttall has been appointed chair, with Dame Dr Iritana Tawhiwhirangi, Adelle Broadmore, Jeanette Clarkin-Phillips, Ali Glasgow, Carol Hartley, Dr Lesley Rameka, Brenda Soutar, Jan Taouma and Jan Tinetti as members.

Ms Parata says the members of the advisory group bring strengths, skills and experience that span the early learning and primary schooling sectors as well as specialist knowledge of Māori, Pasifika and special education priorities.

“They’ve been selected for their knowledge of evidence and practical experience of ‘on the ground’ teaching. I’m delighted with the very high calibre of the people who were willing to contribute to this important work.

“In the coming months the advisory group will seek input from stakeholders and report to me no later than 30 June 2015,” says Ms Parata.
