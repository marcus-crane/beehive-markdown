Social Development Minister Anne Tolley today congratulated the 19 young recipients of the 2014 William Wallace awards.

An annual award for children in care, each scholarship recipient will receive between $1,500 and $3,000 towards tertiary, vocational, or leadership training.

“These young people had a harder start to life than most. The William Wallace awards recognise how far they and their foster families have come and the strength of character they've shown taking charge of their futures.

“The people who nominated the award-winners, without exception, spoke of their outstanding determination, optimism, and commitment to their goals.

“Not only are they inspirations to their schools and communities, but to other young people in care facing similar hardships,” Mrs Tolley says.

Named after William Wallace, a former foster child, who left a generous bequest to Child, Youth and Family, the awards are intended to nurture children and young people in care, and help them develop their potential.

“One thing that strikes me is how much these young people are already giving back to their communities – many have taken on the responsibilities of leaders, peer mentors, volunteers and parents.

“Our award winners and their foster families can be incredibly proud of what they’ve achieved, and these awards will help them do even more in their lives.” says Mrs Tolley.
