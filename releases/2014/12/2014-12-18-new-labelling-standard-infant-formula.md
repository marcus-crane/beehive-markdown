Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew has today welcomed a new standard under the Animal Products Act that clarifies the labelling requirements for infant formula exports.

“Currently all export dairy products are exempt from New Zealand’s food labelling standards, they instead meet labelling requirements of the importing country,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Infant formula is a special product. For this reason, the Ministry has put in place this new standard, which applies regardless of where the infant formula is being sent. This will ensure exporters know what information must be on labels, and what information and images are prohibited.

“For instance, in most countries exporters can’t make health claims on infant formula for the youngest babies, and the standard clarifies that labels can’t use pictures or statements that could imply infant formula is better than breastmilk.”

The standard also sets criteria for the use of “Made in New Zealand” claims.

“These changes will ensure consumers have confidence that infant formula products labelled as ‘made in New Zealand’ have been manufactured within our well regarded food safety system,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The changes will ensure the integrity of our products, and provide our exporters greater clarity and support. We want to protect New Zealand’s reputation as a supplier of high quality, safe and suitable food.”

The infant formula export labelling standard and associated guidance document is available on the MPI website at [www.foodsafety.govt.nz](http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/industry/sectors/dairy/documents/legislation.htm)
