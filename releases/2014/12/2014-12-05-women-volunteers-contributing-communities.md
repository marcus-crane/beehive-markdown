Minister for Women Louise Upston today recognises women around the country for the hours they contribute to their communities.

“With today being International Volunteers Day I want to acknowledge the thousands of New Zealand women who on average spend over four hours a day completing unpaid work.

“These women give up their time to volunteer in their communities in places such as sports clubs, on their marae, in education, social services and in faith communities.

“Voluntary work provides many benefits for communities. For many women it can also provide an opportunity to learn new skills and to develop contacts.

“There are also a number of organisations within the not-for-profit sector offering a wide range of programmes and services to women who need assistance. Many of these organisations rely on volunteer support, and a large number of these volunteers are dedicated and talented women,” Ms Upston says.

New Zealanders give 1.8 million hours of their time volunteering each week. The 2013 Census recorded an increase in the number of women volunteering in the seven years since data was last collected, with 268,000 women and 200,784 men helping their communities.

“I’d like to say thanks to these volunteers who are helping to make a difference in communities around New Zealand,” Ms Upston says.
