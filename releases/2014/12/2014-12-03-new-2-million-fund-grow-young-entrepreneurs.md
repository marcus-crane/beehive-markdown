Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today launched the ‘Youth Enterprise Fund’, aimed at helping today’s young people become tomorrow’s entrepreneurs.

“The fund is part of the Government’s 2014 Budget announcement of $2.5 million of new funding for youth enterprise initiatives.

“This is about growing the next generation of confident citizens, who can contribute to their communities and make their mark in ways that deliver cultural, economic and environmental benefits.”

The fund will make $2 million available over the next three years, for projects that provide ‘hands on’ learning opportunities to help youth develop entrepreneurial skills and knowledge.

“The skills and attributes the fund aims to foster include leadership, communication, innovation, problem solving, environmental and social responsibility, personal management and resilience.

“Funding is available for new or existing projects, including internships, business start-ups and mentoring opportunities. Projects can be in a school, tertiary, business or community setting.”

Priority will be given to organisations with a track record developing youth enterprise initiatives, and projects which address the needs of disadvantaged youth.

“I’ve met with many young people, who have asked for more support to help them realise their aspirations in a fast changing world. That’s exactly what this fund will provide.”

Applications close on 16 January 2015.
