Helping your friends and family stay safe on the water this holiday season is the gift that lasts a lifetime, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Taking the boat out for a spot of fishing or a bit of fun is a classic Kiwi summer pastime,” Mr Foss says. 

“But we need to ensure our loved ones come home safe and sound from the beach, lake or river.

“Please, tell the boaties in your life you want them around for many more holidays to come, so they need to:

- Check they have the correct number of properly fitting lifejackets
- Check the weather forecast
- Tell someone where they’re going and when they’ll be back
- Avoid alcohol before and while on the water
- Register and carry an emergency locator beacon

“Research by Maritime New Zealand shows one in three New Zealanders are involved in recreational boating.  With so many people on the water, it’s all the more important to take boat safety seriously.

“National maritime rules require skippers to carry lifejackets and ensure everyone on board wears them when conditions become risky. 

“Passengers can help ensure their own safety by putting a lifejacket on as soon as they board a boat — especially smaller ones where the risk of an accident is much higher.

“By reminding the keen boatie in your family to follow these simple steps, we can all look forward to a safe and happy time on the water this summer,” Mr Foss says.
