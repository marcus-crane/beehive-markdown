Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says support for New Zealand veterans is about to change for the better.

“Now, perhaps more than ever, the contribution our service people have made and continue to make to protect our way of life is being considered, recognised and honoured,” Mr Foss says.

The Veterans’ Support Act, which comes into force on December 7, gives Veterans’ Affairs the ability to introduce new types of entitlements and support for veterans and their families.

“In time, Veterans’ Affairs can take a broader approach to the assistance it provides.  It can focus not just on service-related health care needs, but take into account veterans social and work needs as well.

“This means looking at social and vocational rehabilitation for current and former servicemen and women, looking at better ways to support them to live independently and helping them remain in or return to employment, if possible.

“First and foremost, service eligibility criteria remain unchanged and no veteran will have their current entitlements reduced,” Mr Foss says.
