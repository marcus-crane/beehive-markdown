Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today congratulated the Customs Service for their role in the interception of a shipment of liquid methamphetamine.

Approximately 3.5 kilograms of liquid methamphetamine with a street value of around $1 million was intercepted and two people arrested following a joint Police and Customs operation, codenamed Operation Gravity.

“I would like to congratulate Customs for their excellent work and collaboration with Police. This is another great example of our enforcement agencies working together to keep harmful drugs off our streets,” Ms Wagner said.

“These substances can have devastating effects not only on individuals, but on their families and communities.

“The outcome of this operation is a tribute to the hard work and vigilance of all the officers involved and it sends a strong message to those who attempt to bring drugs into New Zealand that they face being caught and prosecuted,” Ms Wagner said.

The two people arrested appeared in the Wellington District Court today charged with importing a Class A controlled drug and conspiracy to supply a Class A controlled drug.
