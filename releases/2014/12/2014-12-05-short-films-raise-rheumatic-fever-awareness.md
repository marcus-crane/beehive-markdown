Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga say a collection of short films will help raise awareness about rheumatic fever.

“Rheumatic fever is a serious disease which starts with a sore throat and can lead to lifelong heart, joint, skin and nerve problems,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government has set a target of reducing the rates of rheumatic fever by two-thirds by 2017. To achieve this we have invested more than $65 million over six years to fight the disease.

“This collection of short films made by students is a good example of the excellent work going on across the country.”

Auckland’s James Cook High School, Mt Roskill Grammar, Kelston Boys High School, Tamaki College and two community youth groups have each made a short film, all are available via YouTube.

The project is a partnership between the Ministry of Health’s Rheumatic Fever Prevention Programme and the [Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs](http://www.mpia.govt.nz/).

“As well as boosting young people’s knowledge on the risks and symptoms of rheumatic fever, the project also showcases the creative talent of budding young filmmakers with students able to gain NCEA credits for completing their films,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“This project is a good example of the Ministries of Health and Pacific Island Affairs working together to improve outcomes for at-risk Pacific and Māori young people.”
