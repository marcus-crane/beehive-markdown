Climate Change Minister Tim Groser will tomorrow travel to Lima, Peru to take part in a key meeting on climate change which will pave the way for a binding climate change agreement in Paris at the end of next year.

“The meeting at Lima is critical to success at Paris next December where world leaders will agree a new binding Climate Change agreement that includes contributions from all major emitting countries for the first time,” says Mr Groser.

“I am particularly pleased to see the commitments expressed by the USA and China – the world’s two largest emitters.  Climate change is a global issue and it is good to see leadership from these major economies.

“At Lima we will clarify how countries will put forward their pledges next year and what the United Nations Green Climate Fund can deliver to support countries facing the impacts of climate change,” says Mr Groser.

In line with other countries, next year New Zealand will be announcing its pledge towards the world building a low carbon, resilient future. 

The Lima meeting is the annual Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
