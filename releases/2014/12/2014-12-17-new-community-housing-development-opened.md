Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett today opened Accessible Properties’ new community housing development in Johnsonville, furthering the Government’s commitment to providing better social housing for those in need.

Accessible Properties are a Community Housing Provider who manage close to 1000 housing units across New Zealand. Today’s event celebrated the completion of eight new units designed for tenants with social support need, and built with assistance from the Government’s Social Housing Fund.

“These new units are a great example of what can be achieved when Government, community organisations and businesses work together to provide quality, affordable housing for our most vulnerable,” says Mrs Bennett.

“I’m thrilled with the work Accessible Properties has done to build warm, modern social housing. The eight units, built alongside a further ten intended for general housing, will allow tenants to live and participate in a supportive neighbourhood suited to their needs.”

The Johnsonville units are 18 of 26 being built in the Wellington region with assistance from the Government’s Social Housing Fund.

“The Government has increased its support of Community Housing Providers through both the Social Housing Fund and by making registered organisations eligible for the Income-Related Rent Subsidy,” says Mrs Bennett. 

“The Government is committed to providing more housing support to New Zealanders who need it, and developments like these mean we can house more people in better housing for the duration of their need.”
