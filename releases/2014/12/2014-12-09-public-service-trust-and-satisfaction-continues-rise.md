State Services Minister Paula Bennett has welcomed the latest *Kiwis Count* survey results, showing the levels of trust and satisfaction New Zealanders have in the frontline public services they use continues to increase.

The State Services Commission’s annual *Kiwis Count* survey looks at trust based on experience and perception, and satisfaction in public services, and shows improvements in both measures this year compared to last year.     

“This Government’s unwavering commitment to delivering better public services, as New Zealanders expect and deserve, is reflected in the steady improvement in feedback over the past seven years,” says Mrs Bennett.   

New Zealanders’ trust in public services based on a recent experience has increased to 77 per cent, up ten points from 2007.

Satisfaction levels have also increased, up one point from 2013 to 73 per cent out of 100 this year.

“We are incredibly lucky in New Zealand to have a high calibre, responsive and transparent public sector that genuinely works to put New Zealanders first,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Agencies are increasingly changing the way they work so that the needs of people using their services come first and foremost. This means integrating and streamlining services to make things easier, and recognising what it is people need, and tailoring services towards that,” says Mrs Bennett. 

“The rising levels of satisfaction people are reporting with our public services is a reflection of this improved approach, and it’s pleasing today’s results highlight the increase in positive experiences that people are having.” 

The latest *Kiwis Count* survey was carried out between July 2013 and June 2014, and surveyed 6099 people. The report is available here: [www.ssc.govt.nz/kiwis-count](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/kiwis-count).
