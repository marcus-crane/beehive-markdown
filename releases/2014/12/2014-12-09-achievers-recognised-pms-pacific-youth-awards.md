“I congratulate all the winners of the Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards,” says Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga. “These hugely talented young people have the potential to contribute significantly to the future of our nation.”

“Tonight five young Pacific leaders were recognised for their contribution to their communities through their achievements in the arts, commerce, sport, leadership and education.”

“Ensuring that our young people thrive is crucial for the economic and cultural outlook of New Zealand.
