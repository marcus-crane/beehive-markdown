Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has congratulated Dunedin on becoming the first New Zealand city to be internationally recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature.

“I’m delighted that Dunedin has achieved this significant milestone. As a cultural hub of the South, this is a testament to the city’s literary heritage and creativity,” says Ms Barry.

City of Literature is part of UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network, which aims for cities to work together towards cultural diversity and sustainable urban development.

“Dunedin represents a varied yet closely-knit creative community across literature, poetry, theatre, and songwriting, among others. This is an acknowledgement of Dunedin’s cultural heritage but also reflects its contemporary cultural sector,” says Ms Barry.

Dunedin joins three newly designated Cities of Literature: Granada in Spain, Heidelberg in Germany, and Prague in the Czech Republic.

“I commend the work of Dunedin City Council and those who contributed to the successful UNESCO bid,” says Ms Barry.
