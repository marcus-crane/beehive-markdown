Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the winners of New Zealand’s most prestigious annual science awards.

“The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes recognise researchers of the highest quality who are working on projects that are of real benefit to New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“Encouraging more young people and the general public to take an active interest in science is high on this Government’s agenda. The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes recognise the achievements of our scientists and those of our science educators and communicators, who all play such a vital role in inspiring excellence in research.”

The prizes were presented by Prime Minister John Key at a ceremony at Te Papa today:

- The Prime Minister’s Science Prize ($500,000) - He Kainga Oranga/Housing and Health Research Programme, led by Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman (University of Otago, based in Wellington);
- The Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize ($200,000) - A flash of light in the brain: Revealing brain function with laser light, Dr Karl Iremonger (University of Otago);
- The Prime Minister’s Science Teacher Prize ($150,000) - Therese Burrell (Onslow College);
- The Prime Minister’s Science Media Communication Prize ($100,000) - Dr Michelle Dickinson (University of Auckland); and
- The Prime Minister’s Future Scientist Prize ($50,000) - Timothy Logan (Darfield High School, Canterbury).

Five prizes are presented each year, with the aim of highlighting the way science underpins innovation, and helps to build a more competitive and productive economy.

“In addition, the prizes raise the profile and prestige of science, which has an important role to play in New Zealand’s economic growth and international competitiveness,” Mr Joyce says.

The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes are administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
