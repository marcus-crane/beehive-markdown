Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the passing of the Crimes (Match-fixing) Amendment Bill in Parliament today.

“Match-fixing is a growing problem internationally and it is the number one threat to the integrity, value and growth of sport,” says Dr Coleman.

“In New Zealand we are not immune to this growing threat. The passing of this Bill is an important step in protecting the integrity of our sport. 

“The legislation is timely with New Zealand hosting two major sporting events next year – the ICC Cricket World Cup and FIFA Under 20 World Cup.”

The Crimes (Match-fixing) Amendment Bill makes match-fixing a form of deception under section 240 of the Crimes Act.

Under the Bill, anyone who obtains a benefit or causes a loss by engaging in match-fixing could face a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The Bill comes into force on 15 December 2014.

“The legislation is part of a package of wider measures. The Government has worked with the sport sector and betting industry to ensure sufficient processes are in place to protect sport from match-fixing,” says Dr Coleman.

The New Zealand Policy on Sports Match-Fixing and Related Corruption was launched in May 2014. It includes a set of rules that governing sports bodies need to put in place to prevent and respond to match-fixing, such as bans from participation in sport for breaching the rules.
