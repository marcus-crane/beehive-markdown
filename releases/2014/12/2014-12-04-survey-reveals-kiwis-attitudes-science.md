A new survey has revealed the relevance of science and technology to Kiwis’ lives, with 90 per cent of respondents agreeing on the importance of studying those subjects at school.

Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata today released the *Public Attitudes to Science and Technology* survey, which was conducted as part of the Science in Society project – an education-science sector collaboration to lift engagement and achievement in science and technology.

”The Science in Society project is a unique opportunity for the education and science sectors to work together to encourage better engagement with science and technology across New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“This survey provides evidence that supports many of the project’s objectives and actions, and will be used as part of the overall evaluation of its effectiveness.”

The survey’s other main findings are that:

- 83 per cent of respondents consider science important for New Zealand’s international competitiveness, improving health (91 per cent) and preserving the environment (87 per cent);
- 80 per cent think it is important to be kept up to date on science issues; and
- 82 per cent think science is important for addressing key challenges affecting our society.

The survey also showed that there are opportunities to improve the relevance and communication of science, Ms Parata says. The package of actions in the blueprint for the Science in Society project, *A Nation of Curious Minds: He Whenua Hihiri I te Mahara*, is aimed at making real progress towards addressing those issues.

“The importance of science and innovation for our country can’t be underestimated. Getting more kids engaged and achieving in science education is vital to prepare them for the 21st century, and I know our teachers are committed to doing that,” Ms Parata says.

The Science in Society project has been developed in response to the National Science Challenges Panel’s leadership challenge to improve the understanding, skills, and adoption of science and technology in New Zealand.

The blueprint was released by Mr Joyce and Ms Parata in July  and developed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry of Education, with close involvement from the office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor.

“Science and the knowledge and innovation that flow from it play a critical role in creating and defining our future,” Mr Joyce says. “They are fundamental to our growing economy and improving living standards for all New Zealanders.”

The *Public Attitudes to Science and Technology*  survey involved more than 2500 online and 500 telephone interviews during September 2014: [http://www.msi.govt.nz/update-me/major-projects/science-and-society-project/public-attitudes-research](http://www.msi.govt.nz/update-me/major-projects/science-and-society-project/public-attitudes-research).
