Five Royal New Zealand Navy Seasprite helicopters have been sold to Peru, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

“Our recent purchase of eight new, more sophisticated Seasprite helicopters meant the older model Seasprites were available for sale and a deal has been struck with the Peruvian Government for them to buy them for their Navy,” Mr Brownlee says.

As well as the helicopters, Peru is buying spares and the Maverick missiles which are used with the helicopters.   

New Zealand has worked closely with a number of parties to make the sale happen, including a Canadian Government entity, the Canadian Commercial Corporation, which is acting as agent for the Peruvian Government, and the United States Government, which has had to approve the export from New Zealand of the American manufactured helicopters and missiles.

Mr Brownlee says a good price of $30 million has been achieved for the helicopters.  After the deduction of some costs, the remainder will return to the Defence Capital Plan. 

The first of the five Seasprites is scheduled to be shipped from New Zealand after three of the new replacement helicopters arrive in January.  Subsequent shipments have been timed to ensure the Navy is able to introduce the new helicopters into service before all the current Seasprite helicopters leave New Zealand.    

The five Seasprites have been used on the two frigates, TE KAHA and TE MANA, and the multi-role ship, CANTERBURY.
