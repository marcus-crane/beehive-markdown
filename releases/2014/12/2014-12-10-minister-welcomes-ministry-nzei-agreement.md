Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed an agreement between the Ministry of Education and NZEI to jointly work on ways to help raise educational outcomes.

Ms Parata says there will be focus on communities of learning, greater collaboration, improved transition through the education system for children, and better career pathways for early childhood and primary teachers.

“I have consistently said the door remained open to NZEI after it withdrew from the work around our $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative.

“I’m very pleased that the union has been able to reach agreement with the Ministry on a new way forward that will have the interests of students very much at the heart of it.

“What we’re doing with IES is making sure all kids have their very best shot at success by improving the quality of teaching and leadership across all classrooms and having schools work together on shared goals.

“I’m delighted we’ve had such strong endorsement from secondary teachers and principals, and this week I have approved the first 11 communities of schools to begin operating from the start of term one next year.”

Ms Parata says the Government looks forward to the report back from the joint Ministry-NZEI working parties next year.
