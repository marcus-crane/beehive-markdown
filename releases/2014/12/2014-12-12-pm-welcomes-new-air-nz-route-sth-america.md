Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has welcomed Air New Zealand’s announcement today that they are opening up a new route to South America.

Air New Zealand will start flying to Buenos Aires, Argentina three days a week from December 2015. The service is Air New Zealand’s first to South America.

“South America offers significant potential for the New Zealand tourism industry so I am pleased Air New Zealand has decided to start flying there,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand has welcomed 30,000 visitors from South and Central America in the past year -  a 7 per cent increase on the previous year. Brazil is one of the strongest markets, up 21 per cent in the past year.”

Mr Key says Tourism New Zealand has significantly increased its investment in South America, opening an office in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2013.

“Tourism New Zealand and Air New Zealand work in partnership to market New Zealand as a destination internationally and both are committed to growing the South America market,” says Mr Key.
