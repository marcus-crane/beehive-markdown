Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says today’s visit to South Canterbury DHB marks the end of a 20 DHB tour to engage with the health sector.

“Just two days after I was appointed Health Minister in October I began a 20 DHB tour as getting out and talking with the health workforce was a priority,” says Dr Coleman.

Dr Coleman has met with DHB Chairs and CEOs, as well as a range of clinical leaders, doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and staff.

“During my visits I have been consistent in my messages to the Chairs and CEOs,” says Dr Coleman.

“My priorities are ensuring high levels of clinician engagement in the leadership of the health system, increased focus on moving services into the community, and responsible financial management.

“As I have travelled around the country, it has really struck me that although the hospital buildings are on the same sites as when I was a practising doctor, the actual health system is very different.

“We need to continue to change the way healthcare is delivered, with more people getting the care they need away from hospitals.

“The feedback I am getting is that although there are still challenges, we are heading in the right direction.”
