The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently updating Civil Aviation Rules to better manage the safety risks of the use of remotely piloted aircraft (or drones), says Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss.

“New Zealanders are increasingly using remotely piloted aircraft, so it is important we have good regulation to manage the safety risks those aircraft can bring. The Government is committed to having regulation flexible enough to accommodate the growing use of the technology,” says Mr Foss.

“The use of remotely piloted aircraft is opening up significant business opportunities. The Government encourages this, but I want to ensure users are aware they are subject to Civil Aviation Rules.

Most remotely piloted aircraft can fly faster, further, and higher than traditional model aircraft, and can bring safety risks for other aircraft, people and property. These aircraft are being used for a wide range of applications, including recreational hobby activity, scientific research, agriculture, film and video production and real estate photography. Remotely piloted aircraft are currently regulated by a Civil Aviation Rule designed for model aircraft.

The CAA opened consultation on 4 December 2014 on a proposed new Civil Aviation Rule for remotely piloted aircraft operations. Anyone can give feedback on the proposed rule until 30 January 2015, through the CAA web site [www.caa.govt.nz/rpas](http://www.caa.govt.nz/rpas).

“The Government wants to ensure the rule changes do not impose undue regulatory burdens on users. But users need to know the rules, so their aircraft is not destroyed, and everyone in the air and on the ground gets home safely.

Remotely piloted aircraft users need to know their activity is currently subject to Civil Aviation Rules, and stick to those rules to ensure their activity is safe. Users can check their safety obligations at [www.airshare.co.nz](http://www.airshare.co.nz).

**Editor's notes:**

**Current Civil Aviation Rules for remotely piloted aircraft are:**

- The operator needs to be able to see the aircraft with their own eyes (that is, not through binoculars, a monitor, or smartphone).
- The aircraft must be flown only in daylight.
- The aircraft must give way to all crewed aircraft.
- The operator must not fly the aircraft higher than 120 metres (400 feet) above ground level.
- The operator must not fly aircraft closer than four kilometres from aerodromes.
- Operation in breach of Civil Aviation Rules could lead to a fine, a written warning, or prosecution by the Civil Aviation Authority.
