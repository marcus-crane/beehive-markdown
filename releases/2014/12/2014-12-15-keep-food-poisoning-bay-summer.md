As summer weather approaches and we look to pull the barbeque out of the shed, Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew reminds New Zealanders to remember basic food safety rules.

“New Zealand produces some of the safest food in the world, but it is still common for foodborne illnesses to peak over the summer months,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“It is easy to forget simple food safety practices when you are outdoors enjoying picnics, barbeques, and camping trips.

“We have already seen cases trending up, with over 700 people diagnosed with food poisoning due to campylobacter in November.

“By following simple food safety practices, food poisoning is easily preventable.”

Don’t let your holiday plans be disrupted with food poisoning, remember these simple rules:

- When out barbequing, remember to separate raw meat from cooked meat and cook your meat thoroughly until the juices run clear.
- Wash your hands before and after handling foods and thoroughly cleaning chopping boards and utensils.
- Make sure food isn’t left in the heat for long periods of time – if you’re eating outside in the sun, keep chilled food in a chilly bin.

“Preparing for a food-safe summer is a good investment to ensure a healthy and happy festive season,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Anyone with food safety questions is encouraged to phone the Ministry for Primary Industries’ free Food Safety Consumer Helpline, 0800 693 721.
