Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is pleased to announce the permanent appointment of lawyer Michael Doogan to the Māori Land Court.

Mr Doogan was temporarily appointed to the court last year to help meet the workload of the Māori Land Court and the Waitangi Tribunal.

“He has been a temporary judge of the Māori Land Court since January 2013 and in that time has proven to be a valued member of the Māori Land Court bench and has gained the trust and respect of Māori Land Court, court staff and his peers,” said Mr Flavell.

Judge Doogan has worked in both private practise and central government before taking up appointments overseas. In 1998 he joined the Crown Law Office in the Treaty Issues and International Law team. He has extensive experience at both the Waitangi Tribunal and Māori Land Court.
