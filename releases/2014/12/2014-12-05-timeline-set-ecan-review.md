The Government will finalise an options document on the future of Environment Canterbury (ECAN) for public discussion in the new year, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Associate Minister of Local Government Louise Upston said following their attendance at today’s Canterbury Mayoral Forum.

“Our timetable is to publish an options paper on the way forward for ECAN in March for public consultation, after further discussion with Canterbury mayors in February. We then intend to meet with all 10 councils across Canterbury and to receive public submissions before making final decisions on the future structure,” Dr Smith and Ms Upston said.

“Legislation is likely to be required which will go before a select committee and provide a further opportunity for public input. The new structure for ECAN is intended to be in place by late 2016.

“We have made plain that amalgamation is not on the agenda for Canterbury. Our principal focus is on ensuring we have the optimal structure for managing Canterbury’s very significant water resources. The 10 mayors have also written to the Government requesting that consideration be given to whether the current transport governance arrangements are optimal.

“The Government worked closely with Canterbury’s elected mayors in making the difficult decision in 2009 to install interim commissioners. The commissioners have done an excellent job in lifting Canterbury from being a laggard on water management to being a leader. We will be working closely with the Canterbury Mayoral Forum on the next steps to ensure we maintain the momentum in improving water management.

“The immediate priority in Canterbury is the earthquake recovery. In the longer term, the wise management of water for economic development, recreation and the environment will be critical to the region’s future. We want to take time to consult and get these decisions right,” Dr Smith and Ms Upston concluded.
