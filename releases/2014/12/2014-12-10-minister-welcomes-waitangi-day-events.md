Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has today welcomed the confirmation of a series of nationwide events to mark the 175th anniversary of the Treaty of Waitangi in 2015.

On Waitangi Day, 67 community events across New Zealand commemorating the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi will be supported by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. These range from an event at Manukau in Auckland which last year attracted over 30,000 people, to a small gathering on the Chatham Islands.

“Waitangi Day 2015 will be even more significant because of this anniversary. I encourage all New Zealanders to take the opportunity to reflect on what the Treaty means for our nation in the 21st century,” says Ms Barry.

The events on 6 February were chosen by the Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund Panel. In addition, the panel confirmed funds for events on other dates commemorating significant Treaty signings throughout the country.

The government’s wider approach to marking the anniversary of the Treaty will be coordinated by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, and a new logo has been developed as the official symbol.

“The Waitangi 175 logo depicts the kotuku in flight, representing our progress and looking ahead to the bicentenary of the signing in 2040,” says Ms Barry.
