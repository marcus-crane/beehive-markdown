Education Minister Hekia Parata has approved the first communities of schools, saying they are a big win for thousands of New Zealand kids.

Ms Parata says the first 11 communities will begin from term one of next year as part of the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative to lift educational achievement.

“We’ve had 71 expressions of interest so far, and today I’ve approved the first communities of schools which together have nearly 38 thousand students.”

Ms Parata says the 11 communities are across different areas of the country, cover all deciles and include primary, secondary, intermediate and area schools.

“This is a big win for our kids because schools will be working together in a way that hasn’t been seen before to lift the achievement of their students.

“They will have agreed and shared achievement goals and will be sharing expertise and best practice in leadership and teaching. The communities also form clear pathways for kids as they transition through their education, from day one through to senior schooling.

“I’m delighted by the enthusiasm and interest that’s been shown as boards of trustees, principals, teachers and parents see the real potential this has for kids, and I expect to approve more communities early next year.

“The Ministry will now be contacting the approved communities of schools to let them know and will make details of those available later this week.  It will also continue to work on the many others who have put their hands up.

“I again want to thank and acknowledge all of those in the sector who have worked together with us this year on the design and implementation of our plan so that we can see all of our kids doing their very best,” says Ms Parata.
