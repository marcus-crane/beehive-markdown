Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the announcement that Wynyard Group will locate its new global research and development facility within the Christchurch Innovation Precinct.

Wynyard specialises in advanced crime analytics and risk management software, and will house about 100 of its staff on the former McKenzie and Willis site, with plans to preserve the building’s historic High Street façade.

The site will also double as Wynyard’s global training facility for staff from its offices in the United States, Britain, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia.

“The Precinct is fast becoming a top address for innovative firms located in the city,” Mr Joyce says. “As a market leader in advanced crime analytics software and services, Wynyard is a very good fit.”

Wynyard will join key anchor tenants Vodafone and Kathmandu, alongside the new ICT Graduate School, Innovation Hub, and supporting agencies Callaghan Innovation and NZTE.

"This exciting array of companies will strengthen the innovation ecosystem in the new-look Christchurch CBD, and foster a culture of collaboration and adaptation by bringing together talented people and businesses in one location,” Mr Joyce says.

The Christchurch Innovation Precinct covers an area of approximately 3.6 hectares in the south-east corner of the Urban Frame and is located within three city blocks bounded by Lichfield, Manchester, St Asaph, High, Tuam and Madras Streets.
