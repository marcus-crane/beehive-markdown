Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee is today making his first visit to the home of the Royal New Zealand Navy and welcoming the Navy’s newest recruits into New Zealand’s armed forces.

Mr Brownlee will be Reviewing Officer for a combined graduation parade of 89 junior officers and trainee sailors at the Devonport Naval Base.  The largest graduation of the year will include weapons handling and ceremonial drill displays, attended by family, friends and the wider Navy community. 

“The Navy has built for itself a commendable reputation based upon professionalism and dedication,” Mr Brownlee says.

“From conflicts of the past to the present, and assistance to New Zealanders and others in their times of trouble, the reputation of the Navy has endured and been strengthened. 

“To contribute to the maintenance of the Navy’s professionalism and reputation is a responsibility that these newest sailors have accepted and I commend them for that.”

While at Devonport Mr Brownlee will receive briefings on Navy capabilities and will visit Naval teams that operate in the coastal zone, including operational divers, mine counter measures personnel, and the maritime survey team, before visiting HMNZS Manawanui, the Navy’s specialist dive tender.
