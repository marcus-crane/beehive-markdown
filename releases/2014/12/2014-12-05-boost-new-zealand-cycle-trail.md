Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key today announced the Government is investing nearly $1 million in thirteen projects to help maintain the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

Mr Key says $970,000 will go towards maintaining and enhancing cycle trails from Northland to Southland to ensure they continue to generate economic benefit to regional communities.

“The New Zealand Cycle Trail attracts high-value visitors and helps New Zealand stay on the international map as a top tourist destination.

“A recent report showed the trails are going from strength to strength. Last summer the New Zealand Cycle Trail experienced a 56 per cent average growth rate, with an estimated 97,000 trail users for the month of January 2014 alone.”

The Government is investing $8 million over four years to maintain the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail network.

“This contestable funding will assist with maintaining the quality of the trails should they experience significant weather damage or need major changes,” says Mr Key.

The thirteen projects to receive funding in this first funding round are:

- Motu Trails Charitable Trust  (Bay of Plenty) $15,000
- Queenstown Trails Trust (Otago) $38,400
- Queenstown Trails Trust (Otago) $175,200
