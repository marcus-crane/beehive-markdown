Help your friends and family stay safe on the roads this festive season with the top five gifts for drivers, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“These ‘gifts’ are simple yet potentially life-saving tips for anyone getting behind the wheel this summer,” Mr Foss says.

“The Kiwi road trip, a great holiday tradition, often involves travelling long distances on unfamiliar roads.  We can help ensure our loved ones are around for many more holidays to come by reminding them how to keep themselves and others safe.”

Remind the driver in your life to:

- Drive sober
- Stick within the speed limit
- Wear a seatbelt
- Take regular rest breaks
- Be patient – it’s not a race.

Mr Foss says drivers should also remember the road is a shared space.

“If you’re towing a caravan or trailer, be courteous, pull over when you can and let faster traffic pass.  If you’re behind a slower vehicle or a cyclist, only pass when it’s safe to do so.

“Don’t risk your life, or hurting your family, friends and others for the sake of getting to your destination a perceived few minutes earlier.

“When we all take care out there the road toll is lower and so is the social cost to our families, friends and communities,” Mr Foss says.

The official holiday period begins at 4pm Wednesday 24 December 2014 and ends at 6am Monday 5 January 2015.
