Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee will visit Fiji today in an initial move towards rebuilding defence co-operation and engagement between New Zealand and Fiji.

“Following their successful elections on 17 September, Cabinet has agreed to lift the last remaining targeted measures against Fiji,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This will allow Defence to move toward rebuilding cooperation.”

Mr Brownlee will be accompanied on the visit by the Vice Chief of Defence Force Air Vice Marshal Kevin Short and Deputy Secretary Defence Tony Lynch.

During the visit Mr Brownlee will meet with his counterpart the Fijian Minister of Defence Hon Timoci Natuva and Minister of Foreign Affairs Hon Ratu Inoke Kubuabola to discuss rebuilding the defence relationship.

Mr Brownlee will also lay a wreath at the Fijian National War Memorial in memory of the 31 New Zealanders interred there.  He will return on Thursday.
