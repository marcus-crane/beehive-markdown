Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest report on mental health services in New Zealand shows improvements in access to care.

“The Office of the Director of Mental Health’s annual report shows a decline in waiting times for people accessing mental health care,” says Dr Coleman.

“This improvement in waiting times was in a year when a record number of people were able to receive care, and it is a tribute to the dedicated people who work in this often challenging part of the health system.”

In 2013, 154,378 New Zealanders engaged with a mental health or addiction service. 91 per cent received their care in the community and 78 per cent of new clients were seen within three weeks of referral for non-urgent services.

Providing a quality and timely mental health service has been a priority for this Government. Funding for mental health and addiction services has increased from $1.1 billion in 2008/2009 to over $1.3 billion in 2013/14.

“For the first time the report includes a snapshot of how people assess the care they are receiving – with 80 per cent people saying they were satisfied,” says Dr Coleman.

“The report acknowledges the areas where there is room for further improvements, such as the use of seclusion for seriously unwell patients which we are already seeing being used less.”

The report also for the first time includes Health, Quality And Safety Commission data on serious adverse events that have occurred in mental health service settings.
