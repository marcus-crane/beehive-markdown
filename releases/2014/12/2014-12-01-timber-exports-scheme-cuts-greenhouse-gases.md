Associate Minister for Primary Industries Jo Goodhew has welcomed the implementation of a programme that allows timber products to be exported to Australia without chemical treatment.

“After a successful trial last summer, the Secure Pathway Programme has been opened up to industry in a bid to reduce the use of methyl bromide during the flight season of the burnt pine longhorn beetle,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“All exporters now have a new option for treating products such as sawn timber, timber mouldings, panel products and veneer sheets.

“The alternative process creates a physical barrier between the wood product and this wood boring beetle, preventing infestation and reducing the usage of methyl bromide.”

Methyl bromide is an ozone depleting gas often used as a fumigant for import and export cargo.

“In the past methyl bromide has been the dominant treatment for wood products bound for the Australian market. New Zealand is committed to steadily reducing its use wherever possible,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The Ministry of Primary Industries has worked with its Australian counterparts to eliminate the use of this damaging gas while ensuring the effectiveness of export treatments.”

This new non-chemical treatment method is available for timber exports to Australia during the summer flight season which runs from October through to April.
