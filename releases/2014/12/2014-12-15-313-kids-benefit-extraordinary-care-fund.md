More than 300 children and young people have benefited from the first round of the Extraordinary Care Fund, Social Development Minister Anne Tolley confirmed today.

“The Extraordinary Care Fund recognises the job grandparents and extended family members do raising children who come into their care, often because of the death of a parent or because of abuse or neglect.

“We’ve funded extra tutoring for kids struggling in school, orthodontic work not funded by the Ministry of Health, covered costs to attend national regional sports tournaments, and music lessons where the child was progressing ahead of their peers.”

All but 36 applications were successful in this inaugural funding round.

“Raising vulnerable children who’ve already had a rough start to life is hard work and many of these carers have opened their homes after already raising their own children.

“We’re providing a bit of extra support so the children they are caring for have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to thrive, achieve, and belong.” Mrs Tolley says.

Grants are available for up to $2,000 per child and this round of funding distributed more than $360,000. 

The second round of the Extraordinary Care Fund opens in January 2015. An additional three funding rounds are planned for the 2015/16 financial year.
