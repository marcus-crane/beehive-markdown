The report of the Ministerial Forum on Alcohol Advertising and Sponsorship has been released today, with Ministers noting that further work will be required on the feasibility and impact of the proposals.

The Forum was established earlier this year to advise on possible further controls on alcohol advertising and sponsorship. The report makes 14 recommendations to Justice Minister Amy Adams and Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne.

“The Forum’s report raises a number of questions, particularly around understanding the full effect of the proposals which the forum themselves note they have been unable to consider.  These issues will need to be addressed before Ministers can properly consider the recommendations,” says Ms Adams.

“These are complex issues, and a thorough quantification of the implications of the proposals is critical. Accordingly, Ministers have asked officials to undertake further work and provide further information by mid-next year.”

Mr Dunne said it was now important to consult with organisations and community groups interested in this issue to ensure the Forum’s findings are fully assessed.

“Over the weeks ahead, officials will be engaging with key stakeholder organisations and groups to gain a better understanding of the impact that recommendations in the report might have, should they be implemented by the Government. That process should be considered and objective rather than hurried and emotive,” says Mr Dunne.

**Further background:** The Forum was established in February 2014 in response to submissions on alcohol advertising and sponsorship made during the alcohol law reform process that led to the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012. The Forum had six appointed members with backgrounds in sport, health, advertising, and academia. It sought information from the public through a six-week submission period.
