Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the vote from secondary school principals on two key elements of the Investing in Educational Success initiative.

Ms Parata says the new leadership role across communities of schools and the principal recruitment allowance are important parts of the $359 million plan to lift educational achievement.

“The principals’ vote follows the strong support from secondary teachers for the new teaching roles we will also have when communities of schools begin operating from the first term of next year.

“The clear endorsement from the secondary sector shows it understands the real potential of IES to lift kids’ achievement through sharing the very best of what happens in classrooms across all schools.”

Ms Parata says IES also recognises and supports stronger career pathways for teachers and principals.

“That helps ensure that we retain the very best skills, knowledge and expertise in our classrooms, as well as in the leadership of our schools.

“That’s an absolute win-win for the kids, parents, the profession and our country as a whole.”

Ms Parata says she expects to shortly approve the first communities of schools, with over 60 expressions of interest received already.
