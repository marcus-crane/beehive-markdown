Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the passing of the Countering Terrorist Fighters Legislation Bill in Parliament tonight.

The legislation was passed with the support of the Labour Party, Act and United Future.

The Bill responds to the rapidly evolving threat posed by the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and growing international terrorism, and will enhance the safety and security of New Zealand.

“The threats faced by New Zealand have grown and it is important that we have the ability to respond to that,” says Mr Key.

“The government has a responsibility to protect New Zealanders at home and abroad and this legislation, passed with the support of a range of political parties, will better enable us to do that.”

The Bill will be subject to a sunset clause following a wider review of the intelligence agencies, their legislation and their oversight, which will begin next year.
