Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga and Minister for Disability Issues Nicky Wagner today congratulated the winners of the Attitude Awards, being held on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will present the Attitude ACC Supreme Award at the ceremony in Auckland tonight.

The Attitude Awards recognise the huge number of New Zealanders who live with disabilities, including those with intellectual, physical and mental health disabilities.

“I congratulate all the winners and finalists,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga. “These awards showcase the positive contributions made by some outstanding New Zealanders and reveal the depth of exceptional talent in the disability sector.

“I am also proud of employers who choose to employ people with disabilities to allow them to earn and contribute to society.

“Some of the nominees are well known public figures. Others are unsung heroes. What they all have in common is that they have risen to the challenge and not let disability hold them back from their chosen endeavour.”

“The disability sector is telling us loud and clear that disabled people want the same opportunities as everyone else, including having a job,” Ms Wagner says.

“Tonight’s Awards are a great opportunity not only to celebrate achievement across the disability sector, but also to acknowledge the organisations and employers who help to foster this achievement.”

Almost one in four – or 1.1 million – New Zealanders live with some form of disability.

The Attitude Awards are the only national awards that celebrate achievement in the disability sector across all disabilities. They are intended to support the Government’s objectives of a fully inclusive society and promote positive perceptions of disability.

ACC is the principal sponsor of the Attitude Awards, as well as sponsor of the Attitude ACC Employer Award and Attitude ACC Supreme Award. A range of awards are presented, including for sport, arts, youth and employment.
