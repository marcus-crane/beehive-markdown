Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed this morning’s announcement that the United States and Cuba intend to re-establish diplomatic relations after 53 years.

“New Zealand supports this decision which is a significant step forward for both countries and the region,” Mr McCully says.

“To make progress on such a long standing issue shows willingness from both sides to overcome a long history of tension, and I congratulate Presidents Obama and Castro.

“The trade embargo which remains in place against Cuba is a handbrake not only for economic relations between the US and Cuba but for the wider Caribbean region.

“The move to re-establish diplomatic relations heralds a new era for US/Cuba relations and we hope both parties can go further and take the necessary steps to normalise their economic relationship.  

“New Zealand already has diplomatic ties with Cuba. I have visited Havana twice and the Cuban Foreign Minister visited New Zealand in September this year.

“New Zealand and Cuba have also entered into a formal partnership which sees us working  to support sustainable development in the Pacific region and we look forward to further cooperation in this area,” Mr McCully says.
