Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced an Advisory Board on Transition with a wealth of experience and knowledge about the recovery needs of greater Christchurch.

“The board, chaired by Dame Jenny Shipley, will provide me with a range of advice about the transition of functions and powers held by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) to other agencies as the recovery progresses,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It will provide a clear voice for local government and the various sectors of Christchurch as we look ahead to the next stages of the recovery.”

Others on the board are:

- Lianne Dalziel, representing Christchurch City Council
- Dame Margaret Bazley, representing Environment Canterbury
- Tā Mark Solomon, representing Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu
- Kelvin Coe, representing Selwyn District Council
- David Ayers, representing Waimakariri District Council
- Darren Wright, representing the community sector
- Leanne Curtis, representing the community sector
- Maggy Tai Rakena, representing the not for profit sector
- Peter Townsend, representing the business sector
- Gill Cox, representing the business sector
- Mary Devine, representing the business sector

Mr Brownlee says the board will meet for the first time in January, and will wind up in December next year.  The frequency of meetings will depend on the workload.    

“As I signalled from the inception of CERA, there will be a gradual transition of recovery responsibilities, including the removal or scaling back of powers provided for by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act that are no longer deemed necessary to maintain the momentum of the recovery.”

The Act is due to expire in April 2016.

“On February 1 next year, CERA will move from being a stand-alone Government department to a Departmental Agency within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.  This is an important first step in the transition and will position CERA alongside the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management to share the lessons of the recovery for the future management of natural disasters,” Mr Brownlee says.

“A transition plan will be put in place to hand over responsibility and powers from CERA to local government and other government agencies or delivery vehicles, and the advisory board will also provide advice to me on the formation of this plan.

“The transition does not signal the Government winding down its commitment to greater Christchurch, which remains as strong as ever.

“There will be a need for the Government to oversee some recovery programmes beyond 2016.

“But with this hugely experienced board appointed I’m confident the transition of the Government’s role in greater Christchurch’s recovery will happen in a sensible and phased way to ensure momentum is maintained.”
