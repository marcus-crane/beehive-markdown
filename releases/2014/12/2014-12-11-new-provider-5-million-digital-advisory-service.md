Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that CORE Education has been chosen to deliver the Ministry of Education’s new Learning Technologies Advisory (LTA) Service.

A total of $5 million will be invested in the service over three years, starting in 2015.

“This service is about helping teachers take advantage of digital technology to enhance learning in our schools.

“The world is now awash with digital resources, such as interactive, online learning tools, that can help make teaching and learning more engaging and more effective.

“Through the LTA service, teachers will have access to a team of experts, who can offer help and ideas on how to use technology to maximum effect in the classroom.

“The team will also proactively alert schools to technology related opportunities, and encourage teachers to collaborate to share ideas and practices.”

From July 2014, crown company ‘Network for Learning’ provided an interim advisory service to schools receiving internet services over its managed network.

CORE Education, which offers a range of e-based learning and development services, will deliver the LTA service to all schools from 2015 on.

A recent survey showed that around 70% of schools believe digital technologies positively affect teaching and learning, but only 14% feel all their teachers have the necessary skills to manage digital resources for learning.

“The Government has already invested in ultra-fast broadband and network upgrades, and many schools now have fully-funded, high quality internet access.

“The LTA service will help ensure teachers have the skills and knowledge to make the most of this technology platform.

“The rapidly evolving digital world makes this an exciting time for education, and it’s important we help educators and students tap into that world, to create engaging ways to learn.”
