Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced that 25 projects to improve safety at racecourses across New Zealand will be receiving grants worth $703,596.

The money is coming from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety, with matching dollar-for-dollar contributions from racing clubs.

“This year’s first funding round has supported a wide range of infrastructure projects including safety running rails, new starting gates, toilet facilities upgrades, and a greyhound kennel block extension,” says Mr Guy.

“The fund continues to make a major contribution to the safety of the racing industry for animals, industry participants and the public.”

The next funding round for 2014/15 will open on 1 February 2015 with applications closing on 30 March 2015.

“I encourage all racing clubs, and the respective code bodies, to take advantage of this funding if they have safety issues that need to be addressed.”
