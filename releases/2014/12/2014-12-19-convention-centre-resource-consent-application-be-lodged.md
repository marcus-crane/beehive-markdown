Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed SkyCity’s planned submission today of a resource consent application for the construction of the New Zealand International Convention Centre (NZICC).

“This is an important step toward achieving an international-standard convention centre in central Auckland,” Mr Joyce says.

“The centre will drive a significant increase in tourism expenditure through the estimated 33,000 additional convention delegates that it is expected to bring to Auckland each year.”

The Crown and SkyCity have been working collaboratively on a design for a building that will enhance the central Auckland urban landscape and ensure that New Zealand is able to compete effectively with Australia and Asia to attract high-value business visitors.

Predicted inflation has played a significant part in the identification, during the current phase of the design process, of an increase in the $402 million land and construction cost contained in the New Zealand International Convention Centre Agreement.

“The Crown expects that the cost differential, in the range of $70 million to $130 million, will be addressed through a combination of value management savings and a rigorous and competitive procurement process,” Mr Joyce says. “Other funding options for addressing any outstanding difference in value would be considered if required.

“Any such options would not involve granting SkyCity more or different gambling concessions, or making further changes to any legislation that affects casinos or gambling.”

Under the terms of the NZICC Agreement, SkyCity manages the design process and the resource consent application.
