Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye confirmed today that $23.5 million of funding has been approved towards the second stage of redevelopment of Southern Cross Campus.

 

Southern Cross is a decile 1, co-ed state school for years 1 to 13 in Māngere, Auckland.

 

“This is about fulfilling the Government’s commitment to prioritise several major school redevelopments in Auckland.

 

“Work can now proceed on high-priority work, such as building a new multipurpose centre, teaching block and administration facilities at the school.

 

“I have asked the Ministry of Education to work with the school on a potential third stage of redevelopment, which will involve upgrading older buildings.

 

“I have also asked the Ministry to ensure that the master plan for redevelopment allows for the integration of any future work that may be carried out.”

 

Stage One of redevelopment has seen construction start on a new trades academy, offering programmes in careers such as construction and hospitality.

 

“The Government is committed to investing in education in South Auckland, and over the last six years, has spent over $150 million enhancing existing schools there.

 

“Southern Cross, with its trades academy and satellite of Sir Keith Park Special School, is an important school in the area.

 

“When all the redevelopment work is finished, Southern Cross will be a wonderful village of learning and a jewel in the local community.”
