Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew is reminding students to apply for their 2015 Student Allowance and Loan by Tuesday 16 December.

“More than 60,000 students have applied for allowances and loans in the last two months. This is a good start, but with one week to go we’re aiming to exceed the 90,000 students who had applied by 16 December last year,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“At this rate we expect there to be around 190,000 applications by the start of the 2015 academic year. Students could find themselves waiting for up to eight weeks or more for StudyLink approval if they don’t get organised now and apply before the early application deadline.”

Mrs Goodhew encourages parents to get involved in the application process, particularly for first time students.  “Going into tertiary study is a big decision and there are online tools available, particularly the Sussed Online tool to help first time students make sound financial decisions.”

This year StudyLink has made reapplying even easier for returning students, whose applications will be pre-filled with most of the information they provided last time they applied. Students just need to check and update their details.

“Improving interaction with government is one of our better Public Service targets, and StudyLink has shown a great commitment to improving the online tools and services for students,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Reapplying now only takes about five minutes, and students can even check their details on their mobile phones. With one week to go until early applications close on 16 December, there is no excuse for students not to have their ducks in a row.”

Students can find out more about the application process on the StudyLink website ([www.studylink.govt.nz](http://www.studylink.govt.nz)).
