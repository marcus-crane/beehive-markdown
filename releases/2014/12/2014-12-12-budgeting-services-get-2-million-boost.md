Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says new government investment of $2 million will bolster community budgeting services.

As part of Budget 2014 the Government announced new operating funding of $22 million over the next four years to help New Zealanders with money management skills.  This is in addition to the $9 million that the government invests annually in budgeting.

“Budgeting Services received a $1.5 million top-up earlier this year to help with growing demand,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Today I’m announcing new additional funding of $2 million for 97 community groups.

“A quarter of this new funding is aimed at encouraging innovation in budgeting services and eight organisations will pilot programmes in Northland, Auckland,  the central North Island, greater Wellington and Canterbury regions with $400,000 of the funding.

“The pilots will see budgeting services provided in new ways including virtually, in libraries and schools as well as delivering to new groups including people on community-based sentences. 

“Families find themselves in need of budgeting assistance for many different reasons.  The Government’s increased funding of budget services will help people manage their finances better to avoid debt traps and improve their financial decision-making.  It’s a sound investment in people’s futures,” says Mrs Tolley.
