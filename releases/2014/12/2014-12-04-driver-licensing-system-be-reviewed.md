Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss today announced a review of parts of New Zealand’s driver licensing system.

“A lot has changed since the current driver licensing system was introduced in 1999.  The review will look at modernising the system by making it more customer-focused and reducing compliance costs,” Mr Foss says.

“It will consider whether the heavy vehicle driver licensing process could be simplified by reducing the number of heavy vehicle classes and related endorsements.”

Mr Foss says while fundamental elements of the licensing system will not be reviewed, such as the photo driver licence and the minimum licensing age, there are a number of opportunities to make the system easier to understand and use.

“For example, the review is an opportunity to consider online licence renewals and whether the full licence test needs to evolve, given the recent changes to make the restricted test more difficult,” Mr Foss says.

Any proposed changes to the law will be consulted on and progressed in 2016.
