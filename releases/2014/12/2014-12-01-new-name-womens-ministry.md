Minister for Women Louise Upston has announced a name change for the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, which will represent the Ministry’s work in a more modern way.

“In October the Prime Minister announced new names for several portfolios and following on from this, I am pleased to announce that from today the Ministry of Women’s Affairs will officially be the Ministry for Women.

 “For 30 years we have had a dedicated Ministry that has made great progress in increasing opportunities for women in employment and leadership, as well as introducing policies to increase women’s safety.

“It is an honour for me as Minister to be involved with the next stages of progress, and to achieve benefits for not only women, but for their families and the future of New Zealand.

“Women should have every opportunity made available to them to realise their potential. I am looking forward to working with the Ministry to increase the opportunities for women to be leaders, as well as encouraging economic independence for women of all ages. We will also continue to work to increase women’s safety.

“The Ministry will begin to use the new name immediately and take the required steps to implement the formal name change processes in the most cost-effective manner.

“This change also aligns with the Ministry’s office move this week, representing a new beginning for the Ministry,” Ms Upston says.
