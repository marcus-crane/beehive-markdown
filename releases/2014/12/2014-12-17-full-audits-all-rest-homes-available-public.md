Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has announced that full audit reports for all rest homes will be published online from today in a more reader-friendly format.

This follows a year long trial in which 574 full audits were published on the Ministry of Health website.

“The trial has shown the benefit of having the full reports available and publishing will now continue in an improved format,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga. “I am delighted that we have been able to achieve our aim of having these comprehensive reports available by the end of 2014.

“People will be able to continue accessing complete details of rest home audits, giving them all the information they need about how a home is performing.

“This information is important in helping older people and their families make informed decisions about their care and living environment.”

Full audit reports have been published on a trial basis since the end of 2013. The Government committed to continuing the arrangement following positive feedback from the public and organisations including Age Concern, Grey Power and Consumer New Zealand.

Shorter summaries of the audit findings have been available online since 2009.

“Audits are conducted regularly to ensure our rest homes meet the necessary standards and all those undertaken from now will be published in full.”

All rest homes are independently audited against 50 standards and require certification to ensure they provide safe and effective care. The audit reports identify any risks and areas where the homes need to improve.

From today all new audit information will be available at [www.health.govt.nz/resthomes](http://www.health.govt.nz/resthomes)
