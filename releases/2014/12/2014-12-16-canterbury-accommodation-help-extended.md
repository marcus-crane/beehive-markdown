Social Development Minister Anne Tolley announced today that the Temporary Accommodation Assistance (TAA) programme for Canterbury quake victims would be extended.

The TAA was initiated following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, to support homeowners with additional costs caused by the need to reside in temporary accommodation while waiting for repairs to their homes to be completed.

“Due to end in March next year, today’s announcement sees this on-going assistance extended until the end of October 2015 for those residents in Canterbury who are still waiting to get their properties assessed and repaired,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Since the programme started, almost 3000 households have received assistance. Of those, just over 2000 have since moved off the programme as their property has been repaired.  Currently 733 households are receiving assistance through the TAA, 55 in the red zone and 678 in the Green zone. 

“To date more than $46 million has been paid to homeowners through the TAA.

“This programme has made a real difference for those still struggling in the aftermath of the earthquakes, and I will make a further assessment on the need for the continuation of the programme towards the middle of next year,” says Mrs Tolley.
