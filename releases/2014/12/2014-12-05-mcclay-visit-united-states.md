Associate Trade Minister Todd McClay will address the New Zealand Honorary Consul Conference of the Western USA and Hawaii in Los Angeles on Monday.

The opening address is one of a number of visits and meetings in his Revenue, Associate Trade and Associate Foreign Affairs portfolios.

Mr McClay will also visit the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Global Access Programme.

“The UCLA Global Access Programme gives New Zealand companies access to teams of MBA students who help them with market research. This is one of the ways New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, which has partnered with the programme for more than seven years, provides support for companies with new growth opportunities.

“More than 90 New Zealand companies have successfully completed the programme,” says Mr McClay.

Mr McClay will visit Orion Health’s Los Angeles office.

“Orion is one of New Zealand’s largest software exporters and a real success story. They are committed to remaining a New Zealand company but have real global reach, employing 1,100 staff in 27 offices around the world.”

Mr McClay will also visit Revenue Departments in the states of Ohio, Georgia and Florida.
