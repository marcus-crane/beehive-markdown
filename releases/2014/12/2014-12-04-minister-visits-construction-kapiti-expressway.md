Transport Minister Simon Bridges was today joined by Hon Nathan Guy, MP for Ōtaki, and project staff to mark the one year anniversary of construction starting on the MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway on the Kapiti Coast, north of Wellington.

The expressway will be 4-lanes and 18 kilometres in length, and will include an end-to-end cycleway, walkway and bridleway.  It will be an important piece of infrastructure that will significantly improve the connection between the Capital and the Kapiti Coast.

“The $540 million project, part of the $2.4 billion Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance, will make journeys shorter, easier and safer between Wellington and the lower North Island.

“Once completed in 2017, the expressway will foster better economic growth and productivity, and provide the standard of highway network that the Wellington region deserves,” Mr Bridges says.

“Progress after the first year on the construction of the MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway is strong, with the project providing a shot in the arm for the local Kapiti economy.

“The work taking place on the project is building the capacity of local businesses and providing employment and training opportunities for local people.

“Over half of the contractor’s spending for suppliers and subcontractors to date has been with local Kapiti businesses, with over $110 million in orders having been placed with local and regional companies.

“Nearly 400 people are employed on the project, rising to 600 next year, and this doesn’t count the jobs that have been created with suppliers and through local businesses.

“I’m delighted to see that the project is also kick-starting careers and fostering an enduring skill base for the region by growing the skilled local workforce in partnership with Whitireia and Weltec to recruit local graduates,” Mr Bridges says.
