New measures to keep dangerous criminals locked up for longer and better protect victims will soon come into force.

This follows the passing of the Public Safety (Public Protection Orders) Bill which passed with a high level of cross-party support. The Bill enables the High Court to make a public protection order (PPO) to detain high-risk individuals until they no longer pose a serious and imminent threat to public safety.

The PPO Bill was passed alongside the Parole (Extended Supervision Orders) Amendment Bill, which extends supervision for high risk offenders in our community.

Justice Minister Amy Adams says the passing of the Bill means a greater assurance of safety from the harm posed by our worst offenders.

“Despite serving prison terms, some dangerous offenders may reoffend once they have been released. These new measures will allow authorities to more effectively deal with those who pose a serious threat to the community,” says Ms Adams.

Individuals subject to a PPO will live in a residence on prison grounds, separate from the main buildings but within a secure perimeter. 

“Public safety is paramount. The aim of public protection orders is to keep the public safe from people who pose a very high risk of imminent serious sexual or violent offending.

“The new orders will apply in situations where existing measures, such as parole conditions and extended supervision orders, don’t go far enough to keep a community safe,” says Ms Adams.

**About Public Protection Orders (PPOs):**

PPOs allow civil detention in a residence on prison grounds for a specific group of serious sexual or violent offenders.  These are offenders who have completed sentences for serious sexual or violent offending either in New Zealand or overseas, or are subject to the most intensive form of extended supervision order, but continue to pose a very high risk of imminent and serious sexual or violent reoffending.
