Police Minister Michael Woodhouse today congratulated Police for the latest successful drug-related operation targeting gang members in the Upper North Island.

Operation Jakarta was the fourth in a series, resulting in charges being laid against 38 Headhunter members and associates, as well as the seizure of over $4 million in cash, $4 million-worth of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals, and a substantial number of firearms.

More than $9 million worth of assets were also frozen under the Criminal Proceeds Recovery Act.

"These operations were terminated due to the great work of Police districts and the Organised and Financial Crime Agency New Zealand (OFCANZ), and I commend their efforts," Mr Woodhouse says.

“The fact that these operations resulted in such a significant seizure of drugs, guns and cash shows that what Police are doing to reduce the harm that methamphetamine causes in our community is working.

"Criminals need to know that drug activities will not be tolerated in our communities, and any profits or assets from these atrocious activities will be seized. The results of these operations go a long way in sending that message.

"The Government is committed to reducing the harm caused by gangs and transnational crime groups, through our whole-of-government action plan to clamp down on gang activity.

“Our multi-agency approach involving intelligence-gathering, enhanced law enforcement, prevention and intervention will make a real difference in cracking down on the manufacturing and supplying of illicit drugs.”
