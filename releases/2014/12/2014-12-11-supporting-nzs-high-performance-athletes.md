Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes High Performance Sport New Zealand’s investment in national sport organisations for the next financial year.

“The investment decisions announced today by High Performance Sport New Zealand mean our top athletes will continue to make their presence felt on the world stage,” says Dr Coleman.

“It locks in the support our elite athletes need as they work towards success at key events next year and the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympic Games.

“Our tier one sports - rowing, cycling and yachting - will get a large share of this investment as they have the greatest potential for winning multiple medals.”

Over the four year Olympic cycle leading into Rio, High Performance Sport New Zealand is investing almost $130 million into the high performance programmes it supports.

An additional $72 million goes into direct support for athletes such as performance enhancement grants, Prime Minister’s Scholarships, expert advice and technological support.

Over the past few years the Government has significantly increased its investment in high performance sport to a budget of around $62 million a year.

“We are really proud to be able to support our top Kiwi athletes. It is inspiring to see New Zealanders do so well on the world stage. They are also great role models for our next generation of athletes, and can inspire the rest of us to become more active and healthy,” says Dr Coleman.
