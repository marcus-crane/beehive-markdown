Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today launched a national three year Cancer Plan at Wellington Hospital.

“From prevention and early detection, to diagnosis and treatment and follow-up care - an enormous amount has been achieved in cancer services over the last six years,” says Dr Coleman.

“The New Zealand Cancer Plan 2015-2018 brings all this work together and signals activities that need to happen over the next three years to ensure people with cancer receive even better, faster care.”

A key focus of the Cancer Plan is the new 62-day Faster Cancer Treatment Target.

The new national target monitors the patient’s whole journey - from the tests and investigations needed to confirm a cancer diagnosis, through to all forms of first treatment, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

“Focusing on this 62-day timeframe helps to streamline care, reduce delays, and identify where the cancer pathway is working well and where improvements can be made,” says Dr Coleman.

DHBs are introducing new initiatives to support the 62-day target, for example:

- Capital & Coast DHB, in conjunction with Hutt Valley and Wairarapa DHBs, is developing localised clinical pathways for GPs to follow when referring patients with suspected cancer to secondary services, to promote and optimise organised and efficient care.
- At Lakes DHB a new electronic system using traffic light colour-coding means clinicians can monitor patients’ progress. They have also appointed a specialist nurse to help fast track patients with suspected bowel cancer.
- Patients with suspected lung cancer in Hawkes Bay DHB now have CT scans prior to their first specialist appointment.

The new target will be supported by the Faster Cancer Treatment Programme, which is also detailed in the Cancer Plan.
