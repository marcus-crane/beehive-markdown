Education Minister Hekia Parata has thanked parents, whānau and staff across the education sector for their passion and commitment to making sure all kids get the best possible education.

“We’re making great progress with kids starting earlier in education, staying longer, and leaving better qualified, and we have built on that throughout this year.

“That wouldn’t be possible without parents and whānau making sure their kids are attending early childhood education or school, and then having dedicated professionals in place providing those kids with the right skills and knowledge.

“I want to thank everyone for their hard work throughout 2014 and wish them all the very best for the holidays as they spend time with whānau and friends.

“We’ll have another 70,000 new entrants turning up at school next year, and I’m absolutely committed to making sure that we’re giving every single one of our kids the opportunity to do their very best and be successful in life.”

Ms Parata says the first communities of schools that start operating from term one of 2015 have real potential to lift educational outcomes as well as providing school teachers and principals with stronger career pathways.
