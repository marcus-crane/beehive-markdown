Social Development Minister Anne Tolley today launched a new episode of the innovative online drama Common Ground, part of the Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health Project.

Written by Go-Girls writer Sam Shore, Common Ground is designed to encourage conversations about key issues affecting young people’s wellbeing.

The latest episode, In Memory, features Sophie, a young girl struggling to cope with the loss of her mum, and her family who are trying to support her.

In Memory shows how while family are often the first to notice when young people are dealing with emotional stress, they often find it hard to know how to connect with and support them.

“This is exactly why Common Ground was set up – to be a place for parents, family, and friends to go to for information and support,” Mrs Tolley says.

The Common Ground project also includes a website, a free phone line, social media channels, and links to other services and resources. It is being developed in collaboration between the Mental Health Foundation, Youthline, Skylight, Curative, and Innovate Change.

“Common Ground shows what can be achieved when we work together to tackle the complex issue of youth mental health. 

“Encouraging conversation around youth mental health is important to reduce stigma and make it easier for young people to get help.” Mrs Tolley said.
