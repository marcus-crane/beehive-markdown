Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated the New Zealanders who have received New Year Honours for their services to education.

Ms Parata says committed and passionate people are working in education throughout the country, and it’s wonderful to see some of the very best honoured.

“I congratulate the 2015 recipients for their immense contribution to education in New Zealand and internationally.

“It’s wonderful they’ve been publicly recognised and honoured for their work, from early childhood education through to later schooling and education.

“This is a reflection of the extremely high value that New Zealand places on education.”

Ms Parata says in particular she wants to congratulate Brother Sir Patrick Lynch, KNZM, QSO on his knighthood.

“He has made an outstanding contribution nationally and internationally in many education roles and this honour is highly fitting.”
