Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says 82 New Zealanders have registered their interest in joining the international fight against Ebola.

“There has been a very high level of response from New Zealanders who are keen to support the Australian-flagged mission to Sierra Leone to operate a 100-bed Ebola treatment centre,” says Dr Coleman.

“People with a range of skills have registered, including nurses, GPs, pharmacists, and administrators.”

While the initial period for expressions of interest closes today, people can continue to submit applications via the Ministry of Health’s website.

The Government announced on 17 November 2014 that it will facilitate the deployment of up to 24 New Zealanders as part of New Zealand’s $2 million practical contribution to international efforts to combat Ebola in West Africa.

“The Australian Government has contracted Aspen Medical, a private medical provider, to select, train, contract and deploy the volunteers,” says Dr Coleman.

“Aspen will contact prospective volunteers directly to discuss their suitability once all the details of the deployment have been confirmed.

“The first deployment of New Zealand based personnel is expected to take place in the new year.”
