Visible rebuild progress in Christchurch is helping to boost people’s quality of life, says Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Nicky Wagner.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority’s fifth Wellbeing Survey has found overall quality of life in Greater Christchurch continues to improve, and for some, tangible signs of progress and access to new and repaired recreational facilities is a part of this.

“The quality of life results have been steadily tracking upwards and we are now at a point where 77 per cent of people in the community are reporting their quality of life is good or very good,” Ms Wagner said.

The Wellbeing Survey reports: ‘a significant lift in optimism and positive responses among residents’.

“I’m very mindful that some people are still stressed and some groups, including people with unresolved insurance claims, people with ill health or disabilities, and low-income households continue to face challenges during the recovery.

“I know the insurance sector and EQC are working hard to address the unresolved claims – which now tend to be the most difficult and complex.

“People are more positive and quality of life is improving, however there are support services in place for those who need them, such as the Residential Advisory Service (RAS). This is a very effective service that is free to everyone and will help guide the homeowner through tough situations.

“The infrastructure rebuild is also making a noticeable difference, with fewer people reporting transport-related stress than in the previous survey – 15 per cent, down from 22 per cent.”

The Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT) is already 57 per cent through its work programme, with 76 per cent of its inner city work completed.

“It is heartening that most people are enjoying a good quality of life in Christchurch despite everything we have been through, and things will only get better with such an exciting future for the city,” Ms Wagner said.
