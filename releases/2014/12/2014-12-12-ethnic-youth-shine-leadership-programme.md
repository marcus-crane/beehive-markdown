Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has congratulated a group of young ethnic New Zealanders who have completed a programme aimed at building future public sector leaders.

Fifty-five young people from 24 different ethnic groups completed the Young Leaders Programme this year and many have already gained jobs in government departments.

“This programme aims to harness the leadership potential of our ethnic communities,” says Mr Lotu-liga.  “It was set up in response to New Zealand’s growing ethnic population, who are currently under-represented in senior leadership roles.

“We need to do more to encourage New Zealanders of diverse backgrounds to take up management roles in the public service.  This programme helps our talented young leaders gain a better understanding of how government works and prepares them to become tomorrow’s leaders, policy makers, service providers and decision makers.”

The Young Leaders Programme started in 2012 and is run by the Office of Ethnic Affairs.  It has proved popular with ethnic youth and there are currently more applicants than places.  This year’s participants came from many different ethnic backgrounds, including Indian, Chinese, Somalian and Kurdish.

One in four New Zealanders was born overseas and more than half of ethnic New Zealanders are aged under 24, compared with 35% of the general population.

“To reflect this increasing diversity, it is essential that young ethnic leaders play a more active role in shaping the New Zealand of tomorrow,” says Mr Lotu-liga.

The Young Leaders Programme is open to New Zealand citizens or permanent residents aged 16-24 who are migrants, refugees, long-term settlers or New Zealand-born and who identify their ethnic heritage as Asian, Continental European, Middle Eastern, Latin American or African.  Sessions are held in Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch and Hamilton and cover high performance leadership, project management, intercultural awareness and communication training.  Participants also do work experience in a government department.
