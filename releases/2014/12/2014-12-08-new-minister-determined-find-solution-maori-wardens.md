Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell acknowledges the need for Māori wardens to find a durable solution to the complex set of issues facing the organisation in its management and administration.

The Waitangi Tribunal released a 600 page report today on the Crown's review of the Māori Community Development Act 1962 and the role of the Māori wardens.

"I acknowledge the Tribunal's report and its findings that the Crown breached the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi through its review of the Māori Community Development Act 1962, and its administration of the Māori Warden's Project.

"The Tribunal also acknowledged there are ongoing challenges with the implementation of the 52 year law and it should be reviewed," says Mr Flavell.

He says his primary concern is to find a relevant and robust solution to the management and administration of the Māori wardens.

"Wardens are greatly respected in their communities and that needs to be the focus.

"The release of the report doesn't change the fact that some Māori wardens and the New Zealand Māori Council are divided about the best way forward and herein lies the challenge," says Mr Flavell.

As the Māori Development Minister, Mr Flavell has an ongoing legislative mandate and responsibility to the Maori wardens.  He's keen to take more time to fully consider the Waitangi Tribunal report and meet directly with the various parties.

"The report is enormous, and encompasses a range of policy decisions, technical comment and specific suggestions for Maori Wardens and the New Zealand Maori Council which we will want to give deep consideration too before any further comment can be made.”
