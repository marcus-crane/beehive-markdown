The second largest methamphetamine border seizure in New Zealand’s history means a very large quantity of harmful drugs will not make it to New Zealand streets these holidays, says Customs Minister Nicky Wagner.

On 5 December, Customs intercepted approximately 22.6 kilograms of methamphetamine, worth over $22 million. The drugs were hidden in the cargo of an international flight that arrived in Auckland from Taiwan. A joint Customs and Police operation codenamed Operation Georgie was launched.

“Targeting drug imports and dismantling the criminal networks are top priorities for Customs. Stopping this very significant quantity of drugs is sure to leave a dent in the criminal gang’s pocket,” Ms Wagner says.

“I applaud the work of the Customs officers that detected this huge quantity of methamphetamine, which was cleverly concealed. Customs has thwarted another criminal gang and Police have arrested two Taiwanese nationals involved.

“Enforcement agencies will continue to work together in the fight against drugs and organised crime. We will do all it takes to stop these drugs from coming into the country and harming our communities,” Ms Wagner says.
