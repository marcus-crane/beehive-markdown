Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced three new members of the Primary Growth Partnership’s independent Investment Advisory Panel (IAP).

The three new members are primary industry and business specialist Barry Brook, experienced businessman Harry Burkhardt, and entrepreneur Melissa Clark-Reynolds.

“The IAP plays a crucial role in the success of the Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) that aims to boost the value, productivity and profitability of our primary industries,” says Mr Guy. 

“IAP members are responsible for using their expertise and judgement to advise on decisions about the investment of PGP funds, and to help ensure that PGP investments are supporting the overall aims of economic growth and sustainability.

“The new members have experience in a range of areas in New Zealand’s primary, commercial and public sectors, including governance, investment, strategy, technology and innovation.

“MPI ran an open process seeking expressions of interest, which attracted interest from over 100 people.”

The new appointments replace Colin McKenzie and Sharon Hunter, whose terms with the IAP end on 31 December 2014, and Jamie Tuuta, who resigned from the IAP earlier this year.

“I’d like to thank Mr McKenzie, Ms Hunter and Mr Tuuta for their outstanding contributions to the IAP and the wider PGP.

“They have provided valuable expertise over their terms, ensuring that PGP programmes fit with the criteria and that the innovations add significant value to the primary industries and New Zealand.”

Mr Brook, Mr Burkhardt and Ms Clark-Reynolds will join current IAP members Sir Maarten Wevers and Dr Kevin Marshall and Chair Ms Joanna Perry from 2015.

There are currently 16 PGP programmes underway with two recently completed, and around $680 million co-invested by industry and government.
