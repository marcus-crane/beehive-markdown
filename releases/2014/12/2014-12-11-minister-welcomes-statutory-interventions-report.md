Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the recommendations of the Review of Statutory Interventions in State and State Integrated Schools.

The Working Group set up to conduct the review has recommended the Ministry of Education and schools work more closely together.

“We’re committed to raising educational achievement for five out of five kids so we need to make sure all schools operate successfully. The vast majority do, but a small number experience difficulties so they need extra support.

“I’ve asked the Ministry to continue working with the sector to look at how these schools can be supported earlier, which means we can reduce the small number of statutory interventions even further.

“We want to support schools to resolve difficulties themselves and only intervene at a statutory level as a last resort,” says Ms Parata.

Of just under 2,500 state and state integrated schools in New Zealand, fewer than three per cent have a statutory intervention in place. 

The Working Group found that while the sector felt the current statutory intervention framework is working well, it needs to be strengthened.

Ms Parata says the Report’s other recommendations, including process improvements, will also be worked on by the Ministry and others on the Working Group.
