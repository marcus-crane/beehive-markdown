Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed Pipfruit New Zealand onboard as the third industry to join the Government’s biosecurity partnership.

The Deed of the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) for Biosecurity Readiness and Response was signed by Pipfruit New Zealand today.

“This means that apple and pear growers and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) can work closely together and make joint decisions on readiness and response to manage mutual high priority biosecurity pests,” says Mr Guy.

“The apple and pear sector knows the importance of biosecurity and have shown leadership in wanting to develop a partnership with the government. They have recognised the benefits of sitting around the table with MPI and how this can deliver better outcomes.

“Pipfruit New Zealand has already worked with MPI on readiness and response to pests, and has helped with developing an operational agreement for any possible fruit fly incursion.

“I’m delighted that the skills, knowledge and expertise they bring can be better harnessed.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister and this is another important step in strengthening our borders. I’m looking forward to seeing more industries sign up in the future.”

New Zealand Pork and Kiwifruit Vine Health were the first two industries to sign the GIA Deed earlier this year.
