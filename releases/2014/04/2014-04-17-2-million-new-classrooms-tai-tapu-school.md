Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced nearly $2 million funding for new classrooms at Tai Tapu School in rural Canterbury.

“Selwyn district is part of a rapidly growing Canterbury region. The nine new buildings for Tai Tapu School are part of a broader classroom building programme which will address the capacity needs for the region,” Ms Kaye says.

“Three of the classrooms will accommodate roll growth and six will replace older classrooms. All of these will meet modern learning environment standards.”

Tai Tapu School, which takes students from Year 1 to Year 8, received most of the neighbouring Greenpark School’s students when it closed earlier this year. Further growth in the region has also been anticipated in plans for a Stage 2 development at the school.

Ms Kaye says 26 new classrooms for the Selwyn District have been funded in the past 12 months, with a total value of $5.3 million.  The classrooms will help to address changing demographics in the region in the next few years.

“These new classrooms meet modern learning environment standards which is important to raise achievement for children and young people,” Ms Kaye says. “Our vision is to have schools with flexible learning areas, access to ultra-fast broadband and energy efficient building that will serve their communities for many years to come.”
