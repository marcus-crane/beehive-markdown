Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat Marion Crawshaw as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Solomon Islands.

“New Zealand’s close relationship with Solomon Islands has been demonstrated by our response to the recent floods,” Mr McCully says.

“There is still an enormous amount to do in terms of supporting people in evacuation centres and restoring critical infrastructure – our new High Commissioner’s priority will be leading New Zealand’s continued efforts in these areas.

“Last year we marked the 10th anniversary of Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). New Zealand is proud of this on-going contribution to security in Solomon Islands. Currently 17 New Zealand Police are serving as part of RAMSI and we provide the deputy head of RAMSI.

“New Zealand contributes approximately $40 million in aid funding to Solomon Islands each year, with a focus on infrastructure development, education and fisheries support in Solomon Islands.

“We will also be looking at how our aid programme can support the long-term recovery and reconstruction effort in Solomon Islands following the floods earlier this month,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Crawshaw will also be accredited as High Commissioner to Nauru.

Ms Crawshaw served as Deputy High Commissioner to Solomon Islands from 1999 to 2001 and was most recently New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea.
