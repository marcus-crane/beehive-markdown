The Government has released the criteria for the New Zealand Screen Production Grant (NZSPG) that comes into effect from today.

The NZSPG combines the Large Budget Screen Production Grant and Screen Production Incentive Fund into a new grant agreed by Cabinet in December 2013.

The new arrangements introduce a 20 per cent grant for international productions, increasing to 25 per cent in limited circumstances. A 40 per cent grant is being made available for New Zealand productions, and the range of these that will qualify has been increased. For New Zealand grants above $6 million the Crown will benefit from a share of any profits which will be reinvested in the screen sector.

There are a number of criteria that need to be met in order to get the additional 5 per cent for international productions – in particular the wider economic benefits to New Zealand. That includes the marketing, promotion and showcasing of New Zealand and New Zealand expertise as we have seen with The Hobbit films and has been agreed with the makers of the Avatar trilogy.

"The marketing benefits for New Zealand from these sorts of high profile productions underline the New Zealand story of creativity and innovation that benefits our exporters more generally.

The new criteria follows consultation with 150 representatives from the New Zealand and overseas screen industries.

“These changes have been designed to encourage more mid-sized locally-driven productions and attract more international productions while our own local industry develops and becomes more sustainable,” Mr Joyce says.

“Supporting our local screen industry is vital so longer term more New Zealand-made stories can be successful on the world stage,” Mr Finlayson says.
