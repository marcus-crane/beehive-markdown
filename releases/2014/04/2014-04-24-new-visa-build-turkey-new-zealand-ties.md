Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse has announced a new three year multiple-entry visa to make it easier for Turkish business people and diplomats to visit New Zealand.

Mr Woodhouse made the announcement during a visit to Turkey, where he is meeting with his Australian and Turkish counterparts to discuss next year’s planned centenary events and attending the 99th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

“New Zealand and Turkey have a special relationship through Gallipoli,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Both of our Governments have committed to building deeper ties as we look towards, and beyond, the centenary commemorations of Gallipoli next year.’’

Turkey is New Zealand’s 44th largest trade partner with bilateral trade valued at around $209 million a year.

Mr Woodhouse says the three year multiple-entry visa is designed to encourage more trade between the two countries, as well as facilitating travel to New Zealand for business and diplomatic visitors.

“New Zealand has a similar arrangement with China which has been extremely successful in strengthening business connections between China and New Zealand, and I’m confident that the agreement with Turkey will produce similar results.’’
