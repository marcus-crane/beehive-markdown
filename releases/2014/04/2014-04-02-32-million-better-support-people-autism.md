Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia have today announced the government is investing an extra $32 million over four years so more people with autism receive support to lead full lives.

“From today, World Autism Awareness day, everyone with autism spectrum disorder is now eligible to be assessed for support services, such as supported living, respite and carer support,” says Mr Ryall.

“2800 people with a sole diagnosis of autism currently receive support services funded by the Ministry of Health. This extra funding will see the number people receiving support increase by around 20 per cent to 3400,” says Mr Ryall.

“In the past, some people with autism but no other disability received support, while others did not. This change will mean people with autism will be treated the same across the country,” says Mrs Turia.

Mr Ryall said the range of services currently available to people with autism, so they can live everyday lives in the community, will also be increasing.

“This will make a real difference to people with autism, and their families,” said Mr Ryall.

The funding for support services for people with autism will increase from $40 million per year to $48 million – a 20 per cent increase.
