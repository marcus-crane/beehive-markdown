One hundred special passes from the Gallipoli ballot will be allocated to children of Gallipoli veterans and youth representatives, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse has announced. 

The special passes, which were held back from the first round of the ballot, will allow the recipients to attend Anzac Day commemorations in Gallipoli in 2015. Thirty-five double passes will be allocated to children of Gallipoli veterans, with another 30 single passes going to youth representatives and their chaperones.

“The Gallipoli campaign was a defining moment in New Zealand’s history and next year’s centenary commemorations will be particularly poignant,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Gallipoli continues to hold an important place in our hearts and that was made abundantly clear by the immense interest in the ballot.”

A total of 9851 applicants entered into the ballot, with 950 double passes available. Of those awarded in the first round, 26 per cent were won by direct descendants of those who fought at Gallipoli, 16 per cent by veterans, and 58 per cent by general public.

The special passes for the children of Gallipoli veterans will be allocated in the order they are currently placed on the Gallipoli ballot wait list. As with all other successful ballot applicants they will be required to make and fund their own travel arrangements to Gallipoli.

“Those successful will be advised by telephone and mail in early May.’’

Mr Woodhouse said the youth representatives will be selected in a yet to be finalised competitive process.
