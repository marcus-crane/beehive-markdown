Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and the European Commissioner for Development Mr Andris Piebalgs depart tomorrow on a renewable energy mission to four Pacific states.

“New Zealand and the European Union work together closely in the Pacific and a focus for this cooperation is support for renewable energy,” says Mr McCully.

“Last year we co-hosted the Pacific Energy Summit and launched the European Union – New Zealand Energy Access Partnership to fund renewable energy projects in the Pacific.

“This mission is an opportunity to see the progress being made on renewable energy initiatives in Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Cook Islands, and to meet with the Pacific governments and organisations to discuss opportunities for further cooperation.

“Representatives from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Renewable Energy Agency, are also joining the mission to gain further insight into the potential for sustainable energy across the Pacific.

“Renewable energy is a strong focus of our support to developing countries and we are committed to working with partners like the European Union to deliver clean, safe and reliable energy projects,” Mr McCully says.

The joint Mission departs for Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Cook Islands on 23 April and returns to New Zealand on 27 April.
