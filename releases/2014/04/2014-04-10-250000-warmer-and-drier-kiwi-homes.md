Two hundred and fifty thousand New Zealand homes have now been insulated under two Government programmes set up to make homes warmer and healthier.

Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says the Government’s insulation programmes have reduced the health risks and improved the comfort of many Kiwi households.

*Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* started in 2009 and the number of insulated homes reached over 238,000 at the end of March.  An additional 12,000 houses have been insulated as part of the new targeted *Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes* programme, which started late last year.

“This is a great result, which has exceeded all original targets set back in 2009,” Mr Bridges says. 

“Warmer, drier homes reduce health risks from conditions such as asthma and other respiratory disease, caused by living in cold, damp housing.

“Last year’s May budget allocated $100 million over three years to *Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes*, which is targeted at those most in need, especially where there are children and elderly people living in the home.

“The programme, run by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) working with community funders, offers free insulation for 46,000 homes across the country over three years. 

“Third party funding from organisations in local communities, as well as support from the health and social sectors, has been very important in contributing to the success of the programme, and I thank those groups for their continuing support,” Mr Bridges says.
