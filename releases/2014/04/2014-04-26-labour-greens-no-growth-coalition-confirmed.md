The departure of prominent Labour MP Shane Jones this week confirms that a Labour-Greens coalition stands for no growth and fewer jobs, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

Speaking at the National Party’s Lower North Island Regional Conference in Masterton this morning, Mr Joyce says Jones’ departure speaks volumes about the Labour-Greens policy prescription for New Zealand.

"Shane Jones has obviously realised that it is better to leave politics altogether than to stay for his best case scenario of being the Economic Development Minister in a government opposed to economic development. His comments this week have made that clear,” Mr Joyce says.

Mr Joyce says Jones' decision is backed up by the number of anti-growth positions taken by the Greens, and by large elements of the Labour Party.

"They are opposed to the dairy industry, growth in farming more generally, oil and gas exploration, aquaculture, free trade agreements, international investment, 90 day trials, faster resource management decisions, and tax policies that reward people for working hard and getting ahead," Mr Joyce says.

"They are in favour of more taxes on productive companies, higher costs, monopoly utilities, and no new development.

"There are a number of commentators who have tried to play down the significance of Jones' departure in economic policies, saying he is just one person and his role shouldn't be overstated.

"Well, the glee with which the Greens and the Labour Party left greeted his announcement tells another story.

“This is now the most left wing opposition New Zealand has seen in 40 years.

“The Greens and the loony left of the Labour Party are continuing to drive the Labour-Greens coalition further to the left into a no growth and fewer jobs cul-de-sac. Given half a chance that is where they would drive the country too.

"New Zealanders are only now starting to see the benefits of strong growth and sensible economic policies after five years of hard work battling the GFC, the Christchurch earthquakes, and the wasteful policies of the previous government. It would be hugely damaging for New Zealand to go back to the economic stagnation and paralysis that a Labour-Greens government would provide."
