State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman says there are fewer back office staff in the public service than in 2008.

“Under the previous Labour Government numbers in the core public service drastically escalated without any improvement in public services,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government introduced a cap on core government administration when we came into office and we lowered it again in 2011. We continue to remain below the cap we set of 36,475.

“We have made Better Public Services a priority, setting tough targets across ten important result areas. The Kiwis Count survey is an objective measure of how the public feels about 42 different public services they experience. It shows a measurable increase in public satisfaction and trust in public services over time.

“The bottom line is that this Government is delivering better public services at the same time as we’ve been shifting resources from the back office to the frontline – so more doctors, nurses and police officers, and fewer in core government administration.”
