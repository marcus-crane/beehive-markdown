The Government is investing $312,500 from the Major Events Development Fund to support the hosting of the 2017 Women’s Hockey World League Final in Auckland, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

The nine-day tournament, being run by Hockey New Zealand, is expected to attract the world’s top eight women’s hockey teams and their supporters bringing an economic benefit of around $1.2 million to the economy.

“New Zealand has a proven record in successfully staging world-class sporting events and hosting the final of the Women’s Hockey World League in 2017 will again demonstrate our ability to get in behind and stage a major international tournament,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand is one of the world’s leading hockey nations and this tournament will provide an opportunity to not only showcase New Zealand internationally but build the profile of the sport in New Zealand.”

Hockey New Zealand was informed by the International Hockey Federation on 14 March that New Zealand had won the right to host the 2017 Women’s World League Final. The tournament is to receive additional funding support from Auckland City Council and Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED).
