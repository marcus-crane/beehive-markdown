Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has celebrated Immunisation Week by attending an immunisation clinic at Starship Hospital this morning.

“The theme of this year’s Immunisation Week is *on time, every time*.  If your child is late for their immunisations, they can catch up, and clinics like this one make it easier,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The pop up clinic is running alongside Starship’s Outpatients Clinic during Immunisation Week. Children attending the clinic for other reasons, who are not up to date, are offered the immunisations while they wait. Families accompanying the children can also get immunised against influenza, measles and other preventable diseases.

“Being late for their scheduled immunisations puts children at risk of catching measles, whooping cough and other serious diseases,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“There’s nothing to be gained in putting off immunisation, and plenty to lose, but finding the time and transportation can be a struggle for families. It’s great to see clinics like this one helping families to catch up.

“We need 95% of people to be immunised to prevent outbreaks of serious diseases, and we want 95% of eight month olds fully immunised by December 2014.

“We’re on track to reach that target, but we’re not quite there yet. Immunisation protects you, your family and the wider public.”

Immunisation Week is celebrated worldwide in late April, and is coordinated by the World Health Organization. In New Zealand, DHBs around the country are organising clinics, community events and displays to promote immunisation.
