Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand will contribute up to $7 million towards the upgrade of Gordon’s Market in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.  

“Gordon’s Market is the largest produce market in the Pacific and it is a vital part of the fresh produce supply chain in PNG,” Mr McCully says.

“Currently the market has a number of issues around a lack of facilities, poor drainage, unreliable water supply, and security which are limiting returns to stall holders and producers. 

“New Zealand’s funding will contribute to civil infrastructure works, a new drainage system, new retail market facilities and a dedicated wholesale site.

“The redevelopment of Gordon’s Market sits within New Zealand’s overall support for agricultural development in PNG. At the moment PNG imports a large amount fresh produce and we are looking at all the points along the supply chain to increase the local share of that market.

“New Zealand is also working with leading agricultural distributors in PNG to develop and manage a system of cold storage facilities and improve the transport of fresh produce. 

“The redevelopment of Gordon’s Market is an important part of this strategy - which will give famers more confidence to expand their operations and encourage more consumers to choose locally grown produce,” Mr McCully says.
