Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today announced the appointment of David Plunkett as a member of the Accident Compensation Appeal Authority.  The appointment is for a three year term.

The Authority hears appeals against Accident Compensation Corporation decisions and reviews decisions that were made under the 1972 or 1982 Accident Compensation Acts.  Generally, the appeals and reviews considered by the Authority relate to injuries that occurred before 1 July 1992.

“David Plunkett brings considerable experience with tribunals, and a proven record of delivering sound, defensible and timely judgements,” said Mr Borrows.

“I’m very pleased that he has agreed to take on this role, in addition to his work as Chair of the Legal Aid Tribunal.”

He has previously held appointments to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal, Deportation Review Tribunal, Residence Review Board, Removal Review Authority and Refugee Status Appeals Authority. 

A replacement member of the Authority is required following the resignation of Ms Robyn Bedford.  

In announcing Mr Plunkett’s appointment the Associate Minister acknowledged the commitment Ms Bedford has given to the work of the Authority since her appointment in November 2011.
