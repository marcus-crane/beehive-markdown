Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has today welcomed the release of the revised and retitled brochure, *No car? No problem! Getting around your community without a car.*

“People stop driving for a variety of reasons. Adjusting to life without a car doesn’t mean losing your independence and freedom,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The key is to plan for your future transport needs now, so stopping driving isn’t a big problem later. Ensuring that people are informed about their transport options keeps them connected to their communities, family, and friends.”

Different solutions suit different people, depending on their circumstances and needs. Some possible solutions include:

- getting lifts from family or friends
- using taxis
- walking more often
- using a mobility scooter
- keeping your car, to make it easier for others to give you lifts

“In some areas of New Zealand, there are also transport options available through the SuperGold Card,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The brochure has been produced by the Office for Senior Citizens and the New Zealand Transport Agency, in consultation with the Volunteer Community Coordinators.

The brochure is available from the Office for Senior Citizens, or it can be downloaded from the Ministry of Social Development website.
