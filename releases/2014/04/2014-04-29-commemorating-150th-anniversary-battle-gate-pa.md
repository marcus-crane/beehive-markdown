Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman is joining local Iwi to commemorate the battle of Gate Pa - Pukehinahina.

“It is important that we remember and honour those who served during the New Zealand Wars, and today marks the 150th anniversary of the battle of Gate Pa,” says Dr Coleman.

“Gate Pa was a significant victory for the heavily outnumbered Māori forces. It was one of the heaviest British defeats of the New Zealand Wars. One hundred and eleven colonial troops were either killed or wounded. The number of Māori warriors killed was estimated at twenty.

“We come together today to pay tribute to those who lost their lives 150 years ago, and to reflect on how the New Zealand Wars helped to shape New Zealand as a nation.”

Attendees at today’s ceremony include the Māori King, Te Arikinui Tuheitia Kiingi Paki, the Governor-General, Lieutenant General The Right Honourable Sir Jerry Mateparae, Minister of Māori Affairs Pita Sharples, and Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant General Tim Keating.

Today’s commemorations are the third major event in a series of commemorations to mark the 150th anniversary of the Waikato Wars.
