Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the launch of the ‘new look’ customer driven CommunityNet Aotearoa website.

“CommunityNet Aotearoa draws together the huge variety of resources available to this sector to better support groups,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This new website has been tailor-made in response to customer feedback on the previous site.

“Users can now create a customised toolkit of the resources they want to use regularly or see as having value.  Additionally they can also share their own resources, including video, audio and pictures. Users are able to interact with the site by giving the thumbs-up to resources they find useful and ‘like’. They can also follow contributors to keep up-to-date with their resources and initiatives.

“About a third of all New Zealanders get involved in their communities through volunteering for an organisation, providing millions of volunteer hours a year and making a significant economic contribution.

“These people are the backbone of our sports and social groups, and the arts and cultural sector. It is important that they have access to the support and resources they need to do this essential work.

“This investment of time, effort and energy not only helps our country to function, but also contributes to the strength and resilience of our communities, making them better places for us to live,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The new CommunityNet website is managed by the Department of Internal Affairs and uses Government Web Standards. The new site can be found at [www.community.net.nz](http://www.community.net.nz).
