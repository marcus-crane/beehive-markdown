Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has congratulated the Department of Conservation, CQ Hotels Wellington and The Warehouse on winning the three top “Good Business Egg” awards at the Business and Community Share (BACS) Awards last evening in Auckland.

Speaking at the event Mrs Goodhew said BACS had established itself as an innovative element in the fabric of New Zealand life.

“I am sure that the significance of the acronym BACS isn’t lost on any of us – business backs the community with its skills, and the community backs business with its accumulated wisdom. In providing this online hub, BACS enlarges the vision and increases the capacity of different elements of our community to work together and benefit from the experience.”

Mrs Goodhew said the fact that 79 organisations were on the long list for the awards was very impressive.

“Collectively they have closely engaged with a very significant number of people in communities across New Zealand to share their skills.

“These awards are an excellent opportunity to acknowledge businesses that are doing a great job partnering with community organisations,” said Mrs Goodhew

“CQ Hotels won the health award for their work in contributing to community health in the Wellington region, connecting with local organisations to work with disabled peoples”.

“The Department of Conservation won the education award for their outstanding work in educating New Zealanders through the environment.

“And The Warehouse won the community empowerment award due to their commitment to major social issues in New Zealand.”
