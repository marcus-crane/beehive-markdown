People in Wellington, Porirua and the Kapiti Coast will benefit from a new online system enabling doctors in emergency departments and after hours practices to view a summary of patients’ recent GP records.

Health Minister Tony Ryall today visited Wellington Hospital’s emergency department today to launch the system, called the Shared Care Record.

“The system will give doctors and nurses much better information when they are deciding how to treat patients, such as what medications patients are currently on and any recent tests they have had,” said Mr Ryall.

“Patients won’t have to repeat information as often, and can avoid having to undergo duplicate tests such as x-rays and blood tests.

“The Shared Care Record will save time, save money, reduce waiting times and make a real difference to the quality and safety of our health system. Another benefit is patients won’t need to remember every detail of the medications their GP has prescribed.

“Authorised clinicians in hospital emergency departments and after hours practices will be able to quickly and easily click on a link in a patient’s onscreen record to view the summary of GP records.

“Information will be kept safe and confidential, and patients can choose to have part or all of their information withheld. We encourage patients to discuss this with their GP.

“Some of this information already exists in paper-based systems but is not always available when most needed. Having a summary of GP records available online will be a great benefit to patients and to the health professionals treating them,” said Mr Ryall.

The provider portal has been in use at Wairarapa District Health Board since 2011, and has now been widened to include Capital & Coast District Health Board and MidCentral District Health Boards.
