New Zealand is on track to phase out bulk imports of ozone-depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by the end of this year, Environment Minister Amy Adams says.

“HCFCs are the last controlled ozone-depleting substance for New Zealand to phase out under the Montreal Protocol, and New Zealand is well ahead of the 2030 international deadline to phase out imports,” Ms Adams says.

“The 2012 Annual Report on the Operation of the Ozone Layer Protection Act tabled in Parliament today confirms New Zealand is meeting its international obligations.”

Atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting substances have been declining since the late 1990s, which has protected human health and the environment.

“The ozone layer is now on track to full recovery within this century, thanks to effective global action to reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances in everyday products such as air conditioners, refrigerators, foams and pesticides.”

The Montreal Protocol is the global agreement to phase out the production and use of substances that have been depleting the ozone layer.

“New Zealand is proud of its role at the forefront of action to phase out ozone-depleting substances. We were one of the countries pushing for a strong agreement on this issue, and we signed the Montreal Protocol on the first day it opened for signature on 16 September 1987.”

The use of methyl bromide in New Zealand to fumigate soil for crops ended in 2007. Methyl bromide continues to be used in New Zealand where it is essential to meet the requirements of export countries and to protect our borders. 

The Government is supporting research into alternatives to methyl bromide and ways to minimise its use.
