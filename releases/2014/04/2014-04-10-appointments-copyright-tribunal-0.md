Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced the appointment of Sarah-Jane Weir to the Copyright Tribunal for a term of three years.

“The breadth of Ms Weir’s expertise in a range of areas, particularly technology and telecommunications will make her an asset to the Tribunal,” says Mr Foss.

Ms Weir will join Professor Susy Frankel (chairperson), Paul Sumpter, Peter Dengate-Thrush, Jane Glover and Sarah Bacon as the current Tribunal members.

The Governor-General has also reappointed Professor Susy Frankel as chairperson and Paul Sumpter as a member for another term.

The Minister also thanked Associate Judge Warwick Smith, who recently resigned from the Tribunal. Associate Judge Warwick Smith was appointed to the High Court in January. In his place the Governor-General has appointed Peter Dengate Thrush as deputy to the chairperson for the ongoing licensing dispute between Copyright Licensing New Zealand and New Zealand Universities.

Previously a partner at Anderson Lloyd and now a consultant, she is also a director of Nelmac Limited, a Nelson City Council controlled organisation, and Network Tasman Limited, an electricity lines company, and is chairperson of Fresh FM, a community access radio station.

**Background on the Copyright Tribunal**

The [Copyright Tribunal](http://www.courts.govt.nz/tribunals/index.html#c2) is a statutory body established under the Copyright Act 1994.  The Tribunal hears disputes between licensing bodies, or proposed licensing bodies, and those who hold or seek licenses in respect of works of copyright.  The Tribunal also hears disputes under the file sharing regime established by the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act 2011.

The Tribunal consists of a Chair and five members, who are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce.
