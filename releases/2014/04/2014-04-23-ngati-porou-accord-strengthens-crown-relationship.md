The Crown has signed an Accord with Ngāti Porou in Gisborne, formalising the government’s ongoing commitment to the iwi, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson said today.

The Crown-Ngāti Porou Relationship Accord is part of the Crown’s comprehensive Treaty settlement with the East Coast iwi, enacted in 2012.

Mr Finlayson said the purpose of the Accord was to improve outcomes from government investment for Ngāti Porou and develop and strengthen relationships with the iwi.

“The Crown-Ngāti Porou Relationship Accord affirms the Crown’s commitment to greater collaboration with Ngāti Porou. We will work with iwi to identify projects with the greatest impact for the largest number of people.

“The relationship between the Crown and Ngāti Porou is strong and enduring. This Accord will create further opportunities for us to work together for the benefit of Ngāti Porou,” the Minister said.

The Accord establishes an annual summit where Ministers will meet with representatives of iwi to monitor the progress of the Accord.

It also includes a portfolio agreement targeting erosion control for the Waiapu River catchment. Other portfolio agreements focusing on areas of significance identified by Ngāti Porou and the Crown will follow.

“Waiapu is central to Ngāti Porou’s identity and of great spiritual, cultural and economic significance. Restoring the river and preventing further damage through erosion is an important joint project involving the Ministry for Primary Industries, Ngāti Porou and Gisborne District Council,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Waiapu Restoration Programme Memorandum of Understanding was also signed at the ceremony today.
