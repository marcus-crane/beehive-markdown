Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will provide $1.5 million towards a project aimed at re-establishing and strengthening Fiji’s parliament.

“New Zealand is strongly supportive of Fiji’s moves to hold free and fair elections in September,” Mr McCully says.

“We also recognise that some of the institutions needed to underpin the return to democratic rule will require support during the transition and there is not much point holding elections if Parliament is unable to function effectively.

“We will be providing $1.5 million to a project led by the United Nations Development Programme aimed at re-establishing the Fiji Parliament.

“This two stage project will focus on practical support for items like IT and Hansard equipment, and building capacity amongst new MPs and parliamentary staff.

“New Zealand is pleased with the progress Fiji is making to towards holding elections and also mindful of the heavy lifting which needs to take place between now and September.

“We will continue to work with Fiji to help them prepare for elections and ensure they have the institutions in place to support the transition to democracy,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully is currently in to Fiji meet with Fiji’s Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola and other senior Ministers.
