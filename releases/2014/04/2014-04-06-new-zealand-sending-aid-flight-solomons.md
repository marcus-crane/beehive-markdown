Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced further support for the response to severe flooding in Solomon Islands.

“Our thoughts are with the people of Solomon Islands as they come to terms with the loss of life and damage caused by the flooding,” Mr McCully says.

“There are now 21 confirmed deaths and significant numbers of displaced persons in evacuation centres across Honiara.

“A RNZAF C-130 Hercules will depart from New Zealand tomorrow morning carrying relief supplies, and emergency response staff from New Zealand government agencies and non-government organisations.

“New Zealand Police on deployment as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Island (RAMSI) are already assisting with the response in Honiara.

“New Zealand’s initial $300, 000 in emergency funding has been provided to World Vision and Oxfam who are distributing essential supplies.

“We will continue to work with the authorities in Solomon Islands and further support will be considered as the full extent of the damage becomes clear,” Mr McCully said.
