Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated Police Commissioner Peter Marshall on his long and distinguished career serving the New Zealand public, as he prepares to retire from the service.

“Peter Marshall has led by example at home and overseas since joining the New Zealand Police in 1972,” says Mrs Tolley.

“He has been an extremely successful Commissioner, with crime falling in each of his three years at the helm.

“As well as delivering great results and helping make our communities safer, Commissioner Marshall has also enjoyed the respect of staff and frontline officers across the country. He did so during a time of significant operational change, as Police worked smarter and better to prevent crime.

“Peter leaves the New Zealand Police in very good shape and I wish him well for the future.”

Deputy Commissioner Mike Bush takes over the role of Commissioner from midnight tonight.
