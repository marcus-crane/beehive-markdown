Prime Minister John Key today expressed his condolences to the family of Sir Owen Woodhouse, ONZ KBE DSC. Sir Owen passed away aged 97.

“Sir Owen Woodhouse was a man whose life exemplified public service and duty to his country,” Mr Key said.

“He was a decorated naval officer in World War II, receiving a Distinguished Service Cross for operations in the Adriatic, before embarking on a long and distinguished career as a jurist at the highest level.”

“He is best known for chairing the Royal Commission on Accident Compensation, authoring the Woodhouse Report, which recommended a no-fault accident compensation scheme for New Zealand. He leaves a genuinely important legacy.”

Sir Owen was made an Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand in 2007, after being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1981.

Sir Owen Woodhouse was President of the Court of Appeal between 1981 and 1986, and was made a Privy Counsellor and member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1974.
