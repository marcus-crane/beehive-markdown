Justice Minister Judith Collins says the latest Justice sector Better Public Services results for reducing crime and re-offending, are the best quarterly results since the targets were set.

The Better Public Services (BPS) targets set a goal of a 15 per cent reduction in total crime by June 2017, compared to baseline figures from June 2011.

“It’s fantastic news that our latest Justice sector BPS results show the total crime rate has reduced by 14 per cent between June 2011 and December 2013,” says Ms Collins.

“The latest results for this period also show the youth crime rate has dropped by 27 per cent, violent crime is down 10 per cent and overall re-offending is down by 11.7 per cent.

  

“New Zealand now has the lowest crime rate since 1978 but most importantly, the results mean New Zealanders are experiencing around 56,000 fewer crimes a year, leading to fewer victims of crime.

“The BPS youth crime target has now been exceeded for a second time. We have almost met our total crime target and we’re halfway to meeting both the violent crime and re-offending targets – with more than three years to go.

“With steady progress being made on these broader targets, the Justice sector is working hard on getting to the heart of crimes that cause significant and life changing harm, such as sexual violence and domestic violence. 

“We are ensuring our Justice sector resources are focused where they are most needed, to achieve enduring results for our most vulnerable people,” Ms Collins says.

Ms Collins has indicated that the BPS crime reduction and re-offending targets would be reviewed later in the year.
