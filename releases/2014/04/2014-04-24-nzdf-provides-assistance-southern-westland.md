Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the NZDF is providing assistance to the community of Whataroa in Southern Westland in the wake of the recent significant storm damage.

“I asked the NZDF to provide appropriate assistance to Whataroa to help with the extensive clean-up following the recent storm,” says Dr Coleman.

“Nine NZDF personnel are currently on the ground in Whataroa working with the local council to assess what needs to be done. A team of 16 engineers and support personnel from 1 NZ Brigade based in Burnham will arrive in Whataroa this afternoon to help the local community.

“Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Local MP Chris Auchinvole alerted me to the extensive devastation that the storm has caused in the Southern Westland region. Forestry has been flattened and there is a huge amount of clearing up to do. It is a major job.”

Nathan Guy and Chris Auchinvole will continue to monitor the situation closely and liaise with people on the ground.
