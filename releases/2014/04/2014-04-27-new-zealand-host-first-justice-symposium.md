Justice Minister Judith Collins has today announced justice sector experts will converge on Wellington this Tuesday for New Zealand’s first Leading Justice Symposium.

“This Symposium will bring high-calibre experts together to discuss and share valuable insights on justice issues and how to address the changing nature of crime,” Ms Collins says.

International guests and panellists at the Symposium will include:

- Hon Michael Mischin MLC, Attorney-General, Western Australia
- Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong Thye, Singapore
- District Judge Victor Yeo, Singapore
- Mr Rick Persse, Chief Executive, Attorney-General’s Department, South Australia
- Mr Greg Wilson, Secretary of the Department of Justice, Victoria
- Professor Gloria Laycock OBE, an expert advisor on policing and crime prevention, who is Professor of Crime Science at University College London;
- Dr Russell G Smith, Principal Criminologist for the Australian Institute of Criminology, who is a recognised expert on cyber-crime, organised crime and transnational crime;
- Professor Betsy Stanko, Head, Evidence and Insight, Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime in London.

Ms Collins has asked the Symposium to take a ten-year horizon approach and provide the Government with fresh thinking around reducing crime and victimisation.

“New Zealand has made very good progress in reducing crime, and beginning the modernisation of our courts system, but to reinforce that trajectory we need to understand the changing nature of crime,” Ms Collins says.

“The digital age has given rise to new issues such as cyber-bullying, identity theft, hacking, and online stalking – concepts which were unheard of a generation ago.  Our justice system must adapt as the face of these sorts of behaviours and crime continues to evolve.

“The Symposium will address these global and domestic trends, the most effective ways of supporting victims, and the likely shape of New Zealand crime and the justice sector in 2024. 

“I’m sure the perspectives of the panellists and participants will enable us to test new ideas in each of these areas and add valuable insight to the crime discussion.

Ms Collins is also looking forward to a number of bilateral meetings in the lead up to the Symposium, including one with Western Australian Attorney-General, Hon Michael Mischin.

The Leading Justice Symposium will be held on Tuesday 29 April at Parliament.
