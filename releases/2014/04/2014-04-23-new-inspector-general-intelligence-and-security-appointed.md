Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Cheryl Gwyn as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

The appointment was made by the Administrator of the Government on behalf of the Governor General and is for a term of three years.

“Ms Gwyn will start in her new role on the 5th of May, taking over from the outgoing Inspector-General, the Honourable R Andrew McGechan CNZM QC,” Mr Key says.

Ms Gwyn is currently Deputy Solicitor-General at Crown Law, and has previously been a partner at two law firms. She has also been a Deputy Secretary for Justice as well as Acting Solicitor General and Chief Executive at Crown Law.

The appointment of Ms Gwyn was made after consultation with Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, as is required by statute.

“I would like to thank Hon McGechan for agreeing to fulfil the role of Inspector-General since the middle of last year, at a time of significant change and scrutiny of the intelligence community,” says Mr Key.

The role of the Inspector-General has increased significantly following the passing of legislation last year. The changes include an extended work programme for the Office as well as greater resourcing.
