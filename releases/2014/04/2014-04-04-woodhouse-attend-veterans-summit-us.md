Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to the United States next week to attend an international summit aimed at improving the lives of war veterans and their families.

The Ministerial Summit on Veterans’ Affairs will take place at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York from 6 April to 8 April.

Mr Woodhouse will meet with Ministers and other representatives from the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom to address veterans’ issues facing their respective countries.

“I look forward to this opportunity to discuss how we can best support our veterans and their families as we approach the centenary of World War One,’’ Mr Woodhouse says.

Following the conclusion of the summit, Mr Woodhouse will travel to Washington DC to visit the Immigration New Zealand office, the U.S Department of Veteran Affairs and the Walter Reed National Military Centre.

Mr Woodhouse will depart New Zealand for the United States on 5 April.
