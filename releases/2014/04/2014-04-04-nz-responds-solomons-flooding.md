Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced an initial contribution of  $300,000 to support the immediate response to severe flooding in Solomon Islands.

“Heavy rain has caused flash flooding in Honiara and reports are coming in of flooding in other parts of Solomon Islands,” Mr McCully said.

“The death toll is likely to rise and there appears to be significant damage to homes and infrastructure.

“New Zealand will provide $250,000 to agencies working on the ground in Solomon Islands to help provide emergency relief supplies and shelter to those affected by the flooding.

“A further $50,000 in emergency funding has been released to our High Commission to help address areas of immediate need identified by the Solomon Islands Government.

“We are in close contact with the local authorities in Honiara and stand ready to provide further assistance as required,” Mr McCully said.
