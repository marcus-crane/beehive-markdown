Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon Peter Dunne was saddened to learn today the passing of Beverley Grammer, Presiding Member of the Lottery Individuals with Disabilities Committee.

"Over the past 13 years Beverley has served both as a committee member, and more recently as Presiding Member, of a committee which is focused on improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities”, says Mr Dunne.

“Beverley worked alongside other Presiding Members to ensure that issues affecting community groups and the disability community were understood, and that funding of the Lottery Grants Board continued to be focused on those areas which most need additional support."

An active member in her community, Beverley held a number of leadership positions, including as Managing Director of UP2DATE Consultancy Services.

"I would like to express my condolences to Beverley's family and friends, and to recognise the legacy that she leaves through her strong advocacy for the disability sector”, says Mr Dunne.
