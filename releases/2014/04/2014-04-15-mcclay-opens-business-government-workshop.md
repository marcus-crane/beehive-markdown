Revenue Minister Todd McClay has opened the Business to Government Collaboration Workshop in Wellington today, citing it as a great opportunity for Government and private enterprise to find new ways to improve and simplify digital services.

The Business to Government Collaboration Workshop is being hosted by Inland Revenue, Xero, Westpac and MBIE, and brings chief executives and ICT managers from across the public sector together with leaders from the business and ICT communities.

“The workshop will discuss ways that digital platforms can be made easier and support the Government’s commitment to delivering Better Public Services for New Zealanders,” says Mr McClay.

“New Zealanders want accuracy, certainty, and efficiency in their dealings with Government.” 

“They expect to be able to interact with Government as easily as with any other business, 24 hours and seven days a week.”

“As well as changing customer expectations, technology is constantly on the move. Mobile services are becoming faster and easier to use, while more people have access to tablets and smart-phones, allowing them to better self-manage their affairs online.”

“If Government and businesses are to meet these challenges then we need to work together and share ideas.” 

“The App4IR Challenge that closes this week is a good example. Inland Revenue has gone to the market with this competition because we want to tap into the creativity and innovation of our ICT community.”

“Positive improvements to the services provided by government inevitably come from interaction with the private sector and also understanding what our customers really want.”

“Our challenge is that New Zealanders deserve to be provided with the best possible digital services, and they want them delivered cheaper and better.”

“This Government has accepted that challenge,” says Mr McClay.
