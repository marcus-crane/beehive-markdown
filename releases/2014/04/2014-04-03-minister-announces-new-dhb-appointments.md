Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced new appointments to two District Health Boards.

Bay of Plenty Chair Sally Webb has been appointed as Deputy Chair of Taranaki District Health Board.

“Ms Webb has been Chair of Bay of Plenty DHB since 2010. She has experience as a member of the Minister of Health’s Ministerial Reference Group in 2009, and as a director and interim Chief Executive Office of the Health Funding Authority,” says Mr Ryall.

“Cross appointments to DHB Boards are now common and reflect greater regional collaboration in the planning and delivery of health services,’ says Mr Ryall.

Mr Michael Boorer JP has been appointed as a member of the South Canterbury District Health Board.

“Mr Boorer is currently Corporate Services Manager at Alpine Energy Ltd. He worked for the Order of St John for 12 years until 2012, including four years as Finance and Administration Director,” says Mr Ryall.
