Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman will meet with Admiral Samuel Locklear Commander of US Pacific Command on Monday.

“I am looking forward to meeting with Admiral Locklear to discuss our bilateral defence relationship and key security issues facing the Asia-Pacific region. The US Pacific Command is a major contributor to defence and security within our region,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand’s defence relationship with the US is in great shape. We have steadily increased our engagement and joint activities since the signing of the Washington Declaration in 2012.

“The NZDF is looking forward to participating in RIMPAC, the world’s largest maritime exercise in Hawaii later this year, and Exercise Pacific Partnership, the annual humanitarian assistance mission in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Admiral Locklear is visiting New Zealand for the first time as part of a wider visit to the region.
