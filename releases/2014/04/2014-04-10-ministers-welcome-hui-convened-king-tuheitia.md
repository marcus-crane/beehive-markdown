Education Minister Hekia Parata and Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples have acknowledged the leadership of King Tuheitia and welcomed this weekend’s hui to discuss governance of the Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust.

Ms Parata says there has been a loss of public and Government confidence in the Trust Board and it needs to address concerns about its governance.

“We have advised the Board that the Government requires it to have governance that is fully accountable, transparent and democratically representative.

“The Government has a strong interest in kōhanga reo and the provision of services to support early learning and development in the Māori language. The Ministry has reassured kohanga centres of the business as usual approach to funding and support for their services,” says Ms Parata.

Dr Sharples says the leadership role taken by King Tuheita to help effect change and resolution of the issues is greatly appreciated.

“We also want to thank King Tuheitia for welcoming observers from the Ministry of Education and Te Puni Kōkiri at the hui. They will be there simply to listen.”

Ms Parata and Dr Sharples say they look forward to hearing back from the Board following the hui about what actions it has agreed on.
