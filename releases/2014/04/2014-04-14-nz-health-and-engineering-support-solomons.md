Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced New Zealand will send health personnel and a Bailey bridge to Solomon Islands to assist with the response to flooding.

“The main hospital in Honiara is stretched after the recent flooding and there is a very serious risk of waterborne disease spreading around the capital,” Mr McCully says.

“We will be deploying two New Zealand health teams, on separate rotations, to assist the local authorities. The teams will consist of up to ten people, including; emergency management doctors and nurses, logisticians and support staff.

“We have also agreed to provide a portable Bailey bridge to the Solomon Islands government to help maintain the critical link between the airport and Honiara’s city centre.

“The Mataniko Bridge was damaged in the initial flooding and the Bailey bridge from the New Zealand Transport Agency will help ensure transport links are maintained while it is repaired,” Mr McCully said.

The first health team will leave for Honiara on Tuesday and the Bailey bridge components are expected to be shipped in the coming weeks. This latest announcement will take New Zealand’s total contribution to relief and recovery efforts in Solomon Islands to around $2.6 million since the flooding hit.
