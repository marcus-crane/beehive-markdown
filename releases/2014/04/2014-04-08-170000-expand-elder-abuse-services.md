Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced an additional $170,000 for two new specialist Elder Abuse and Neglect Prevention (EANP) services, one in Wairoa and one in Rotorua which will also cover Kawerau.

“Raising awareness of elder abuse and neglect is one of my top priorities as the Minister for Senior Citizens. As a Government, we want an environment where older people can live life as healthy, independent, connected and respected members of our communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Government already funds 24 EANP services around New Zealand, costing $1.6 million per year.

“The Ministry of Social Development has worked closely with Age Concern New Zealand to better understand the demand for EANP services across the country, and identify the areas with unmet service needs,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Wairoa, Kawerau and Rotorua were identified as areas of high need which currently have no funded services. The Ministry of Social Development will be contacting potential providers shortly.”

Mrs Goodhew has acknowledged the major role Age Concern plays in the prevention and treatment for elder abuse and neglect.

“Age Concern New Zealand’s contribution is monumental – they are currently funded to deliver 19 of the country’s 24 EANP services. They also provide training and coordination for all 24 services.

“I would like to express my gratitude for the work that Age Concern does in supporting older New Zealanders to live safe, healthy lives as active and valued members of our communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Further information on EANP services can be found on the Ministry of Social Development’s website or by calling the Family Violence Information Line on 0800 456 450.
