Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says Anzac Day will be especially poignant this year with the start of WWI centenary commemorations.

“Tomorrow marks the 99th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, and New Zealanders at home and overseas will come together to honour those who gave their lives whilst serving their country in past and recent times,” says Dr Coleman.

“On Anzac Day we remember the bravery and determination of the soldiers who fought at Gallipoli. Their strength in adversity remains an ongoing source of pride for New Zealanders and Australians.

“Anzac Day is about the values that are important to New Zealanders. The qualities of the original ANZACs – courage, endurance, loyalty and service - remain alive and well in the NZDF today. New Zealand greatly values and appreciates the contribution that our NZDF personnel continue to make at home and overseas.”

Dr Coleman will be attending the dawn service at the NZSAS base at Papakura Military Camp, and Anzac Day services in Birkenhead, Northcote and Glenfield.

On Anzac Day NZDF personnel will be represented at local commemorations throughout New Zealand as well as a number of locations overseas.

There are currently 252 NZDF personnel deployed on operations, United Nations missions, defence exercises and overseas commitments around the world.
