Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says the first batch of new Medium-Heavy Operational Vehicles have been delivered to NZDF units.

“It is great to see these vehicles being used by the NZDF just 12 months on from when they were purchased,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government achieved a fast delivery and ensured value for money by purchasing these trucks off the same production line as the UK. This project is a great example of smart and efficient procurement, and we are keen to identify future procurement opportunities which could achieve similar results.

“The new Rheinmetall-MAN military medium and heavy vehicles are a significant step up in capability for the NZDF, replacing the old Unimog and Mercedes trucks. They are designed for modern military operations and offer better mobility, better protection, enhanced technology, and greater capacity.

“The new trucks are part of a wider programme of equipment upgrades and investment into Navy, Army and Air Force frontline capabilities.”

2 Combat Service Support Battalion in Linton and 3 Combat Service Support Battalion in Burnham have both recently received seven trucks. A total of 93 new trucks have been delivered to the NZDF, and they will be rolled out to units later this year once personnel complete driver and maintenance training.

A total of 194 trucks are being delivered at a cost of $113 million. This includes armour protection kits, weapons mounts, a range of specialist equipment, spare parts, logistic support arrangements, and training packages.
