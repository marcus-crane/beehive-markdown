Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye is today asking New Zealanders to recognise outstanding young community members and nominate them for a Youth Week 2014 Award.

“I am creating these awards for this year’s Youth Week to recognise and celebrate young people aged 12-24 who have contributed to their community in a significant way,” Ms Kaye says.

“I know there are thousands of young people out there making valuable contributions in their communities both individually and as members of groups. I would like to encourage people to take the time to nominate those young people to be formally acknowledged for what they are doing.

“As Minister of Youth Affairs, I am always impressed to hear about the young people who undertake and often lead significant projects. Encouraging them to be active in their communities helps them to become confident and creative leaders.”

Young people can be nominated for one of four awards: the Leadership Award, Change Maker Award, Giving Back Award and Working for Young People Award.

“The awards will be judged by representatives of the Ministry of Youth Development’s Youth Advisory Group. It is important to me that these awards can be judged through the lens of young Kiwis. The group will be looking for the ability to motivate and engage others, leadership skills, commitment and perseverance,” Ms Kaye says.

Award winners will be announced during Youth Week 2014 which runs from 17 to 25 May.

Youth Week 2014 Award nominations open today and close at 9am on 28 April 2014. For further information on the Youth Week 2014 Awards or to nominate a young person go to [http://www.myd.govt.nz/news/2014/youth-week-2014.html](http://www.myd.govt.nz/news/2014/youth-week-2014.html)
