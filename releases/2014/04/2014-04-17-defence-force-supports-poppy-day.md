Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman joined Defence Force personnel including the Vice Chief of Defence Force Air Vice-Marshal Kevin Short, to collect donations for the annual Poppy Day appeal in Wellington today.

“Poppy Day is one of New Zealand’s oldest nationwide appeals, and it is great to see New Zealanders give their support. These donations are vital to local Returned and Services’ Association’s so they can continue to help veterans, ex-service personnel, and their families,” says Dr Coleman.

“Wearing a poppy on Anzac Day is a way of paying tribute to the New Zealanders who made the ultimate sacrifice whilst serving their country. This year has even more significance with the start of WWI centenary commemorations.”

Hundreds of volunteers will be out on the streets throughout New Zealand today collecting donations. In Wellington, around 150 Defence Force personnel, two US Marines, and volunteers from Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand will be lending their support.

Over one million poppies are expected be distributed this year. Poppy Day is the biggest fundraising day for the RSA. With the start of WW1 centenary commemorations this year, the RSA is encouraging people to wear a poppy not just on Anzac Day but from Poppy Day onwards.
