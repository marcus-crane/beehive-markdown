The House sat extended hours this morning to pass the third reading of the Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū Claims Settlement Bill, which will give effect to the hapū’s historical Treaty settlement with the Crown. 

The Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū Claims Settlement Bill will settle the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of the Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū, comprising Ngāti Kurumokihi, Ngāti Tu, Ngāti Whakaari, Ngāi Tauira, Ngāi Te Ruruku ki Tangoio, and Ngāi Tahu Hapū. 

The Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū are based north of Napier in the Hawke’s Bay.

The settlement includes an agreed historical account, Crown acknowledgements and apology, the vesting, and vesting and giftback, of culturally significant sites; establishment of a fund for the purpose of soil conservation in the Tangoio area; a partnership agreement (Te Kawenata) with the Minister and Department of Conservation; and financial and commercial redress with a value of $23 million

“The impact of war and raupatu (confiscation) on the Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū, and the manner in which the Crown purchased most of the lands left to the hapū after the raupatu, are felt by the hapū  to this day,” Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson said. “Enacting this legislation allows the hapū of Maungaharuru-Tangitū to build a strong future for their people and begin a new relationship with the Crown.”

“The government is deeply committed to resolving historical Treaty grievances in a just and timely manner,” Mr Finlayson said.

The legislation was passed unanimously.
