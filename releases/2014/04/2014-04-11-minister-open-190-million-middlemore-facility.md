Health Minister Tony Ryall will this afternoon open a new $190 million clinical services block at Middlemore Hospital, named after eminent orthopaedic surgeon Dr Harley Gray.

“The Harley Gray Building is a state-of-the art facility that will help future-proof  services at Middlemore,” says Mr Ryall.

“The new building is five stories tall and the size of five rugby fields. It will help Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) deliver more efficient health services in a region of rapid population growth and high health need.

“The building uses the latest in hospital design approaches - the layout is welcoming and ensures easier access for patients and staff.

“Counties Manukau DHB now has a facility that matches the high standards of patient care provided by its dedicated staff,” says Mr Ryall.

Features of the Harley Gray Building, at the heart of the Middlemore site, include:

- 14 new operating theatres, replacing 11 older theatres
- a 38-cot neonatal care unit
- a 42-bed medical assessment unit
- a 23-bed post-anaesthetic care unit
- a 20-bed theatre admission and discharge unit
- a state-of-the-art central sterile supply department

There is also space to include laboratories and radiology services in the future.

The Harley Gray Building’s construction was part of a $209 million project at Counties Manukau DHB, and was supported by $100 million of government funding. 

Dr Gray, a former President of the New Zealand Orthopaedic Association and the Auckland Medico Legal Society, was an orthopaedic surgeon at Middlemore until 2001. He was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2003.

“Over the past five years, we have invested over $770 million into capital projects for district health boards. This includes the $53 million Lakeview extension at North Shore Hospital, the $27 million Greenlane elective surgery centre and the $41 million Whangarei Hospital redevelopment,” says Mr Ryall.
