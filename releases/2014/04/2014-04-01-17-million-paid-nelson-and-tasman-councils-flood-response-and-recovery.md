Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the Government will pay $1.46 million to Nelson City Council and $317,000 to Tasman District Council for civil defence emergency response and recovery costs arising from the flood event in the Nelson-Tasman region in December 2011.

“Each council has the responsibility for an initial civil defence response in its area, and then for recovery. I would like to acknowledge the important and significant work done by the Nelson and Tasman Councils and thank all the individuals involved,” Ms Kaye says.

“It is important for local authorities to know that central Government is here to support them in major events with direct financial assistance. The aim is to cover the response costs and support the community as it focuses on recovery. These funds mean that ratepayers do not have to meet the full costs of such an event.”

The payments are a contribution to the costs the councils incurred responding to the flooding on 14 December 2011, after Takaka experienced one-in-500 year rainfall and Richmond-Nelson region experienced one-in-250 year rainfall.

“The payments include a contribution to the on-going costs of restoring river management systems, which were severely damaged by the flooding,” Ms Kaye says.

The financial assistance for the response period pays for essential civil defence costs incurred in accommodating, transporting, feeding and clothing displaced people, and for repair of essential infrastructure, and other response costs.

Financial support for recovery contributes to repair or recovery of essential infrastructure assets, river management systems, and other community assets damaged following failure of flood protection schemes.
