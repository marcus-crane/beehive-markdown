Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide a further $1.2 million to help Solomon Islands following severe flooding.

“The additional funding will be used to provide relief supplies, and help restore health, water and sanitation systems. It is now clear that these are areas of critical need,” Mr McCully says.

“Funding will also be available to New Zealand non-government organisations to support on-going relief and early recovery efforts in Solomon Islands.

“Yesterday evening a RNZAF C-130 delivered relief supplies including tarpaulins, water containers, and medical supplies.  

“Disaster response specialists from New Zealand government agencies, non-government organisations, and the Red Cross were also aboard the flight and are now helping with relief efforts.

  

“New Zealand will consider a wider recovery package as Solomon Islands undertake longer term reconstruction efforts. It is clear the flooding caused significant damage in places to housing, power lines, roads and bridges.

“Solomon Islands face a major recovery effort and New Zealand stands ready to assist with this,” Mr McCully says.

Today’s announcement takes New Zealand’s total support to date to $1.5 million.
