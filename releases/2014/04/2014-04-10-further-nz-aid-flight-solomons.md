Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman have announced a second New Zealand Defence Force C-130 flight will be made to the Solomon Islands.

“Assessments on the ground have reinforced the need for a further C-130 flight to transport additional supplies to help support the relief effort after the severe flooding on Guadalcanal,” Mr McCully says.

“The C-130 will carry additional relief supplies and technical experts to assist with relief and recovery work being carried out by the Solomon Islands Government.”

Dr Coleman says the C-130 is scheduled to depart from Auckland on Friday morning for Honiara.

“This will be the second Defence Force flight to help the Solomon Islands.  New Zealand Aid Programme, Defence and health teams have also been on the ground undertaking damage assessments to shape what further support is required,” Dr Coleman says.

The New Zealand government’s financial contribution to the flood relief effort now totals approximately $1.6 million dollars.
