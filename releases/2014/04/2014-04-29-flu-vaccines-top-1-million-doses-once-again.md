2014 is New Zealand’s third year in a row in which over one million doses of seasonal flu vaccine have been distributed, says Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew. 

“With three months still to go for the 2014 seasonal influenza programme, I’m confident we can match last year’s total of 1.25 million doses.”

“This is a fantastic milestone to celebrate during World Immunisation Week.  DHBs, doctors, nurses and pharmacists have once again done a great job to help so many New Zealanders be protected against seasonal flu this year,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Although flu can be a moderate illness for most of us, for some people, it can lead to serious complications – even death.”

The flu vaccination is free to those at greatest risk of serious influenza complications, including New Zealanders over the age of 65 and people with ongoing health conditions such as asthma or heart problems, as well as pregnant women.

People who are not eligible for the free programme can purchase the vaccine from their general practitioner.
