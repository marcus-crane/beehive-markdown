Foreign Minister Murray McCully is in Fiji to meet with Fiji’s Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola.

This is the first visit to Fiji by a New Zealand Minister since the lifting of New Zealand’s remaining travel sanctions against Fiji. 

“Fiji is making good strides towards holding elections later this year and this has resulted in a positive shift in New Zealand’s relationship with Fiji,” Mr McCully says.

“There is still a great deal of work to do in Fiji around preparing for elections and supporting the institutions that will underpin a successful return to democratic rule.

“New Zealand wants to support this work and we are throwing our full weight behind Fiji’s return to democracy. I look forward to discussing how we further assist with the September elections during my visit,” says Mr McCully.

Minister McCully travelled to Fiji directly from Papua New Guinea.
