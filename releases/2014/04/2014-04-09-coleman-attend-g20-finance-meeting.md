Associate Minister of Finance Jonathan Coleman departs New Zealand today for Washington to attend this week’s G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting.

“This is an important opportunity to meet with finance ministers from the world’s largest economies to discuss key economic challenges, including strategies for growth and employment, and building a resilient global economy,” says Dr Coleman.

“Our focus on returning to surplus in 2014/15 whilst managing global and domestic risks is helping to sustain New Zealand’s performance as the fastest growing developed economy this year. The IMF confirmed recently that our macro-economic framework remains sound and our growth prospects continue to improve, and we have a good story to share.”

As host of the G20 this year, Australia invited New Zealand to attend as a guest alongside the G20 members. The Washington D.C. G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting takes place from 10-11 April 2014. The meeting will include sessions on the global economy and growth strategies, financial regulation, and investment.
