Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to Turkey next week to attend the 99th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

During his visit, Mr Woodhouse will meet with his Australian and Turkish counterparts to discuss next year’s planned centenary events.

“Anzac Day is an opportunity to honour and remember all those who have served in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations for New Zealand,’’ Mr Woodhouse says.

“As we mark nearly 100 years since the Gallipoli campaign, it will be privilege and an honour for me to be involved in this occasion.’’

Mr Woodhouse will depart New Zealand for Turkey on April 20.
