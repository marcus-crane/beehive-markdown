Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will continue to support Tuvalu’s conversion to renewable energy alongside the European Union.

“Currently 95 per cent of Tuvalu’s electricity comes from diesel generation – which is unsustainable financially,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand has funded the development of four small scale solar-hybrid systems on the Islands of Niutao, Nanumanga, Nanumea and Vaitupu.

“When completed, these systems will provide 90 per cent of the power needs on these islands and will help ensure there is a reliable and efficient electricity service.

“Today we have entered into a partnership with the European Union (EU), and Tuvalu to continue this work. Funding from the EU will develop three further mini-grid systems on the Islands of Nukulaelae, Nukufetau and Nui.

“This in an excellent example of New Zealand’s cooperation with the EU on renewable energy and the sort of practical projects we can deliver in partnership with Pacific countries,” Mr McCully says.

Mr McCully is in Tuvalu as part of a joint New Zealand and European Union renewable energy mission.
