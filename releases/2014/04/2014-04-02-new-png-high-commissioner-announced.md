Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that diplomat Tony Fautua will be New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea.

“Papau New Guinea and New Zealand are close partners in the Pacific,” Mr McCully said.

“New Zealand exports to PNG totalled more than $230 million in 2013, making it our largest trading partner in the Pacific.

“The rapid, transformative, economic growth occurring in PNG is creating major opportunities for New Zealand business and new commercial partnerships.

“Our aid programme in PNG is focused on working  together in areas such as renewable energy, agriculture, and community policing in Bougainville,” Mr McCully said.

Mr Fautua has strong experience in the Pacific.  He has had postings in Niue and as a special representative to Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, and was most recently Ambassador to Timor-Leste.
