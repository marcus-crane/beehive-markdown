Revenue Minister Todd McClay has described consultation with New Zealand’s ICT industry as critical to the success of IRD’s Business Transformation programme, which will bring the tax system into the 21st Century.

“I have initiated regular ministerial consultation meetings with senior representatives of each of the three major industry groups (IITP, NZRise and NZ Tech) to better engage with the sector and ensure that IRD utilises the full capabilities of New Zealand’s ICT industry,” says Mr McClay.

“The aim of these meetings is to discuss the importance of the New Zealand ICT industry within the Business Transformation programme and investigate ways that IRD can further support the sector.”

“Business Transformation is aimed at making tax compliance easier for New Zealanders and their businesses. It will modernise and simplify tax processes and allow taxpayers to seamlessly interact with IRD in a digital environment.”

“As we embark on this important transformation programme the government is keen to further develop New Zealand’s ICT sector in this highly technical field.”

Mr McClay says that there would be significant and ongoing opportunities for New Zealand ICT companies over the ten years of Business Transformation. Already local company Assurity Consulting Limited, has been chosen as preferred testing provider, a contract worth $30m.

Mr McClay also highlighted the current App4IR competition as another example of the opportunities for innovative New Zealanders to work alongside Inland Revenue.  

“The experience of New Zealand’s ICT professionals in efficiently meeting the needs of demanding clients will be invaluable in ensuring that Business Transformation is successful and our future tax system works for the benefit of New Zealanders and their businesses,” says Mr McClay.
