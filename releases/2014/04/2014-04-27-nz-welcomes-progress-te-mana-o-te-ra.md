Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today visited the site of the New Zealand funded Te Mana o te Ra solar array on Rarotonga.  

“When completed the Te Mana o te Ra solar array will generate 5 per cent of Rarotonga’s electricity needs - providing a significant boost to renewable energy in the Cook Islands,” says Mr McCully.  

“The contact for carrying out this work has been awarded to New Zealand company Infratec Renewables Ltd, with significant construction and electrical works being carried out by local Cook Islands sub-contractors.  

“New Zealand has invested $3.3 million in the Te Mana o te Ra project as part of the European Union and New Zealand Energy Access Partnership.  

“A $20.5 million contract is also now in place to deploy eight new solar-diesel powered mini-grid systems on six Northern Group Islands.  

“All are due to be commissioned this year, and they will ensure the islands of Rakahanga, Pukapuka, Nassau, Penrhyn, Manihiki  and Palmerston have a more sustainable and reliable source of electricity.  

“New Zealand is a strong supporter of renewable energy in the Pacific, and these projects are part of our commitment to support nations in the Pacific move towards a target of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2020,” Mr McCully says.
