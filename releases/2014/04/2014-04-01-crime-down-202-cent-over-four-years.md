Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated Police staff following the announcement that recorded crimes have fallen for the fourth year in a row, down a total of 20.2 per cent, to their lowest figure in 29 years.

“Fewer crimes means fewer victims and safer communities, and I want to thank our officers for everything they are doing to serve and protect the public,” says Mrs Tolley.

Offences dropped by 4.1 per cent in 2013, with 15,602 fewer recorded crimes compared to the year before, and 90,994 fewer offences in 2013 compared to 2009.

The crime rate, per head of population, saw a 5 per cent fall in 2013.

“The focus on visible frontline Policing and prevention, with the right tools for the job, is continuing to show great results and we are determined to keep this momentum going,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Police foot patrols increased by 155 per cent over the last two years, and officers are now equipped with smartphones and tablets which allow them to input and access important information without returning to the station.

“This is delivering an extra half a million frontline Police hours every year, or the equivalent of 354 additional officers.

“Crime fell in nine of the twelve Police districts in 2013, with the biggest drops of 9.9 per cent seen in Auckland and Wellington. It is also worthy of note that offences in Canterbury fell by 5.6 per cent. There were small rises in Eastern, Central and Northland.

“The number of serious assaults, public place assaults and public order offences continue to fall, as do the figures for robbery and theft from cars.

“Sexual assaults have risen, and I would encourage victims to continue to come forward to report this type of crime.

“A 20.2 per cent drop in the overall number of crimes is the result of a huge amount of work by Police, through planning, intelligence-gathering and use of technology as well as more officers on the beat.

“I’m confident our Police are totally focused on doing even better for the New Zealand public.”
