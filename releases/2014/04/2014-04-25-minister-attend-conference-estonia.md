Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams today leaves for Estonia for the Freedom Online Coalition conference in Estonia, and meetings in London.

The conference is a cross-regional grouping of 22 governments, including Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, committed to protecting free expression on the Internet.

The theme of the conference is a “Free and Secure Internet for All”, and will focus on freedom of expression issues, questions of privacy versus transparency online, and public-private partnerships to advance internet freedom.

Ms Adams will have bilateral meetings with Estonian President Toomas Hendrik *Ilves* and Foreign Minister Urmas Paet. She will also visit the NATO cooperative Cyber Defence Centre.

“I am particularly interested to learn more about the Centre’s analysis of government roles in dealing with cyber security. This is an evolving area, with international cooperation a critical element.”

In London, Ms Adams will meet with Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, and Broadband UK chief executive Chris Townsend.

Ms Adams will also meet with Ofcom, the independent regulator and competition authority for the United Kingdom communications industries. She intends to discuss broadband policy, convergence, the regulation of premium content and consumer broadband information.
