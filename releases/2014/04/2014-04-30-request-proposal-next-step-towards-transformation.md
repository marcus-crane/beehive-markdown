Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation has taken another step towards making tax compliance easier for New Zealanders and their businesses with the release of a Request for Proposal for a design provider, says Revenue Minister Todd McClay.

“This is the biggest transformation in the department’s history, and we’re committed to doing it right using the best services available,” says Mr McClay.

“New Zealand taxpayers, particularly small-to-medium sized businesses, need simpler and faster ways to deal with tax.” 

The MYOB Business Monitor’s January Special Report stated that the greatest wish of business owners was simplification. Not only did this apply to reducing their tax contribution, but also understanding and meeting their obligations, freeing up more time to spend focusing on their businesses.

“A significant aspect of BT will be improving Inland Revenue’s system so that business systems can talk to the IRD automatically.”

“Businesses will automatically fulfil their GST, PAYE and provisional tax obligations while they get on with running their businesses, making profits and creating jobs.”

“Currently small business owners spend far too much of their time and money on tax compliance, which inevitably impacts on their profitability.”

“While Inland Revenue is doing what it can to alleviate this compliance burden, there is only so much that can be done within the current system.”

The closed RFP has been released to Accenture and Capgemini, who were shortlisted during the Expression of Interest phase. Both have extensive international experience in delivering tax and technology programmes, and have been working with New Zealand companies during the process.

“It was always envisaged that the capability and capacity required to implement Business Transformation would come from both New Zealand and overseas.”

“I am advised that both the remaining vendors have committed to work closely with the New Zealand ICT sector to design and build significant parts of the process.”

“It is my expectation that at least one-third of the total services spend on Business Transformation will go to New Zealand businesses.”

“Just this week two young Wellingtonians were chosen to work alongside Inland Revenue to develop a new mobile app, and recently local company Assurity Consulting was chosen as the Department’s preferred testing provider, a contract worth $30 million.”

“Business Transformation is about designing a modern system that reduces compliance costs and means people engage with us less frequently, more simply, and increasingly online,” says Mr McClay.
