Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the finalists for the inaugural Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“The Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards provide an opportunity to publicly recognise, celebrate and share the highly effective education practice we have in New Zealand.

“These awards will help to further lift the status of the teaching profession and drive more improvements for our children and young people.”

Ms Parata says the expert panel chose 16 finalists from 163 entries in five categories.

“I’m delighted the finalists represent early childhood education, primary and secondary schools and secondary-tertiary partnerships.

“The panel have said they had a very high calibre of entries before them and I want to thank them for all the work they have done.
