The 2014 series of EthnicA conferences kicks off in Hamilton tomorrow and Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins is stressing the importance of diverse leadership for New Zealand’s success. 

“As the face and heart of New Zealand becomes more diverse, it’s crucial that leaders in ethnic communities play a more active role shaping decision-making,” says Ms Collins.

“In addition to ethnic Kiwis born in New Zealand, around one in four New Zealanders is now born overseas, with 60 per cent of New Zealand’s workforce growth coming from migrants.

“These conferences bring together Kiwis of different ethnicities and backgrounds to share their experiences and discuss practical ways they can contribute to our nation.”

Ms Collins will be speaking at tomorrow’s EthnicA conference along with community, academic and business leaders such as Joe La Grouw, Marissa Fong, Dr Priya Kurian and Professor Kathryn Pavlovich.

“EthnicA conferences are part of a fantastic pool of programmes organised by the Office of Ethnic Affairs to tap into New Zealand’s ethnic diversity and find new avenues to develop and strengthen leadership across the board,” says Ms Collins.

“It’s important every New Zealander feels inspired and has the opportunity to step into leadership roles in our neighbourhoods, workplaces, on boards and in broader decision making authorities”.
