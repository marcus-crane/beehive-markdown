Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand is supporting the construction of the Pacific’s largest solar energy array in Samoa.

“New Zealand is working in partnership with the Government of Samoa, the European Union, and the Asia Development Bank to increase the generation of renewable energy in Samoa,” Mr McCully says. 

“This will include the construction of 2.2 Megawatt photovoltaic array at the Apia Sports Complex. This array will provide the highest electrical output from a single installation in the Pacific and is a major part of a larger renewable energy programme funded by New Zealand.

“We are also helping to build smaller arrays on the roof of one of the gymnasiums at the Apia Sports Complex and at Salelologa, Savaii.”          

The projects have been commissioned as part of the European Union – New Zealand Energy Access Partnership, launched at the Pacific Energy Summit in 2013.

While in Apia, the Minister also viewed a hydro project which is co-financed by New Zealand the European Union through the Asian Development Bank. The project will rehabilitate three cyclone damaged hydro-electric plants and build at least three new plants.

“Renewable energy is a strong focus of New Zealand’s support to developing countries. The investments in Samoa reflect commitments made at the Pacific Energy Summit in Auckland last year,” Mr McCully says.
