Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart today for the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, North Africa and France to undertake a range of activities and bilateral calls.

“The focus of my bilateral meetings in the UAE and Kuwait will be on strengthening Gulf relationships through ratification of the New Zealand-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement (NZ-GCC FTA), and promoting New Zealand’s value proposition as a food security, investment, and education partner,” Mr Groser says.

“I will attend a range of activities including a key New Zealand food and beverage event showcasing New Zealand produce, a roundtable discussion with some key New Zealand food and beverage exporters based in Dubai, calls on key players responsible for the Dubai World Expo 2020 regarding opportunities for New Zealand construction companies and leveraging the strategic partnership between Emirates Airlines and Airways New Zealand.

“Government leaders play an important role in raising awareness and opening doors in the Middle East. This visit is an excellent opportunity to support trade activities, ongoing bilateral discussions and relationship building, and raise New Zealand’s profile in the market.

“The GCC and the UAE in particular, are an increasingly important export market for New Zealand’s products and services, and a hub for re-export to the wider Middle East and Africa region,” Mr Groser says.

Following the UAE, Mr Groser will travel to Morocco, and Tunisia to undertake a number of bilateral and trade discussions with his ministerial counterparts and local businesses.

Visiting these countries will also provide an opportunity to discuss New Zealand’s United Nations Security Council candidature.

Mr Groser will visit Paris from 3-7 May to attend the annual Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM). While there he will also represent New Zealand at the traditional annual informal WTO Ministers meeting held at the same time as the OECD.

“I will participate at the OECD forum in panels focussed on South East Asian trade and investment. I will also hold bilateral meetings in the margins of the forum with key trade Ministers to help advance New Zealand’s interests in our various free trade agreement negotiations.”
