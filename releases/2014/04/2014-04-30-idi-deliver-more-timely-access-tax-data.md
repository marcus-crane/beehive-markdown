Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson today announced a change to Statistics New Zealand’s Integrated Data Infrastructure platform that will give approved researchers more timely access to tax data.

From June approved IDI researchers will be able to access anonymised tax data within three months of it being supplied from Inland Revenue.  Previously it took 14 months.

“This change will give researchers access to timely and relevant tax data for research and policy advice, and it opens up opportunities for Statistics New Zealand to move to using administrative data first,” Mr Williamson says. 

Anonymised tax data is used by researchers to understand how people enter and leave the labour market, and their employment outcomes.

The Integrated Data Infrastructure platform was established in 2012 as part of the government drive to improve evidence-based policy making and to promote the reuse of high value publicly held data.
