The House sat under extended hours this morning to pass the third readings of the Ngāti Rangiwewehi Claims Settlement Bill, the Tapuika Claims Settlement Bill, and the Ngāti Rangiteaorere Claims Settlement Bill. 

The Ngā Punawai o Te Tokotoru Bill had previously been read as an omnibus bill and today was separated into three individual bills dealing with each of the three iwi’s settlements.  

“Today marks the end of a long journey to settlement for Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Tapuika and Ngāti Rangiteaorere as the iwi take this important step towards a revitalised Treaty relationship,” Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson said.

The Ngāti Rangiwewehi Claims Settlement Bill will settle the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngāti Rangiwewehi. It includes financial and commercial redress of $6 million and the return of culturally significant sites including 37 hectares at Hamurana Springs, Te Riu o Ngata and 6 hectares of the Taumata Scenic Reserve. This will enable Ngāti Rangiwewehi to share their history and culture and to educate and train people about conservation and harvesting.

The Tapuika Claims Settlement Bill will settle the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Tapuika. It includes financial redress of $6 million and the return of 12 sites of special significance to Tapuika across their rohe totalling approximately 209 hectares. It also includes a framework for governance of the Kaituna River, Te Awanui o Tapuika that will acknowledge in a meaningful and practical way Tapuika’s relationship with the river and help protect its ecological and cultural values.

The Ngāti Rangiteaorere Claims Settlement Bill will settle the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngāti Rangiteaorere. It includes $750,000 financial redress as well as statutory acknowledgements and deeds of recognition over Waiohewa stream marginal strip, the Lake Rotorua Marginal strip and Tikitere geothermal field, and the return of 321 hectares of Whakapoungakau, re-uniting Ngāti Rangiteaorere with their maunga.

The unanimous passage of this legislation brings to five the number of Treaty settlement bills passed this year already.

“Today for the third time this year the House has sat in extended sitting hours on a Thursday morning to progress Treaty and non-controversial legislation,” Mr Finlayson said. “It shows the broad support of the parties and members across this House for the settlement of these claims for the benefit of iwi, allowing them to receive the benefits in a timely fashion.”
