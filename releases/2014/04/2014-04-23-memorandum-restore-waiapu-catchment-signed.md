Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Associate Minister Jo Goodhew today announced a collaborative partnership to restore the Waiapu catchment in the Gisborne District.

“The signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between MPI, Te Runanganui O Ngāti Porou and Gisborne District Council demonstrates a long term commitment to work together and with landowners to address the erosion control problems in the catchment.

“The Waiapu River has the highest suspended sediment yield of any river in New Zealand and one of the highest in the world. If nothing is done, erosion and sedimentation could double by 2050.

“This is a great example of this Government working together with iwi and local councils to invest in and develop our regions. This long-term partnership will create significant environmental, cultural, social and economic benefits for iwi and the local community,” says Mr Guy.

Associate Minister Goodhew says the government recognises landowners need as much support as possible to treat erosion on their land, particularly in the gullies where much of the soil loss and sedimentation occurs.

“That is why we recently consulted on operational improvements to the East Coast Forestry Project – a funding programme to assist landowners with their treatment of land to prevent soil erosion, through planting trees or indigenous regeneration.

To date, approximately 42,000 ha have been covered by erosion control treatments under the East Coast Forestry Project.

Approximately 60,000 ha of untreated land are eligible for East Coast Forestry Project funding across the Gisborne District, of which approximately 25,000 ha is in the Waiapu catchment.

The East Coast Forestry Project has $26M available for new soil erosion projects until 2020.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank those of you who made a submission on the operational improvements to the East Coast Forestry Project (ECFP)” says Mrs Goodhew.

The shared vision for the restoration of the Waiapu Catchment by 2113 is: *Ko te mana ko te hauora o te whenua; ko te hauora o nga awa; ko te hauora o te iwi – Healthy land, healthy rivers, healthy people.*

**Editor's notes:**

In December 2010, the Crown and Ngāti Porou leaders signed a deed of settlement (the deed) regarding Ngāti Porou’s historic claims against the Crown. The deed provides for the development of a high-level Relationship Accord signifying a new era of collaboration between Ngāti Porou and the Crown, and commits the Crown to working with iwi and landowners to ‘mitigate severe erosion in the Waiapu catchment’.
