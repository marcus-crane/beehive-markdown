Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is urging road users to slow down and take care this Easter.

“Arriving safely at their destination should be the top priority for everyone travelling on the roads over the long weekend,” Mr Woodhouse says. 

Police will be enforcing a reduced 4km/h threshold over the extended Easter and Anzac holiday period, which will run from 4pm today till 6am on Monday 28 April.

“The results of our Safer Summer campaign show that New Zealand drivers do take road safety seriously, and should be commended for joining with the Police and other agencies to help make the roads safer for everyone.”

Data recently released from Police shows that the two month enforcement of a reduced speed threshold over December and January saw a significant drop in the proportion of drivers exceeding the 100km/h speed limit.

Over Easter weekend 2013 there were 3 fatal crashes and 106 reported injury crashes.

“Already this year there has been five more deaths on our roads than the same time last year. This is a timely reminder to take care and not further add to the road toll.

“Any death or serious injury on our roads is one too many, and is a tragedy for friends, family and the wider community. We all have a part to play in reducing the impact of road trauma. By taking care on the roads, it should be a safe and happy break for everyone,” Mr Woodhouse says.
