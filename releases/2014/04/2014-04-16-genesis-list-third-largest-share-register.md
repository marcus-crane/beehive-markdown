Genesis Energy will have the third-largest New Zealand share register on the NZX when it lists tomorrow, Finance Minister Bill English and State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall say.

More than 68,000 retail investors have been allocated shares in the energy company’s initial public offering – the final IPO in the Government’s share offer programme.

The sale of 49 per cent of Genesis has raised $733 million for the Future Investment Fund, bringing the total proceeds from the share offer programme to $4.7 billion. That money is being spent on other public assets and infrastructure, particularly schools and hospitals, without the need to borrow overseas.

Keen interest in the Genesis offer means scaling has been required across all investor groups including institutions. A progressive scaling policy has been applied to the general offer as part of the Government’s commitment to put New Zealanders at the front of the queue for shares.

“This will see larger applications scaled more significantly than smaller applications,” Mr English says.

“The scaling policy effectively places a cap of approximately $5,000 on all general offer applications.”

“Due to demand in the general offer, the broker firm offer was reduced by 20 per cent, with these shares re-allocated to the general offer.”

At the time of listing, Genesis will be 88 per cent New Zealand-owned.

“After loyalty bonus share allocations, the Crown will retain a 51 per cent shareholding, New Zealand retail investors will hold 26.7 per cent of the company, New Zealand institutions 10 per cent, offshore institutions 12 per cent, and participating iwi will hold 0.3 per cent.

Mr Ryall says the share offer programme has met all of the Government’s objectives.

“Firstly, it has raised billions of dollars that we can spend on assets New Zealanders want, without having to borrow overseas.

“Secondly, through each of the four share offers we have achieved more than 85 per cent New Zealand ownership.

“Thirdly, the share offers have deepened and strengthened our capital markets, with the Mighty River Power, Meridian and Genesis Energy IPOs together adding more than $8.85 billion in capitalisation to the NZX main board.

“Fourthly, 111,000 common shareholder numbers have been issued during the share offer programme, indicating that tens of thousands of New Zealanders have become shareholders for the first time.

“Finally, mixed ownership will be good for the companies themselves, giving them extra scrutiny and accountability, and additional sources of capital.”

Genesis will list on the NZX main board at 1pm tomorrow.

Mr Ryall says retail investors and institutions that did not receive all the shares they applied for will have the opportunity to buy additional shares once Genesis is listed.

Genesis will have the third-largest share register of all listed New Zealand companies, behind Mighty River Power and Contact Energy. Meridian has the fourth largest number of shareholders.
