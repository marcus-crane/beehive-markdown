Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson today welcomed the decision by Statistics New Zealand to reduce fees for academic researchers using its Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) platform.

The IDI gives approved researchers access to anonymised data as part of the Government’s drive to improve evidence-based policy making and promote the reuse of publicly held data.

“Improving access to data from across the public sector will lead to new insights and lift the quality of independent advice Government receives.

“This future-focused initiative is only possible because of the quality of information available, including anonymised tax, education, benefit and migration data.

“It’s a good example of government agencies collaborating to make valuable publicly held data available for reuse,” Mr Williamson says.

New Zealand is one of the first countries in the world to make such data available on an integrated platform.
