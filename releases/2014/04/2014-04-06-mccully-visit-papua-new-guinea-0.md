Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Papua New Guinea today for a visit focused on fostering business links and support for renewable energy projects.

“Papua New Guinea is one of the fastest growing economies in the region, and this visit will include a small New Zealand business delegation,” says Mr McCully.

“The visit to Papua New Guinea is an opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister and a range of senior ministers, including consultations with the Foreign Minister, as well a chance to promote the capability and expertise New Zealand companies can offer.

“The New Zealand delegation will also look at the work being carried out by our aid programme and how we can step up our support for renewable energy in PNG," says Mr McCully.
