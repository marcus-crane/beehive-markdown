Minister for Disability Issues Tariana Turia is saddened at the passing of Beverley Grammer, a passionate advocate for the disability community.

“Beverley worked tirelessly so that those who lived with disability and their families have access to information and resources that enable them to manage their own lives and participate fully in the community,” says Minister Turia.

“Beverley was brought up to believe that anything was possible.  She inspired us all, whether as people with disabilities, providers, family, friends and the wider community, to live our lives to the full, building on our strengths and setting our sights high.”

“Beverley was Managing Director and owner of UP2DATE Consultancy Service – an online disability and support service. She developed and facilitated disability awareness workshops for businesses, community groups and corporate bodies. She also worked as the Information, Advocacy, and Equipment Services Manager at the Disabilities Resource Centre Trust in Whakatane. Beverley also held numerous positions on various organisations in her advocacy work for the disabled.”

“Beverley’s passing will leave a huge gap in the lives of so many and her work for the disabled community will never be forgotten. My deepest sympathies and aroha go to her parents, extended family, friends and colleagues. Moe mai rā ki tō moenga roa e Beverley.”
