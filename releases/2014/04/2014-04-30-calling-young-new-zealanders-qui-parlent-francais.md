Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced that applications are now open for four young French-speaking New Zealanders to represent New Zealand on 14 July at the Bastille Day Parade in Paris.

“French President François Hollande has invited New Zealand to send two young women and two young men, aged between 18 and 24, to participate in the 2014 Bastille Day Parade,” Mr Finlayson said. “They will join youth from around 70 other countries that were involved in the First World War. France is using this year’s National Day to mark the upcoming centenary of the First World War.”

“As we saw on Anzac Day, the number of young New Zealanders attending services around the country to honour those New Zealanders  who have died in conflicts and acknowledge the contribution of all those who have served, continues to grow.”

“I encourage young French-speaking New Zealanders to apply for this unique opportunity and join me in representing our nation and their generation. New Zealand has a long and proud history of contributing to global peace and security on the international stage,” he said.

The shortlisted candidates will meet with Mr Finlayson before the final selection process begins. The successful candidates will be announced early June. Applications are open until 12 May and can be made online at [http://tinyurl.com/nzbastille](http://tinyurl.com/nzbastille)

 

The Bastille Day Parade Youth Programme is funded by the French and New Zealand governments and supported by the WW100 Programme Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Youth Development and New Zealand Defence Force. The Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Christopher Finlayson, will attend the Bastille Day Parade as a representative of the New Zealand government.
