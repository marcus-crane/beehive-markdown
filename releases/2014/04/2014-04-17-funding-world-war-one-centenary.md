Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne (Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board) has today announced that the Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee has approved funding of over $9.1 million towards 80 projects which commemorate World War One.

“The types of projects that have been funded are very diverse in nature, and will help New Zealanders commemorate a significant event in New Zealand’s history”,  Minister Dunne said. 

“I would like to acknowledge and thank the Committee Members, who were supported by members of the First World War Centenary Panel, for their work in determining which projects should be funded”.

The largest grant awarded is $3.8 million, which has been made to the Auckland War Memorial Museum to enable the museum to undertake the Cenotaph Home and Community project.  This will involve the museum conducting exhibitions, events, public programmes, development of resources, and learning projects throughout the commemoration period.   

A key focus of the funding has been to support community initiatives, which will enable New Zealanders to take part in commemorative activities as part of their local community.  Key grants include:

- $85,135 made to the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum Board for the digitisation of images of World War One artefacts and the creation of a Canterbury 100 website to commemorate World War One; and
- $43,104 made to Petone Settlers Museum for World War One themed exhibition and programme, which tells the story of what the war meant for New Zealanders, both those soldiers who fought and the people who stayed at home. The exhibition will be launched in August 2014 and run throughout the centenary period.

During 2013 and 2014 the Committee has approved over $17.2 million to organisations to enable them to undertake projects, events and activities to commemorate the First World War. 

“The projects funded recognise the importance of this centenary event to New Zealand, and provide New Zealanders the opportunity to remember those who fought and served for their country during the First World War” says Minister Dunne.

Successful applicants will be advised of the outcome of their application in the following days.  A full list of all grants made by the Committee will be made available on the Community Matters website ([www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz)) by 2 May 2014.
