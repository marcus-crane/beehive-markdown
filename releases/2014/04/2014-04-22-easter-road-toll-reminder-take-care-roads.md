Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is urging motorists to take care over the rest of the extended break.  

The official Easter holiday period finished this morning, with a provisional road toll of four. However, with another public holiday falling on Friday, and school holidays this week, many New Zealanders will still be travelling.

“Another four families are grieving this week, and my sympathy is with them, and all others who have been impacted by road crashes,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“I urge road users to take care to prevent more tragedies. Watch your speed and following distance, drive to the conditions and people will reach their destinations safely these holidays.”

The Easter road toll was three in 2013. The lowest Easter road toll was no deaths in 2012. The highest recorded number of deaths was 21 in 1971.

“It is important that we remain vigilant on the roads all year long. Already this year more than 80 families have lost loved ones due to road crashes, and many more are dealing with the consequences of serious injuries.’’
