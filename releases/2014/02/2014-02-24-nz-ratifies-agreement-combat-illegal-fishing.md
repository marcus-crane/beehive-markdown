Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy today announced New Zealand has ratified an international fisheries agreement designed to fight illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Port State Measures Agreement sets minimum standards for port access by foreign flagged fishing vessels and related support vessels.

“Widespread implementation of the agreement will make it more difficult and less economic to undertake IUU fishing,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand has been at the forefront of international efforts to combat IUU fishing. Ratifying this agreement further cements our commitment.”

New Zealand is the ninth country to ratify the agreement, which requires 25 ratifications to come into force.

“For New Zealand, it will means our fishers can operate in high value international fisheries with less threat of IUU fishers, while ensuring sustainability of our oceans,” Mr Guy says.

“Supporting an international framework that enables long-term sustainable use of fisheries resources is important for New Zealand.”
