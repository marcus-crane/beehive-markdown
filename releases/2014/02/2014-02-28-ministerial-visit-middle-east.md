Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy leaves tomorrow on a visit to Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

“This visit is an opportunity to build on New Zealand’s already well-established relationship with key agricultural and food export markets,” says Mr Guy.

“In 2013 New Zealand exported $1.6b of primary products to these three markets, and our agricultural expertise is in strong demand as states in the region look to improve their food security.”

In the United Arab Emirates Mr Guy will be discussing a joint project with Environment Abu Dhabi where New Zealand is assisting with environmental management. He will also open Fonterra's new warehouse, which will operate as a hub for re-exports throughout the region and signals the importance of the Gulf region to New Zealand's dairy exports.

While in Saudi Arabia he will meet with his ministerial counterpart and also visit the site of a New Zealand agribusiness service hub and demonstration farm currently under development near Dammam.

In Oman Minister Guy will also be meeting both the Agriculture and Foreign Affairs Ministers and will be holding discussions on increasing trade and agricultural linkages.

“Launched last year, the NZ Inc Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Strategy outlines New Zealand’s plans for further developing strong government and private sector relationships with the GCC. It calls for expanded trade and economic relationships with region.

“This visit will help to grow our relationship and help New Zealand become a partner of choice. It will also be an opportunity to discuss how we can work with the states of the region in areas where we have particular expertise, such as agriculture, fisheries and environmental management,” says Mr Guy.
