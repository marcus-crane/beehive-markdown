Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will open a Consulate General in Honolulu to strengthen ties with northern Pacific nations.

New Zealand’s Consul General in Honolulu will be cross-accredited to Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

“With the Pacific Islands Forum in the Marshall Islands last year and Palau this year, the region’s attention is focused on the northern Pacific and the unique issues these island nations face,” Mr McCully says.

“We want to advance our relationship with the people and governments of the northern Pacific and opening a Consulate General in Honolulu is a practical way of demonstrating New Zealand’s commitment to these countries.

“It will allow us to work more closely with US officials and experts on regional security and development issues. Honolulu is a natural focus for cooperation with the United States as it stands at the centre of US strategic, cultural and academic engagement in the Asia-Pacific.”

The Consulate will also provide support to New Zealanders travelling to the northern Pacific as well as New Zealanders in transit to the mainland US and other destinations.
