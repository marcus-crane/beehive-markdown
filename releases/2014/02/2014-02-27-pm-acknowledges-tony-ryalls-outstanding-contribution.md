Prime Minister John Key has thanked Minister Tony Ryall for his remarkable service to the National Party, his Bay of Plenty electorate and New Zealand.

Mr Ryall announced this morning his decision to retire from politics at the election later this year.

“Tony has provided 24 long years of loyal service,’’ says Mr Key.

“In recent years he has been an extremely effective Minister of Health and Minister of State Owned Enterprises. He has also played an important leadership role among social sector Ministers and made an outstanding contribution on many other fronts.

“Tony will leave the health service in far better shape than he found it back in 2008 and while we are really sad to lose him, we support his decision.

“I particularly would like to thank Kara and family for the enormous support they've given Tony and we wish him the best for his future endeavours.

“It is my intention that Tony will remain a Minister in all his portfolios until he leaves Parliament.”
