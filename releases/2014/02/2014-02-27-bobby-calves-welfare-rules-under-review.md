Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has instructed officials to consult on prohibiting the use of blunt force to euthanise bobby calves on farms.

“After speaking to industry leaders, I have asked the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC) to consider an amendment to the Animal Welfare (Dairy Cattle) Code of Welfare 2010,” says Mr Guy.

“New Zealand’s animal welfare system is amongst the best in the world, but I believe the time has come to review the use of blunt force. Industry groups do not recommend it as best practice for euthanising calves, and as a humane society we have a responsibility to look after animals and avoid unnecessary suffering.

“The vast majority of farmers in New Zealand care about their animals and do a good job of looking after them. While I don’t believe this practice is widespread, I have real concerns about this and the potential damage it could do to our reputation.”

NAWAC will begin public consultation soon on the proposed amendment. A final decision will be made in mid-year after receiving final advice.

“As part of this consultation, consideration will be given to emergency cases where a farmer might discover a suffering animal in a remote location and only have access to limited equipment.

“The Animal Welfare Amendment Bill is currently before the Select Committee and will further strengthen the Act. It allows for the creation of enforceable regulations that will complement the minimum standards contained within New Zealand’s 16 codes of welfare.”

“The Ministry for Primary Industries already takes a tough line on animal cruelty and there have been a number of major prosecutions over the last couple of years. Animal welfare inspectors and compliance officers visit farms, provide advice and education to animal owners and enforce the law,” says Mr Guy.
