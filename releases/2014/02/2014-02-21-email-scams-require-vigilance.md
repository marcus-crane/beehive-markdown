Revenue Minister Todd McClay today issued a warning to New Zealanders to be wary of email scams promising tax refunds.

“Over the last few days I have been made aware of a number of people, including myself, who have received emails advising that they are eligible for a tax refund. The email suggests they have been contacted by Inland Revenue,” Mr McClay says.

“An important point I wish to get across to New Zealanders is that Inland Revenue will never send you an email that asks you to provide personal information, or contains a direct link to a page to submit such information.”

“If you receive such an email it is not from Inland Revenue, do not open it.”

“Simply delete the email.”

“Opening the email risks making your email address and other personal tax information available to scammers who will target you further.”

Inland Revenue will never direct you to any website except [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz).

“If you have received a suspicious email please forward the email you received to [phishing@ird.govt.nz](mailto:phishing@ird.govt.nz)  or contact Inland Revenue on 0800 227 774.”

“Those that have replied to these scams and given money or personal details need to contact their bank or credit card provider immediately.”

“It is important people are aware that these emails are out there, the need to be cautious, and what to do if they find themselves caught up in such a scam,” Mr McClay says
