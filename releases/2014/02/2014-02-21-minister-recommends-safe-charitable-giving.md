Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is encouraging generous New Zealanders to research organisations before donating to them.

“It is important when giving donations to take some simple steps to make sure your money is going to a legitimate charity,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“There are 26,891 registered charities in New Zealand managing an asset base of $40 billion. Together they have an annual income of $14.7 billion – of which 7.5 per cent comes from donations, equating to around $1.1 billion.

“With such a large amount of money being donated every year, this sector can be an attractive target for unscrupulous people.

“To donate with confidence, I encourage people to give to registered charities. Being on the charities register provides assurance that an organisation has a legitimate charitable purpose.

“There is also the bonus that donations to registered charities can be eligible for tax credits.

“If you’re not sure if a charity is registered you can ask for a registration number, check the organisation’s website or search for them on the register which is held at [www.charities.govt.nz](http://www.charities.govt.nz)

“New Zealanders are very giving people, it’s a wonderful attribute and is something to be admired and encouraged,” says Mrs Goodhew.
