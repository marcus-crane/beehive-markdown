Programmes for the Festival of Education are now being finalised, Education Minister Hekia Parata says.

“I am delighted to see the wide range of involvement and support from educators, students, agencies and communities in our Festival of Education programmes. Each Festival programme reflects the uniqueness of the cities where they are taking place.

“The Festivals of Education are all about celebrating excellence and innovation in our education system, and the teachers, students, parents and community who all contribute to this.”

I want to acknowledge what a great partnership the festivals are between the profession, Cognition Education and the many businesses and civic partnerships, and the government,” Ms Parata says.

The Festivals of Education are open to all. A wide range of activities are planned – suited to all ages and levels of educational expertise - including inspiring speakers, interactive displays, activities, food and performance.

Educators, students and their families, educational organisations and community leaders will come together to celebrate and share ideas, inspiration, success and best practice around the Festival theme of Collaboration, Innovation, Cohesion and Celebration.

The Festival of Education programmes includes chat room sessions and panel discussions covering educational trends and issues that participants are welcome to participate in. The exhibition area showcases and celebrates educational innovation, collaboration and achievement.

“I have also been delighted with the popularity of the inspiredbyU website, which is a part of the Festival programme. Thousands of people have now viewed the hundreds of inspiring entries on the website recognising an inspiring teacher in their lives,” says Ms Parata.

Everyone is welcome to contribute their inspiring teacher story at [www.inspiredbyU.org.nz](http://www.inspiredbyU.org.nz)

The Festivals of Education will take place in Auckland 21-23 March at the Viaduct Events Centre, Christchurch 23 March Wigram Air Force Museum and in Wellington on 29 March at TSB Bank Arena, Shed 6 and Frank Kitts Park.
