The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Te Kawerau a Maki at Makaurua Marae in Mangere, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Crown was represented at the signing by Mr Finlayson, Minister for Whanau Ora Tariana Turia and Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga. The signing was witnessed by Members of Parliament Claudette Hauiti and Tau Henare. The Maori King, Kiingi Tuheitia, and representatives of other iwi also attended.

Te Kawerau a Maki’s claims are based on the Crown’s actions and omissions, including extensive Crown purchases in the three decades following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

What reserves that had been set aside for Te Kawerau a Maki were never protected and were gradually alienated from tribal control.  Te Kawerau a Maki were rendered virtually landless.  This had a severe impact on the health and well-being of the Te Kawerau a Maki community with effects that continue to be felt today.

"Te Kawerau a Maki has waited a long time to reach this day,” Mr Finlayson said. "While we can never fully compensate for the wrongs of the past, this settlement will enable the people of Te Kawerau a Maki to focus on developing a strong cultural and economic future.”

"The settlement includes the purchase of 86% of Riverhead Crown Forest Licence land which will be a significant commercial asset for Te Kawerau a Maki.”

The settlement includes cultural, financial and commercial redress of $6.5 million (all of which is used to purchase Riverhead Forest), land at Te Onekiritea Point (Hobsonville), and a contribution of $300,000 to the establishment of a Te Kawerau a Maki Marae. Further cultural redress includes the vesting of nine significant cultural sites to the iwi.

"Signing this deed of settlement signifies a new relationship between the Crown and Te Kawerau a Maki and is a significant step towards the goal of settling Treaty claims in Auckland and all historical grievances across New Zealand,” Mr Finlayson said.

It is the 69th deed of settlement signed by the Crown.

The settlement will be given effect through legislation.
