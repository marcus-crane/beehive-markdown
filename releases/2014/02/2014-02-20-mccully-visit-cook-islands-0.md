Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to the Cook Islands today for the third New Zealand-Cook Islands Joint Ministerial Forum.

“These annual ministerial talks reflect the value we place on our unique constitutional relationship of shared citizenry and currency,” Mr McCully says.

“The discussions will cover a range of topics including economic reform, regional and international issues and New Zealand’s substantial development programme.”

While in Rarotonga, Mr McCully will attend the ground-breaking of the Te Mato Vai project – a $65 million partnership between New Zealand, China and the Cook Islands to replace the island’s aging water network.

“Our commitment to the innovative Te Mato Vai project will promote further development in the Cook Islands while safe-guarding tourism gains.”

Mr McCully will also visit the islands of Aitutaki, Mitiaro and Aitu.
