Associate Minister of Health Tariana Turia has praised a group of smokers who are trying to quit the habit with the use of nicotine replacement therapy.

The University of Otago Wellington nicotine replace therapy trial has been underway for a month at Queensgate mall in Lower Hutt and has seen 256 smokers trial the product. The trial offers smokers the chance to sample a range of nicotine replacement therapies under the guidance of an expert coach at shopping malls and other public spaces.

“We know that giving up smoking is extremely difficult for many smokers because of the addictive nature of nicotine that is present in tobacco. We must do all we can to help smokers quit and to prevent any more people from taking up the habit. We welcome cessation programmes that give smokers the support and confidence they need to quit. We know that many smokers give up only to take up the habit again because they have not had the support in place,” says Minster Turia.

“It is heartening to see this trial have such positive results and I congratulate those who have made a conscious effort to give up smoking. We know it is not an easy journey. We know that most smokers really want to quit and that they do not want to see their children take up the habit. So its pleasing to see good interest in this new product. The initial results of this trial are promising and give room for fresh optimism about the pathway to a smoke free Aotearoa by 2025.”

The trial is now extending, with stalls due to open at North City Mall in Porirua and in the Palmerston North and Manawatu area in March. The trial has been funded by the Ministry of Health Innovation Fund to help New Zealand achieve the smoke free nation goal by 2025.
