Consultation hui on the proposed new Māori Language Strategy will take place between 10 – 21 February 2014, announced Māori Affairs Minister, Dr. Pita Sharples.

Dr. Sharples said “Te Reo Māori is unique to us in Aotearoa. It’s the indigenous language of this place, and in the lead up to Waitangi Day it’s important to remember our collective responsibility to protect our unique language, culture and identity.”

“The draft strategy, which I released in December, proposes that we focus on supporting language learning in the home; and also outlines new governance arrangements for Te Taura Whiri, Te Mangai Pāho and the Māori Television Service which would give Māori/iwi an increased governance role.”

Dr Sharples said “these consultation hui are an opportunity to put forward your views on these proposals and the Government’s planned approach to supporting Te Reo Māori into the future.”

Dr. Sharples will be presenting the draft Māori Language Strategy to Iwi Leaders during the Waitangi celebrations in the Bay of Islands this week. He will also attend all consultation hui being held across the country.

Details about each hui are listed below, and information on the proposed new Māori Language Strategy is available on the Te Puni Kōkiri website [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz). Anyone who wishes to make a written submission on the proposals may do so by email or post. The closing date for written submissions is 28 February 2014.
