Police Minister Anne Tolley says there has been a 155 per cent increase in foot patrols over the last two years, with officers using technology and enhanced intelligence-gathering to reduce crime even further.

Police foot patrols increased from 40,918 in 2011 to 104,321 in 2013, while recorded crimes have dropped by 17.4 per cent over the last three fiscal years.

“Our Police are getting great results, and are completely focused on making our communities even safer,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Officers are much more visible, and through intelligence-gathering are on the beat in known ‘hot-spots’ at times when there is a higher risk of crime taking place. This acts as a deterrent to criminals, prevents crimes, and leads to fewer victims.

“Following last year’s rollout, frontline officers now have smartphones and tablets, which allow them to spend an extra 30 minutes per shift out in communities preventing crime.

“This is the equivalent of an additional 354 frontline staff, and is delivering over half a million additional frontline Police hours per year.

“The National-led Government has ensured that our Police are better-resourced than ever before to tackle crime.

“Officers are much more effective out in communities rather than waiting in stations to react to crime, and I want to thank them for making such a difference.”
