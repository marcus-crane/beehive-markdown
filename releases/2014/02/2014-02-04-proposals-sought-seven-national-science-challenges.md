The Government today issued a request for proposals for research funding for the second tranche of New Zealand’s National Science Challenges.  The second tranche comprises seven Challenges with total funding of up to $438.6 million over 10 years.

Research areas for the 10 National Science Challenges were announced in May 2013.  The seven Challenges in the second tranche are:

- Ageing Well (Kia eke kairangi ki te taikaumātuatanga) – harnessing science to sustain health and wellbeing into the later years of life (up to $34.9 million over 10 years)
- A Better Start (E tipu e rea) – improving the potential of young New Zealanders to have a healthy and successful life (up to $34.7 million over 10 years)
- Healthier Lives (He oranga hauora) – research to reduce the burden of major New Zealand health problems (up to $31.3 million over 10 years)
- New Zealand’s Biological Heritage (Ngā koiora tuku iho) – protecting and managing our biodiversity, improving our biosecurity, and enhancing our resilience to harmful organisms (up to $63.7 million over 10 years)
- Our Land and Water (Toitū te whenua, toiora te wai) – research to enhance primary sector production and productivity while maintaining our land and water quality for future generations (up to $96.9 million over 10 years)
- Sustainable Seas (Ko ngā moana whakauka) – understanding how we can utilise our marine resources within environmental and biological constraints (up to $71.1 million over 10 years)
- Science for Technological Innovation (Kia kotahi mai – te ao pūtaiao me te ao hangarau) – enhancing the capacity of New Zealand to use physical and engineering sciences for economic growth (up to $106.0 million over 10 years).

“The Challenges take a strategic approach to the key science issues facing New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says. 

“The Challenges are designed to bring together New Zealand’s top scientists to work collaboratively across disciplines.  The Government is looking for proposals that clearly outline how research will make a real impact in each Challenge area.”

Each Challenge includes new funding and funds that will become available as current Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment research contracts directly related to each Challenge mature.  The new Challenge money comprises $73.5 million over four years in Budget 2013, in addition to the $60 million allocated in Budget 2012, and $30.5 million per year thereafter.   

Proposals for the second tranche of Challenges are due by the end of April.   Proposals will be assessed by independent assessment panels and decisions on Challenge proposals and the allocation of funding will be made by the Science Board.
