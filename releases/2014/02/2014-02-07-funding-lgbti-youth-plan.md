Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $55,000 in funding through the Ministry of Youth Development to help strengthen services available to LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender or intersex) youth.

“There are a number of organisations around New Zealand that have been delivering health and services to LGBTI youth but they need to be able to better co-ordinate a plan to address issues like bullying and suicide,” Ms Kaye says.

“Research shows that young people from the LGBTI community face higher rates of bullying, and are more likely to have attempted suicide than other youth.

“This funding will support a range of LGBTI organisations to develop a plan to better address these issues. The plan will also provide a view on how to ensure services are provided to young people in a sustainable way.

“I also want to encourage and support better access for LGBTI youth to development and leadership opportunities. This could be a deliverable of the plan.”

The Ministry of Youth Development will work with key LGBTI youth-focused organisations to ensure everyone who wants to make a contribution to improving service accessibility and effectiveness has the opportunity to do so.

“It is important that we have good information about LGBTI young people,” Ms Kaye says.

The Ministry of Youth Development will work with the University of Auckland to analyse the most recent information obtained from young people through *Youth 2012 The health and wellbeing of secondary school students in New Zealand: Results for young people attracted to the same sex or both sexes.*

A report will be produced for researchers, interested groups and government agencies to use for planning and service development purposes.
