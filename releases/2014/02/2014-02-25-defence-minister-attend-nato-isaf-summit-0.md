Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman is joining his international counterparts at this week’s NATO-ISAF Defence Ministers meeting in Brussels.

“The NATO-ISAF summit is a good opportunity to discuss the ISAF drawdown and planning for NATO’s post-2014 training, advice and assistance mission in Afghanistan,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand remains committed to supporting the final stages of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan to December 2014. It is important to secure the gains made by the international community over the last decade.

“Our 27 NZDF personnel make a small but valuable contribution. The Government has previously confirmed that a small number of personnel are expected to remain at the UK-led Afghan National Army Officer Training Academy in training assistance and capacity building roles beyond 2014.”

New Zealand is also committed to supporting NATO in areas of common interest. The NATO-ISAF summit is a useful opportunity to discuss and highlight New Zealand’s contribution to international maritime security efforts.

“HMNZS Te Mana has recently successfully completed a short deployment to NATO’s anti-piracy mission, Operation Ocean Shield, in the Gulf of Aden region,” says Dr Coleman.

“As a trading nation New Zealand recognises the importance of maritime security, and we are committed to contributing to the international effort to tackle piracy.”

Dr Coleman will hold a number of bilateral meetings at the NATO-ISAF summit with NATO leaders and counterparts from a range of countries.

Following the NATO-ISAF summit on 26-27 February 2014, Dr Coleman will travel to New York for a range of meetings in support of New Zealand’s UN Security Council campaign.
