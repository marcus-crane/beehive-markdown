Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will tonight host a Parliamentary celebration of Chinese New Year alongside one of New Zealand’s largest ethnic groups and says it’s a symbol of our enthusiasm and embrace of cultural diversity.

“People across Asia are welcoming in the Year of the Horse and it’s wonderful that here in New Zealand Kiwis from all walks of life are joining in the festivities,” says Ms Collins.

“An increasing number of New Zealanders identify with ethnicities originating in Asia. New Zealand’s third largest ethnic group is Chinese with China being the second most common place of birth for those born overseas.

“Our national culture is richer as a result and now, more than ever, we are seeing how much we can share, gain and learn from this wealth of international knowledge and experience.

“Having a Parliamentary celebration of Chinese New Year is one of the many ways we can recognise the fantastic contribution these New Zealanders make in our communities, businesses and in leadership positions.

“Their pioneering, innovative and entrepreneurial spirit continues to strengthen great progress in many sectors of our economy.

“As a Government we are dedicated to supporting this and making sure that every New Zealander can reach their full potential and be a part of our national success”.

Chinese New Year (also known as Lunar New Year and other country-specific names) is based on the Chinese lunar calendar and is a major festival for many countries in Asia where this calendar is widely used.

Tonight’s Parliamentary celebration will be attended by about 180 guests including community leaders, diplomatic representatives and Members of Parliament.
