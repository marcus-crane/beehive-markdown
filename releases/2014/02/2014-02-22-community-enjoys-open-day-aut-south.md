Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, today welcomed recent developments to AUT’s South campus which have improved its accessibility to the community.

“Fifteen per cent of the student population at AUT are Pacific, so it is important that we have a university in Counties Manukau that is open and welcoming to Pacific students and the wider Pacific community and families,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

Speaking at the open day for AUT South at the University campus today, Mr Lotu-Iiga praised AUT for its commitment to providing world class education in the heart of Counties Manukau.

“Counties Manukau is home to one of New Zealand’s youngest and fastest growing populations, making it essential to have accessible and world class education on our door step.

“Since opening in 2010, AUT South has developed into a cornerstone of the local community.

“Last year’s Government announcement to increase the number of Equivalent Full Time Students at AUT from 940 in 2013 to 4,100 by 2020 shows that the Government is serious about lifting the participation and achievement of Pacific people in tertiary education.

Over 1,500 people attended the open day which provided a chance for the public to view the redeveloped campus, learn about study options at AUT and enjoy entertainment from Che Fu and other local musicians.

“Today was about showcasing AUT South to the wider community. It is a world-class educational facility that will have long-lasting benefits for the students, their families and the wider community,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.
