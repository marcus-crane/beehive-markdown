Minister Responsible for Novopay Steven Joyce today released the reports on complaints and notifications received in regards to Pay Period 22 and 23 of the schools’ payroll.

Pay Period 22, which was paid on the morning of 22 January, paid 60,638 people a total of $140.26 million. The report for that pay shows complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.18 per cent of staff across the country, 13 staff were notified as not paid, 60 were overpaid, and 34 underpaid. Affected staff were from 68 schools or 2.77 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

Pay Period 23 paid 74,578 people a total of $146.87 million on the morning of 5 February. The complaints report for that payday shows that complaints and notifications were received regarding 0.69 per cent of staff across the country, 234 staff were notified as not paid, 107 were overpaid, and 175 underpaid. Affected staff were from 268 schools or 11.07 per cent of schools in the payroll system.

“The performance of Pay Period 23 was not as good as we’ve recently been experiencing. The result has us slightly above the 0.5 per cent acceptable steady state error level as defined by the Novopay technical review last year. This is the first time we have been above that level since the beginning of April last year (21 pay periods ago),” Mr Joyce says.

“Early indications are that there was no particular software error that caused the non-payments. It appears at this stage to be due to a range of data entry errors.

“The Pay Period 23 result underlines the high level of complexity of the education payroll end of year/start of year processes in which considerable administrative changes need to be made.  The New Zealand education payroll is the most complex in New Zealand and more work remains to be done to simplify the business processes to ensure it runs as smoothly as possible each year. This work and completing outstanding work on leave balances are the early priorities this year.

“The 234 staff notified as not paid, have either been paid or are in the process of being paid.  We apologise to those who have been inconvenienced.  If a school staff member needs further assistance, they should contact the Education Ministry as soon as possible.”
