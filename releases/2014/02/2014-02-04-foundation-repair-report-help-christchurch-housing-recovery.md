A new technical report on housing foundation will help lift the pace of Christchurch’s housing recovery, Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith said today.

“The problem of what to do with the tens of thousands of homes with damaged foundations is difficult, expensive and hugely frustrating for homeowners. This technical report is a major step forward in determining what can be fixed, at what cost, and with what method,” Dr Smith, who has a PhD in geotechnical engineering, says.

“The problem of housing foundation damage is a very difficult issue for insurers, engineers and builders. The scale of the damage to housing foundations from liquefaction in Christchurch is unprecedented internationally.

“Engineers and builders are having to learn as they go on what repairs are effective, what methods to use and where it is economically viable. This report is about sharing engineering and cost information to help the pace of Christchurch housing recovery.

“The Government has encouraged the Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) and Southern Response, two publically owned entities, to publish this information. We should not be too precious about issues of commercial sensitivity or intellectual property. Christchurch’s interests will be best served by people being open as possible in sharing information and experiences on how to get Christchurch’s houses repaired or replaced as quickly as possible.

“I commend HNZC, Southern Response and their technical support partners in producing this report. We must now use this information to lift the pace of Christchurch’s housing rebuild,” Dr Smith concluded.
