Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says 2000 schools have now registered their interest in joining the Network for Learning (N4L) managed network, with 150 already connected.

“This Government is investing $211 million to provide schools with safe, predictable and fast internet with uncapped data, content filtering and network security services,” Ms Kaye says.

“We are focused on ensuring every student can benefit from technology to achieve their best, no matter where they are in New Zealand.

“Across the country, schools are starting to gain access to reliable, ultra-fast broadband from N4L, regardless of their location and with no cost or data cap. This enables the use of state-of-the-art digital technology in classrooms and allows students and teachers to explore innovative approaches to teaching and learning.

“The pace at which schools are connecting to the Government-funded managed network service is encouraging, and we’re expecting 700 schools to connect by the end of this year. All schools will be invited to connect by 2016.

“A fully-funded connection to the N4L network includes the cost of online content filtering and network security services. With increasing use of digital technologies, these services are more important than ever to ensure schools can provide secure and safe internet access for students and staff,” Ms Kaye says.
