Claims the Government will scrap the EasyVote card are wrong and irresponsible, Justice Minister Judith Collins says.

Labour’s Justice spokesperson Andrew Little made a number of misleading assertions during the second reading of the Electoral Amendment Bill in Parliament last night.

“The Bill, as reported back by the Justice and Electoral Select Committee, makes no change to the EasyVote card for the 2014 general election,” Ms Collins says.

“When introduced, the Bill included a proposal from the Electoral Commission and recommended by the Justice and Electoral Committee in its report on the 2011 general election, to extend the current use of the EasyVote card.

“However after further consideration the Justice and Electoral Committee, which includes members of the National, Labour, Green and New Zealand First parties, voted unanimously against extending the use of the EasyVote card,” Ms Collins says.

“There was unanimous concern expressed from all parties that expanded use of the cards may lower the threshold for casting a vote, increasing the potential for fraud and harming the integrity of the voting process.”

Ms Collins says there was never any intention to remove the EasyVote card which is a very useful tool for voters and electoral staff.

“These sorts of disingenuous comments from Mr Little that incite doubt in the electoral system, particularly in an election year, are extremely irresponsible. Next time it would help if Mr Little actually read the Bill and talked to his colleagues before making false claims.”
