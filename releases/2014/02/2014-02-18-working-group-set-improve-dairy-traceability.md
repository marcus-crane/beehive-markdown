Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Food Safety Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a working group set up to improve dairy traceability.

“The independent Government Inquiry into the Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) Contamination Incident highlighted the importance of effective systems for dairy traceability,” Mr Guy says.

“The Inquiry recommended lifting the dairy sector’s ability to trace products and ingredients through a working group focusing on regulatory and worldwide best practices.”

“Improving the traceability of dairy products will further protect the public in the event of a suspected food safety issue,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is well advanced in setting up a working group that will be headed by independent chair Dr John Larkindale.

“The working group will include representatives from the dairy and wider food industries and will investigate possible changes to regulations and industry practices to improve food and ingredient traceability,” Ms Kaye says.

The traceability working group will report to MPI Director General Martyn Dunne.  Members will be appointed from:

- Food and Grocery Council
- New Zealand Retailers Association
- GS1 New Zealand
- Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand (DCANZ) representative of large-scale manufacturers
- DCANZ representative of small-scale producers of retail-ready dairy products
- Infant Nutrition Council
- New Zealand Infant Formula Exporters’ Association
- One member each from MPI and AsureQuality

“MPI advises me that the group’s membership will be finalised this month and it will have its first meeting in March to determine its terms of reference and work programme, including timeframes for reporting back,” Ms Kaye says.

“Collectively the group will have a range of important skills, including an understanding of best practice for traceability at a regulatory and industry level; first-hand knowledge of how dairy supply chains work; international experience; and experience with New Zealand’s regulatory frameworks,” Mr Guy says.

“The independent inquiry into last year’s WPC incident found that New Zealand’s food safety regulatory model for dairy is consistent with international principles and is among the best in the world. These changes will further strengthen the system.”

“It is crucial for government and industry to work together on this issue. In order to have full traceability, both government and industry systems must be robust and aligned,” Ms Kaye says.
