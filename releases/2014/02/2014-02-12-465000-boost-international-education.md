Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced the Government will invest $465,000 co-funding a dozen new growth initiatives in the international education industry.

Successful recipients of the second round of International Education Growth Fund (IEGF) grants include Massey University, which is developing a new joint degree programme in China, and a group of Auckland schools working together to pilot a recruitment programme in several South American countries. 

The IEGF is designed to boost New Zealand’s international education industry by co-funding new and innovative opportunities targeted at international markets. The fund is a component of the industry development programme which expanded from $1 million to $2 million a year as part of the internationally focused growth initiatives in Budget 2013.

“New Zealand’s future prosperity depends on our ability to successfully export our products and services internationally, and that includes the delivery of New Zealand education offshore, as well as recruiting more students to study here,” Mr Joyce says.

“International education is an important part of our economy and we’re committed to doubling the value of the industry to New Zealand to $5 billion by 2025.

“The first round of funding released in June 2013 has already delivered results: Wellington-based company Software Education, has launched five new courses in Singapore and signed six new partnerships with US organisations; and Kiwa Digital, of Auckland, has used its funding to close international contracts valued at $386,000.”

The International Education Growth Fund is administered by Education New Zealand, the lead agency for the promotion of international education. Education providers and business can apply for matched funding up to $50,000 but must invest a minimum of $10,000 themselves.

To date the Education New Zealand has approved matched funding of more than $1.4 million for 41 projects with a combined value, including the applicants’ contributions, of more than $2.8 million. Applications for round three of the International Education Growth Fund open in March.
