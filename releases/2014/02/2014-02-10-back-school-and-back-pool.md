This week will see many children back at school and getting back in the pool with help from KiwiSport says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Exercise and sport are vitally important to health. That’s why $7 million of health funding goes into the Sport NZ led KiwiSport programme – making up around a third of the government’s contribution each year,” says Mr Ryall.

“Sport Canterbury is one of 17 sports trusts around the country involved in the KiwiSport initiative launched by the Prime Minister in 2009.

“Last year 11,000 Canterbury children attended learn to swim classes through KiwiSport, another 4,700 played touch rugby and a further 400 played cricket through the programme.

Mr Ryall said the benefits of regular exercise are well known.

“The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says exercise can help control weight, strengthen bones and muscles, improve mental health, and reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

“Getting more kids involved at school level can also lead to a lifetime of involvement in sport,” says Mr Ryall.
