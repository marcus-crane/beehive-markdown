Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson has paid tribute to Lambton Quay landmark Parsons Books and Music as it prepares to close its doors after 66 years in business.

Brother and sister Julian and Beatrice Parsons are retiring from the bookshop founded by their father, as Roy Parsons Bookseller, in 1948.

“As a customer from long before I entered Parliament to the present day I am personally sad at the closure of this special Wellingtonian institution,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Parsons was not just a serious and valuable seller of books and classical music, although it was certainly that. Its cafe has been a regular haunt of many of the most memorable identities in Wellington’s political and legal professions. Its walls could tell many stories.”

“Julian and Beatrice Parsons say they will close the door with a deep sense of satisfaction. I wish them well for what lies ahead and thank them for the shop’s contribution to Wellington life over many years.”
