Health Minister Tony Ryall and Education Minister Hekia Parata have today launched a new guide designed to help deliver better health services for secondary school students.

“Evidence shows quality school health services improve student wellbeing – which leads to better learning and helps young New Zealanders reach their full potential,” says Mr Ryall.

“The new Youth Health Care in Secondary Schools framework is a practical guide to assist those planning, funding or providing primary health care services in secondary schools.”

Ms Parata says the Ministries of Health, Education and Social Development have worked together with non-government agencies and young people to develop the guide.

“This is a great example of the whole of government approach, which is driving real change in how departments work together to generate the best collective outcome for students, parents and communities.”

The Principal of Otahuhu College, Neil Watson, says their school’s health centre has provided students with access to care and advice that they could otherwise have missed out on.

“Having this service at the school removes the barriers some students face when it comes to accessing health care, such as cost or transport difficulties.

“The students themselves have been really engaged in positive health initiatives, with the Student Health Council helping promote programmes around healthy eating, blood donation, and hand washing.”

Through the Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health Project, school-based health services have been extended to decile 3 secondary schools. By the middle of this year around 55,000 secondary school students will have access to school based health services.
