Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges leaves tonight for Norway, the United States and Canada to meet ministerial counterparts and industry experts.

Discussions will focus on the latest developments in petroleum regulatory systems for health and safety and the environment, as well as issues and challenges facing the global energy market.

Mr Bridges will also be promoting New Zealand as an energy exploration and production destination and fostering bilateral energy relationships with key partners.

“With the fourth largest EEZ in the world, New Zealand is an excellent destination to promote,” Mr Bridges says.

“Changes to the Crown Minerals Act last year and the introduction of new legislation governing activities in the EEZ means we’ve got world-leading regulation, which is attractive to responsible operators.”

In Norway, Mr Bridges will be meeting with Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Tord Lien, and Trade and Industry Minister, Monica Maeland, as well as a range of petroleum industry and regulatory leaders.

In the United States, he will meet Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, and other senior officials in Washington, before heading to Houston.

Minister Bridges will attend the annual Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference, one of the biggest events on the international minerals exploration calendar.

“This will be a good opportunity to promote New Zealand and show them what we’ve got to offer,” Mr Bridges says.

“In particular, I’ll be encouraging companies to take a closer look at our Platinum NZ 2013 minerals tender, involving a competitive tender for metallic mineral exploration permits over five separate areas located in the Southland, West Coast, Tasman and Nelson-Marlborough regions of the South Island.”

In Canada, the Minister will also meet with Canadian Minister of Natural Resources, Joe Oliver, and Industry Minister, James Moore.
