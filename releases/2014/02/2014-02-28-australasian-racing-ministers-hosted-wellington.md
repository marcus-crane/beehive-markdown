Racing Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed Ministers from Australian states to the 2014 Australasian Racing Ministers conference in Wellington today.

“This is the first time this annual event has been held in New Zealand since 2005. It’s a great opportunity to discuss common issues and challenges facing the racing industry in both our countries,” Mr Guy says.

Ministers discussed the issues of off-shore wagering and animal welfare, along with presentations from the New Zealand Racing Board and the Ministry for Primary Industries.

Mr Guy also announced the appointment of Barry Brown to the New Zealand Racing Board’s governing body.

Mr Brown was appointed following statutory consultation with the racing industry. 

“Mr Brown brings to the Board his senior corporate legal expertise, corporate governance experience and knowledge of the racing industry.

“This is an important role given that the racing industry makes a major contribution to the New Zealand economy, generating around $1.6 billion annually and around 17000 jobs.

“I also want to thank Liz Dawson who is standing down after six years of excellent service as a board member,” Mr Guy says.
