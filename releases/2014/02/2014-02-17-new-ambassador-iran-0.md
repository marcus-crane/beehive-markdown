Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named diplomat Eamonn O’Shaughnessy as New Zealand’s Ambassador to Iran.

“New Zealand has a longstanding trade relationship with Iran, with over $173 million in exports last year,” Mr McCully says.

“Mr O’Shaughnessy will be responsible for further developing New Zealand’s engagement with the new government of President Rohani.

“The recent agreement with the international community over Iran’s nuclear programme is the most positive development in nearly 10 years of nuclear talks. A future comprehensive deal will only serve to enhance Iran’s international relationships, including with New Zealand.”

Mr O’Shaughnessy, who will also be accredited to Pakistan, has previously served in Kabul, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran.
