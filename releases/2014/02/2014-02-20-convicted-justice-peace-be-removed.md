Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows has today indicated that he will be recommending that the Governor General remove Justice of the Peace Daljit Singh from office, following his conviction in the Auckland High Court for electoral fraud.

“Justices of the Peace hold a respected and trusted position in our community, they know when they take on the role they will be required to hold themselves to the highest standard,” says Mr Borrows.

“When a JP fails to meet this high standard, as Mr Singh’s conviction clearly shows he has, other JPs and the public expect and deserve a firm response.”

Mr Borrows also noted the comments of Justice Woolford in sentencing Mr Singh, that the gravity of the offending was “moderately high”, and that he was “aware of the legal requirements” but acted “in a reckless and naïve manner.”

“I find this case especially troubling, in that Mr Singh has ignored the trusted place in our justice system he held and instead attempted to pervert the democratic process. To my mind there can be no excuse for such behaviour.

“Under these circumstances it is clearly impossible for him to continue to be a Justice of the Peace,” says Mr Borrows

Mr Borrows will tender advice to the Governor General under section 5 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1957 immediately. The removal from office will then be noted in the New Zealand Gazette.
