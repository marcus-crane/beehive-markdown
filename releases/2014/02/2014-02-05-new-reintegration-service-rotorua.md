Corrections Minister Anne Tolley says a new reintegration service in the Rotorua district will help reduce reoffending by providing post-release support for prisoners so they can stay crime-free.

Starting this month, Healthcare of New Zealand will work with up to 45 prisoners each year who are being released on conditions or on parole in Rotorua, Tokoroa and Taupo, and who would previously have had no access to support.

Each offender will be supported for six months, with the provider managing their transition back into the community by helping them to find sustainable accommodation and employment, while reconnecting them with families and whanau.

The service will also work with the prisoner while inside the wire, and provide accommodation for up to twelve weeks immediately after release if needed, with strict rules around behaviour.

“The days and weeks straight after release from prison are a challenging time, and we don’t want offenders returning to crime and creating more victims because they haven’t been able to access services or find accommodation,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This new service will make the transition back into normal life less difficult for offenders. We know that if they have a place to stay, alongside employment and stable relationships then they are less likely to commit more crimes.

“The offenders will also still be managed by probation officers, who will ensure that they fulfil any release conditions.”

The new service will cost up to $8,250 per offender depending on the level of support required, and will include prisoners who are not eligible for the recently announced Out of Gate reintegration programme, as their sentences have been for longer than two years.
