Police Minister Anne Tolley has announced the appointment of current Deputy Commissioner Operations, Mike Bush MNZM, as the next Commissioner of Police.

Mr Bush, who has a wide range of operational experience both in New Zealand and overseas, has been appointed for a three-year term which commences on 3 April 2014.

Mr Bush has been Deputy Commissioner Operations since April 2011, and through Prevention First and Policing Excellence has managed a change programme in Police which has contributed to a 17.4 per cent drop in recorded crimes over the past three years.

He has held challenging roles in rural, provincial and urban areas, and as District Commander in Counties Manukau he pioneered the implementation of Neighbourhood Policing Teams, which have successfully been introduced across the country.

Mr Bush was responsible for planning and operations for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and also led the rollout of smartphones and tablets for frontline staff which has contributed to an additional half a million frontline crime prevention hours each year.

As Police Liaison Officer for South East Asia, Mr Bush was the first New Zealand official to reach Phuket following the devastating 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, and was awarded the MNZM for his work during the operation.

The Governor-General has made the appointment of Mr Bush as Commissioner of Police on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

“I believe Mike Bush will be an outstanding Commissioner of Police, and will build on the excellent work of the current Commissioner, Peter Marshall,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We already have a very good working relationship, and the challenge is to continue to improve our well-respected and modern Police service, to ensure it delivers the safe communities the New Zealand public expect and deserve.

“Mr Bush has devoted 35 years of his life to serving the public with the New Zealand Police, and I congratulate him on his appointment.”
