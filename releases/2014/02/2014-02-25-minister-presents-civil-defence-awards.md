Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today presented the second round of Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) gold and silver awards at an event at Parliament.

“Recipients of these awards deserve recognition at the national level,” Ms Kaye says.

“Through their efforts they have made a vital contribution to our wellbeing as a nation and they are the backbone of New Zealand communities when there is a crisis.

“They have been there to serve their communities with practical assistance at times of great need. I am delighted to present these gold and silver awards.”

**Gold awards**

**Orion New Zealand Limited**, which owns and operates the electricity distribution network covering central Canterbury. Orion has set the benchmark for resilience for all providers and operators of lifeline utilities in New Zealand. Strengthened sub-stations, resilient communications and network information systems, a well led and highly motivated work team, and planned staff supplementation enable Orion to quickly understand impacts and outages. The 2010-11 Canterbury earthquakes and the strong winds and snow of 2013 proved the value of Orion’s investment to Canterbury’s communities and businesses, and to New Zealand’s economy.

**Simon Markham**, Recovery Manager for the Waimakariri District Council. Following the earthquakes of 2010-11, Simon delivered a resoundingly successful community-focussed recovery operation that has been recognised in Waimakariri, Canterbury, nationally and increasingly, internationally. Simon shouldered the responsibility without hesitation. He devised the recovery plan and oversaw its implementation. His brilliant thinking, tenacity, leadership, quiet confidence and co-operative spirit produced a recovery plan focussed singularly on the well-being of the people. His work has greatly assisted the physical rebuild of Waimakariri communities and also their morale, confidence and psychological well-being.

**Silver awards**

**Jennifer Rowan**, recent Chair of the Wellington CDEM Group and Mayor of Kapiti, for her outstanding public leadership and significant personal courage in advocating for reform in the Wellington CDEM Group.

**Jim Frater,** Nelson-Tasman CDEM Group Controller, for his outstanding leadership and ability as a controller in managing numerous responses.

**Basil Morrison**, Chair of Local Government Commission, for outstanding leadership in the Waikato region at times of crisis, and many years’ service as a local controller and elected official.

**Kim Manahi**, Emergency Preparedness Co-ordinator for the Ngai Tahu Runaka, for outstanding initiative and commitment to helping local communities be better prepared for a civil defence emergency, and ensuring marae are well-prepared to look after whanau, the community, response workers, and manuhiri that might need assistance in an emergency.

**Jonathan Davies**, Gisborne CDEM Group Controller, through outstanding leadership and management has developed strong and collaborative relationships with response partners, emergency services, and local businesses that have significantly enhanced CDEM in the Gisborne District.
