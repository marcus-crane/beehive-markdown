Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will host his Canadian counterpart, Foreign Minister John Baird, in Wellington today.

“Canada is one of our oldest and most established friends and partners. We have worked closely together on a wide range of issues for many years,” Mr McCully says.

“This visit comes as Canada looks to further strengthen its diplomatic connections with the Asia Pacific region, making it an excellent opportunity to discuss expanding our bilateral and regional cooperation.

“We always welcome an opportunity to discuss international issues with a bedrock partner such as Canada.”

Mr Baird will also meet a number of other ministers and attend Parliament’s question time.
