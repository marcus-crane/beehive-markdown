A Bill to update the funding of international traveller processing services at the border has passed its third and final reading in Parliament tonight.

Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says the Airports (Cost Recovery for Processing of International Travellers) Bill completes the funding arrangements agreed with the aviation industry back in 2004.

“Under the current funding model, new international airports create a funding shortfall for the Government’s border agencies when they begin service. This places pressure on the delivery of existing services by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), Customs and the Aviation Security Service.

“The Bill introduces cost recovery for these new services, which means that international airports, or requestors of non-routine services, will have to factor the border agencies costs into any future business decisions.

“The Bill provides for regulations to be made before charging can begin for any new or restarting international airports. There will be consultation on the regulations, including a likely two year cost recovery period, and the actual rates or methods of cost recovery at new or restarting airports.

“Protecting our borders from biosecurity threats is my number one priority as Minister, and this is an important step in ensuring we get the best value for taxpayers money.

“We have a world class, multi-layered biosecurity system with measures in place offshore and at the border to protect New Zealand. The passing of this legislation is another important improvement,” says Mr Guy.
