Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is encouraging people to get involved in their local Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS).

“COGS is a government-funded community-driven scheme to support community groups with a total of $12.5 million to distribute throughout New Zealand.

“The members of New Zealand’s 37 local distribution committees assess funding applications and decide which non-profit community organisation will receive a grant,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Early on in my career I served my community as Chair of the Aoraki COGS, so I have first-hand experience of both the opportunities and challenges these committees face.

“Being on a distribution committee is a unique opportunity to make a valuable contribution to your community and to help influence its development,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Candidates for each distribution committee need to be nominated by a non-profit organisation, based in the same geographic region as the committee.

Organisations can then vote in the election. Those which applied for a grant in 2013 will already be on the COGS electoral roll, but other organisations can apply to participate in the election.

Nominations close on March 14 and ballot forms are sent out on March 21. Voting closes on May 2.
