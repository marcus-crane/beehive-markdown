Online Government services are proving popular with Kiwi families Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"By December, an average of 43.3% of measured government service transactions were happening online, up from 29 per cent in June 2012. New Zealanders are increasingly choosing to use Government services digitally.”

“The Government wants to improve New Zealanders’ ability to complete their transactions with government easily  and where possible, online. It is measuring this through Better Public Services by aiming for an average of 70 per cent of New Zealanders’ most common transactions with government to be completed in a digital environment by 2017”, says Mr Dunne.

The target is measured through ten key government services provided online including applying for a passport, filing an individual tax return, applying for Ministry of Social Development financial assistance, paying for vehicle licenses and applying for overseas visas.

“Good progress is being made but there is more work to do to ensure we integrate more Government services online. New Zealanders expect to be able to access more and more services from devices such as smart phones and iPads”, says Mr Dunne.

**Background**

- Progress in government digital transactions is driven by Better Public Services Result 10,
- a government programme handled by the Department of Internal Affairs, and supporting

work being done across government agencies.

- Result 10 exists because one of the Government’s four priorities is the delivery of better

public services within tight fiscal constraints.

- Two results fall under the result area ‘improving interactions with government’: Result 10

focuses on interactions between government and individual New Zealanders, while Result 9 focuses on interactions between government and business.
