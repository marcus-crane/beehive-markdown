Minister for Whanau Ora Tariana Turia has congratulated the Taumarunui Community Kokiri Trust for its delivery of Whanau Ora initiatives. The Taumarunui Community Kokiri Trust has just celebrated 25 years of service to the community. The organisation has been operating since 1989 delivering a range of services with a focus on the holistic development and wellbeing of whanau, hapu and iwi including an early childhood centre, smoking cessation, aged care, mental health and tamariki ora.

“The Trust has always had the people’s interests at the forefront of its programmes and services. Their philosophy to improve the wellbeing of whanau underpins everything they do. They have consistently empowered their people through an approach that allows the people to have their own aspirations, to take control of their own lives and make decisions on their own health and well-being which also recognises who they are and where they have come from. This is at the very heart of Whanau Ora,” says Minister Turia.

“The Trust, its staff and its services recognise that strength comes with unity and working together. Taumarunui is based in the rohe of Hinengakau, an ancestor of the Whanganui river region. Those that descend from her are described in the metaphor Te Taura Whiri a Hinengakau – the many strands of Hinengakau. The taura whiri is a powerful metaphor. It conveys the idea of diversity, unity and collective strength – where the people and their culture are inseparable. The whanau and hapu are bound together by ties of blood, ties that are recognised and recorded in our traditions. The Trust is an excellent example of an organisation that recognises the benefits of collective strength and unity within whanau, hapu and iwi.”
