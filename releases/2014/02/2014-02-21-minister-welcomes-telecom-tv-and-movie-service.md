Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has welcomed news that Telecom will launch a new internet-delivered television and movie service.

“This is one of the early signs that the market understands the new opportunities that will be available under the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative,” Ms Adams says.

“The announcement from Telecom, which is changing its name to Spark, is an example of the sort of innovate approach I expect to see as UFB is rolled out around the country.

“These are exciting times as New Zealand’s enhanced connectivity through UFB, the Rural Broadband Initiative and fourth-generation mobile technology changes and challenges existing approaches. It brings considerable opportunities for new offerings in many areas.”

Ms Adams says it falls on industry to take the lead in some areas, including developing and promoting new services to business and consumers.

“The Government is playing an important role in the roll-out of faster broadband but we cannot, and should not, be dictating how use evolves.

“The market is evolving rapidly and throwing up exciting challenges. Those who grab them early are likely to flourish.”
