Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has announced that from today, the Ministry of Youth Development will be accepting applications from city and district councils to the Youth Development Partnership Fund.

There is a total of $889,000 for allocation with between $10,000 and $70,000 available per project.

“The point of this fund is get young people involved in and leading projects that are meaningful to them and their communities,” Ms Kaye says.

“It enables young people to develop leadership skills, volunteer in their community, and celebrate the great things that many of them are doing.”

An example of a successful project is the Clutha District Council that received $15,000 in 2013 to develop and build the skills of Clutha District youth so they can lead community projects and events.

“There are over 800,000 12 to 24 year olds in New Zealand and it is important their communities give them opportunities to have a say and be involved,” Ms Kaye says.

Since the launch of the Youth Development Partnership Fund in 2005, 59 city and district councils have been supported to work with young people. 

Applications close midday on Friday 4 April 2014.
