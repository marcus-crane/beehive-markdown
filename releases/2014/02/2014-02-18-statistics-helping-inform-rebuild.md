Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson say the release of further census information about Christchurch will provide much needed information for the rebuild.

Mr Brownlee says data released by Statistics New Zealand today shows just how much the region has changed following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

“The data shows the number of people working in central Christchurch city, within the four avenues, halved between 2006 and 2013. In 2013, 19,419 adults who lived in greater Christchurch worked within the four avenues, which was a decrease from 39,213 people in 2006.

“The areas with the biggest increases in the number of people working were Middleton, Yaldhurst, Riccarton South, Addington, Islington, Russley, Hornby North and Avonhead West.

“This sort of specific data will help aid and inform the rebuild in greater Christchurch,” Gerry Brownlee says.

Mr Williamson says the release of data today highlights the importance of the census last year.

“The whole of New Zealand participated in the census, and this type of useful information is the payback for that effort.”

The information gathered in the 2013 census shows where people are living and working, the makeup of households, employment and industry insights, and also transport and home heating choices.

Further detailed census data will be released in the next 18 months.
