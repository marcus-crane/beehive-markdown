Auckland Crown Solicitor Simon John Eisdell Moore QC has been appointed a Judge of the High Court, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Justice Moore graduated with an LLB from Auckland University in 1980 and was employed as a law clerk at Meredith Connell in Auckland, becoming a Staff Solicitor in 1982. In 1985 he was admitted to the partnership of that firm, and has been Chairman of Partners since 2003.

In June 1994 Justice Moore was appointed Crown Solicitor for Auckland.

In March 2000 Justice Moore was appointed Public Prosecutor for Pitcairn Island by the British Government, and in 2004 was responsible for the prosecution of 12 men on the Island for historical sexual offending.

Justice Moore was appointed Senior Counsel in 2008, becoming Queen’s Counsel when the title was restored in 2012.

The new Judge will sit in Auckland.

Crown Law will shortly appoint a partner of Meredith Connell to act as interim Crown Solicitor.

Crown Law will continue with a previously planned review of the Auckland warrant. It will be an extensive review and is expected to take some months. On completion of the review the process for advertising and receiving applications for the warrant will commence.
