The Government is seeking feedback on draft regulations for the dumping of waste and the discharge of harmful substances under the EEZ Act, Environment Minister Amy Adams announced today.

“These activities already occur within New Zealand’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. They are currently regulated by Maritime New Zealand under the Maritime Transport Act 1994, but will be transferred to the Environmental Protection Authority when the new regulations come into force,” Ms Adams says.

The proposed regulations will cover discharges of harmful substances from offshore structures and from production facilities on board mineral mining ships, as well as the burial of human remains and the dumping of waste.

The release of the exposure draft of the proposed regulations follows consultation in August 2013. Submissions can be made until 5pm 19 March, 2014.

The exposure draft is accompanied by supporting information that explains more about the discharge and dumping activities and the proposed regulations.

The EEZ Act came into force on 28 June 2013 and provides a comprehensive approach to managing the environmental effects of activities in the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.

The Government will make final decisions on the classification after consideration of submissions and intends for the regulations to be in effect by June 2014.

Under the EEZ Act, activities may be classified as permitted, discretionary, non-notified discretionary, discretionary  or prohibited.

The exposure draft and information on how to make a submission is available at: [www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/oceans/current-work/index.html](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/oceans/current-work/index.html)
