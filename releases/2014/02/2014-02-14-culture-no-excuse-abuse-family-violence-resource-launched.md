Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has launched a new resource to help address family violence in ethnic communities.

The ‘Culture No Excuse for Abuse’ booklet has been produced by Auckland’s Shakti Community Council with help from the Ministry of Social Development’s ‘It’s Not OK’ family violence prevention campaign.

“This fantastic new resource is aimed at encouraging conversations within ethnic families and communities on how to recognise family violence in its many different forms and what to do about it,” said Mrs Bennett.

“When the ‘It’s Not OK’ campaign was launched some years ago, many New Zealanders became aware for the first time that family violence covers a whole range of behaviour and actions beyond hitting out at someone.

“The Shakti booklet will do the same for ethnic communities making it clear that while it is important communities and families nurture their own cultural identities, it is not okay to use culture as an excuse for violence within families.

“With more than 87,000 family violence investigations affecting 100,000 children a year, New Zealanders of all ethnicities need to take action and commit to keeping their loved ones safe and free from violence.

“I have no doubt this excellent new resource will help families to have some difficult but very important discussions on what is and isn’t okay in their homes,” said Mrs Bennett.
