Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today released the free Occupation Outlook 2014 mobile app that gives young people and their families instant and easy access to the latest career information.

“Making job prospects information easily accessible to students and their families will help them to make better informed career choices. This free app provides instant New Zealand-specific information on the likely incomes, qualification options and costs, and job prospects for 50 key occupations, compiled from the annual Occupation Outlook report," Mr Joyce says.

“The annual Occupation Outlook Report is designed to be one of the first places for young people and their families to look when making decisions on subject choices and future careers. It brings together the latest information from employers, industries, the education sector and labour market analysts.

“The Occupation Outlook App is remarkably easy to use on smartphones and tablets and is in line with the Government’s focus on delivering more innovative, user-friendly, public services.

“This year's Occupation Outlook shows strong demand across all skilled occupations. The really hot careers currently are in the construction sector, engineering, ICT, science, and the primary sector.”

The 50 occupations on the app are grouped under the industry pathways used in the Government’s Vocational Pathways programme: Construction and Infrastructure, Manufacturing and Technology, Primary Industries, Service Industries, Creative Industries, and Social and Community Services.

The app is available for unlimited downloads from App Store for iPhones and iPod touches, and Google Play store for Android devices.
