Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the establishment of a Taskforce that will free up schools to focus more on raising student achievement, and identify regulations that are obstructing this.

The Taskforce is part of the Government’s confidence and supply arrangement between the National and Act parties, who are working together to identify significant improvements in school performance.

The Taskforce on Regulations Affecting School Performance will investigate regulations that may distract or hinder schools from focusing on raising achievement for all young people.

“Last year we amended the Education Act to set out for the first time the statutory purpose of school boards, which is to do all in their power to raise achievement for all students. Research also shows that 71% of our secondary school principals reported a desire to spend more time on educational leadership,” Ms Parata says. 

“By establishing the Taskforce we are taking action to ensure Boards and school leaders can continue to focus on raising educational achievement for all students and not be stifled by low level compliance and regulations.”

The Taskforce members are:

- Murray Jack (Deloitte) – Chair
- Jill Corkin (Principal, Snells Beach School)
- Howard Fancy (former Secretary for Education)
- Janet Kelly (former President of NZSTA, extensive experience in school governance)
- Renee Wright (Te Tari Tautoko – Te Runanga Nui o Nga Kura Kaupapa Maori o Aotearoa)
- Tim O’Connor (Principal, Auckland Grammar School)
- Warwick Maguire (Principal, Burnside High School)
- Prof Neil Quigley (Victoria University of Wellington)

“This Taskforce will bring together some of New Zealand’s foremost education practitioners on regulation, governance, and education. It is my expectation that the Taskforce will recommend changes to existing practices, rules and regulations in order to raise student achievement,” Ms Parata says.

The independent Taskforce will undertake a targeted consultation process starting in early 2014.

 “I am expecting a final report by 31 May 2014 identifying possible changes to rules, and regulations to achieve better education outcomes. The Taskforce will also identify areas of possible change that would benefit from further investigation,” Ms Parata says.

“My goal is to clear out any clutter and support schools to operate with flexibility and continue with their strong commitment to raising achievement for all students.

“This is an exciting piece of work for this Government as we continue our strong focus on helping five out of five young people to achieve their educational potential,” says Ms Parata.
