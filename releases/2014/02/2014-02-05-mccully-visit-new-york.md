Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will visit New York this week to host a Waitangi Day reception at New Zealand’s Permanent Mission and for a presentation of the African Union Handbook.

While in New York Mr McCully will hold meetings with a range of Permanent Representatives at the UN Headquarters.

“Securing a seat on the Security Council for 2015-16 is the government’s top foreign policy priority,” Mr McCully says.

“In the lead up to the election it is important to take opportunities in New York to outline our credentials as a fair-minded and independent small state.”

The African Union Handbook is a joint project by New Zealand and the AU Commission.

Modelled on New Zealand's United Nations Handbook, which is now in its 51st year, the African Union Handbook is the new official guide to the AU system.

Mr McCully will present the handbook to a meeting of the 54 African Permanent Representatives in New York. He formally launched the book last week in Addis Ababa with African Union foreign ministers.
