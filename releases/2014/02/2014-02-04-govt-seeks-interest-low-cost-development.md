Proposals are being sought for the development of about 275 affordable homes on an 11.5 hectare site in Hornby, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith announced today.

“We need to increase housing supply to assist with Christchurch’s recovery and we need more housing in the affordable range,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This proposal is about facilitating the private sector to develop land the Government owns to address Christchurch’s housing needs.”

The Invitation to Participate (ITP) invites housing developers, builders, iwi and community housing organisations for responses on how they could provide a mix of housing on the site.

“The Christchurch housing market is under real pressure with the loss of 15,000 houses from the earthquakes as well as the increased demand for housing from the rebuild workforce.  This initiative is about the Government using its land holdings to help increase supply,” Dr Smith says.

“This initiative is just part of the Government’s wide programme of work on addressing Christchurch’s post-earthquake housing challenge.  These include the Land Use Recovery Plan, the Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service (CETAS), the four temporary accommodation villages, the repair of 5000 Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) houses, the building of 700 new HNZC homes and five community housing developments, and the worker accommodation initiative in partnership with the private sector.

“The all-time record number of building consents issued in the fourth quarter of 2013 shows the momentum of the housing recovery work in Christchurch is gaining pace.  However, we still need to do more with initiatives such as this affordable housing project,” Dr Smith says.

The ITP will be released today on the Government’s electronic tender site (GETS).  Following receipt of submissions, there will be a competitive dialogue process with short-listed participants.  A preferred participant is expected to be identified by May 2014 with new housing to be available from 2015, subject to Cabinet approval.
