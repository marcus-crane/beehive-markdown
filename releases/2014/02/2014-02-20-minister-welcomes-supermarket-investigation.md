Commerce Minister Craig Foss has welcomed a Commerce Commission investigation into alleged anti-competitive conduct in the New Zealand supermarket sector.

“Concerning allegations have been made against a major New Zealand supermarket chain. Given the nature of these allegations I believe it is appropriate that the Commerce Commission formally investigates,” says Mr Foss.

“The Commission has assured me that anyone who has information relevant to the allegations can request that the Commission keep their identity and/or the information provided confidential.

The Commission will not disclose the identity and/or information unless consent is given or the Commission is required to by law.

“The Commerce Commission is the appropriate body to consider these allegations and I urge anyone with concerns around these allegations should contact the Commerce Commission immediately,” says Mr Foss.
