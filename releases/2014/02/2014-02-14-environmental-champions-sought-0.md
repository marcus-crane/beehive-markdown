Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced that entries are open for the Government’s premier environmental awards, which honour those dedicated to protecting and improving our environment.

The Green Ribbon Awards recognise outstanding contributions by individuals, organisations or businesses to addressing New Zealand’s environmental problems.

“There are so many people, communities and businesses who work hard to improve our environment in their own quiet way, but it is often without thanks,” Ms Adams says.

“The awards are a fitting occasion to show the human face of environmental issues, and promote the fantastic work that is happening in our communities.

“Having had the honour of hosting the awards for the last two years, it has been fantastic to meet so many people who are making a significant difference to our environment.

“We all know that environmental problems are not easy to solve. But with the combined dedication and outstanding contributions made by so many people in our communities, we can all be sure that we are on the right track.”

Ms Adams says nominations should show how work has provided significant environmental benefits, is innovative, goes the extra distance and has raised awareness of environmental issues.

The 12 award categories are:

- Protecting our biodiversity
- Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions
- Caring for our water
- Minimising our waste
- Protecting our oceans and coasts
- Communication and Education
- Community focus
- Stewardship champion
- Small business leadership
- Large business leadership
- Public sector leadership
- Green economy

Nominations for the awards, which are being held for the 24th year, close on 24 March.

Ms Adams will host the awards ceremony at Parliament on 16 June. The twelve category winners will be announced, before a Supreme Winner is revealed.
