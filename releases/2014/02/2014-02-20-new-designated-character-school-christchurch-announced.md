Associate Education Minister Hon Dr Pita Sharples today announced the establishment of a new Year 1-13 designated character school for Christchurch. The school, to be known as Te Pā o Rākaihautū, will have a designated character that offers a place-based curriculum for the 21st century founded on tikanga and Te Reo Māori, Te Ao Māori values, culture and history.

“This exciting new school will be the first of its kind in Christchurch. By bringing together Māori and English mediums in a pā setting, it will create a unique learning environment that will deliver significantly improved outcomes for Māori students,” Dr Pita Sharples said.

Te Pā will open for Term 1, 2015 for Year 1-10 students initially, before growing to Year 1-13 over the subsequent three years.

The new school will be located temporarily at the former Richmond School site, while the Ministry works with the Establishment Board of Trustees and whānau to locate a permanent site.

The Ministry of Education will now work to appoint the Establishment Board of Trustees for the new school. The members of the Board will have a range of skills and background knowledge, and reflect the needs and aspirations of the local community.

“I know there have been many whānau working to develop this school proposal, and I thank you for that. Now that Te Pā is coming into being, support for it will need to continue.”

“There are quite a few details to be finalised, but this is an exciting time for the greater Christchurch community. Te Pā’s unique approach to learning sets the school apart from other bilingual and immersion settings. This approach will contribute to the diversity of education in Christchurch and the development of the city as a leading education community in New Zealand.”
