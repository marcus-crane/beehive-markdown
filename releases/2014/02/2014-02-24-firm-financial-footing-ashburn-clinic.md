Health Minister Tony Ryall says an increase in funding for mental health services provided by Otago-based Ashburn Clinic should put it on a firm financial footing.

The government is providing Ashburn Clinic with an extra $1.1 million a year – bringing their annual Ministry of Health funding for the next financial year to nearly $4 million.

“Ashburn Clinic has been providing mental health services, including inpatient acute mental health beds, for over 130 years,” said Mr Ryall.

“Following concerns about the sustainability of the service, the Ministry of Health carried out a funding review of Ashburn Clinic last year.

“As a result of this review, Ashburn Clinic is receiving additional funding. The Ministry is also working with ACC on a new joint contract which is expected to be in place by midway through this year. This new contract will mean the future of this valuable service is secure.

“This is great news for the 60 or so staff who work at Ashburn Clinic, the clients and their families, as well as the wider community,” said Mr Ryall.

Ashburn Clinic provides a therapeutic community model of care, including modern psychiatric treatments and talking therapies. The Clinic also provides treatment for health professionals needing mental health or addiction services.
