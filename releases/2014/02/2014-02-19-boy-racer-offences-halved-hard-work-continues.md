Police Minister Anne Tolley says illegal street racing offences have reduced by 49.6 per cent in the last four years, contributing to safer roads, fewer deaths and injuries, and less anti-social behaviour in communities.

It follows the introduction in 2009 of legislation aimed at combating boy racer behaviour.

Illegal street racing offences dropped from 2,737 in 2009 to 1,380 in 2013. During the same period, road deaths for 15-24 year olds have fallen from 105 to 66.

“There are fewer boy racer offences throughout the country, and Police are firmly focused on reducing these numbers even further,” says Mrs Tolley.

“New Zealanders don’t want this dangerous and anti-social behaviour on our roads, or the deaths and injuries that result from it, and the message is getting through to boy racers that it won’t be tolerated.”

Of the total 10,141 offences since 2009 only 242 offenders are on their second strike, 13 drivers have received three convictions and three cars have been destroyed. Judges have the discretion to grant destruction orders on vehicles.

“The aim is not to crush cars but to have a strong deterrent, and the boy racer legislation is effective in letting these young drivers know that there are severe consequences if they continue to break the law.

“Fewer offences mean safer streets and fewer deaths and injuries, both to innocent drivers caught up in this behaviour, and to the boy racers themselves.

“There will be no let up from the Police.”

**Two new laws came into effect in 2009:**

The Sentencing (Vehicle Confiscation) Amendment Act which:

\* Allows vehicles to be seized and destroyed as a new penalty for illegal street racing

\* Allows vehicles repeatedly used by people with overdue traffic fines to be seized and sold to pay those fines

\* Enables Police and Courts to target illegal street racers who commit offences in another person's vehicle

And, the Land Transport (Enforcement Powers) Act which:

• Allows local authorities to create bylaws that prevent vehicles repeatedly “cruising” city streets

• Allows the compulsory impoundment of vehicles involved in illegal street racing

• Introduces demerit points for noise offences, licence breaches and registration plate offences.
