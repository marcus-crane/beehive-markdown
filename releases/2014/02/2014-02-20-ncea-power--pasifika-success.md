An expanded Pasifika initiative *Power Up for NCEA* 2014 has launched this week, following a successful introduction last year, to help Pasifika students with their NCEA study Education Minister Hekia Parata says.

The initiative, which focuses on developing Pasifika family education plans to help students and their families prepare and study for NCEA, is already beginning to show results in markedly raising achievement.

“Earlier this week, I announced that NCEA Level 2 achievement amongst Pasifika students in 2013 has risen to 71.8 per cent - that’s an increase of 7 percentage points since 2012, and 16.5 percentage points since 2008,” says Ms Parata.

“Research tells us that the two most important out-of-school factors that help young people to be successful at school are strong parent involvement and the expectations of their community.

“Power Up is a great example of parents, teachers and communities raising the expectation of success for their students - and working together to enable them to succeed.

“More than 1,700 students and family members signed up last year, and more than 200 family education plans were developed, which set out how each family will support their children’s educational success. I am delighted to see this successful programme back this year.” 

This week, the *Power Up* initiative opens its 2014 hubs, *Power Stations*, in Auckland and Wellington. The three week study choice programme will target NCEA students at Years 9 to 13 to help them make good choices in their subjects so that they will attain a good quality NCEA qualification. 

*Power Stations* will continue to be set up in churches, community centres and schools so there is even greater reach among Pasifika parents and students.
