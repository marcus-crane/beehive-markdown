Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, says the support for Pacific teams ahead of this weekend’s Wellington Sevens Rugby Tournament is sensational.

“The Wellington Sevens are about more than just sport. It is a chance for Pacific communities to come together and display their colour and culture on a world stage while supporting their island nations,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

Speaking to over 500 supporters at the welcome for the Manu Samoa Rugby Sevens side in Porirua this evening, Mr Lotu-Iiga said that the Pacific teams are always crowd favourites and top performers on the Wellington leg of the International Rugby Board (IRB) Sevens World Series Circuit.

“Fiji set the tone by winning the first ever Wellington Sevens tournament back in 2000. Since then Manu Samoa, Tonga, Niue and the Cook Islands have all brought the crowd to its feet over the years.

“These strong performances have been spurred on by support from their colourful fans and I cannot wait to see the Fijian, Tongan and Samoan supporters come out in force this weekend!”

Mr Lotu-Iiga said supporting Pacific languages and cultures was one of his priorities as Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and that the appearance of Pacific Island teams in the Wellington Sevens was an annual reminder of the importance of Pacific culture in New Zealand.
