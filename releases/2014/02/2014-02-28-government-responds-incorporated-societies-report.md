Commerce Minister Craig Foss today tabled in Parliament the Government’s response to the Law Commission’s report *A New Act for Incorporated Societies*.

“The Law Commission has produced a comprehensive report, outlining a number of recommendations to modernise the Incorporated Societies Act 1908.  The recommendations seek to improve guidance for people who run incorporated societies, including how to manage disputes.

“The Government has agreed to all but one of the 102 recommendations either in full or in principle,” says Mr Foss.

“A new Act based on the Commission’s recommendations will codify best practice for operating an incorporated society, as well as provide greater clarity and protection for members.

“While much of the detail in the Commission’s recommendations is yet to be fully tested, we will be seeking public comment on an exposure draft of the Bill and a model constitution in 2015,” says Mr Foss. 

The Law Commission has recommended that the new Act provides a mechanism for agricultural and pastoral societies to voluntarily transfer incorporation from the Agricultural and Pastoral Societies Act 1908 to the new Incorporated Societies Act.  The Government will make a decision on agricultural and pastoral legislation once consultation with stakeholders is complete.
