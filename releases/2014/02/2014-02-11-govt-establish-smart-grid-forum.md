Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today announced the establishment of a New Zealand Smart Grid Forum to advance the development of smart electricity networks in New Zealand.

“Emerging technologies will make different demands on the electricity systems of the future,” Mr Bridges says.

“Smarter electricity networks will be needed, capable of transferring energy between a more diverse range of generators and consumers, while balancing demand and supply.

“We need to ensure New Zealand is well placed to capture the benefits of solar energy, electric vehicles, and advanced meters, as well as developments in distribution automation, distributed storage, and demand response.”

The new Smart Grid Forum will provide a platform for dialogue between senior representatives from all parts of the electricity system, including consumers, as well as business, scientific and academic interests. 

Similar forums have already been set up in a number of other countries.

“The establishment of the forum reflects the Government’s commitment to the responsible and savvy use of resources and technology to secure New Zealand’s energy future, and lift our standard of living,” Mr Bridges says.

The forum is a joint initiative between the Electricity Networks Association and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

Applications to participate in the forum are now open and will close on 28 February 2014.  More information is on the Ministry’s website at [http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/energy/electricity/new-zealand-smart-grid-forum/view](http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/energy/electricity/new-zealand-smart-grid-forum/view)
