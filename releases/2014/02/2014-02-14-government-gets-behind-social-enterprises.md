Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced $1.27 million investment in the development of a solid support infrastructure for emerging social enterprises.

“Social enterprises are organisations with social or environmental goals which use commercial models to generate income,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This Government recognises that by combining social goals and business methods, social enterprise has the potential to play a significant role in New Zealand’s social innovation and economic development.

“The Government is partnering with the Hikurangi Foundation, a registered charity leading the way in supporting start-up social enterprises, to enhance support of social enterprises.

“Over the next two years the Hikurangi Foundation will receive $1.12 million to help build a national social enterprise incubation and development service to provide expert support, resources, and one-on-one advice from bases in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch,” says Mrs Goodhew.

In addition to this the Hikurangi Foundation will be provided a grant which will fund an accelerator pilot supporting 10 promising social enterprise initiatives.

The accelerator pilot will be funded in partnership with Contact Energy, who will be investing in the Hikurangi Foundation alongside the Government’s grant of $146,000.

“I welcome Contact Energy’s support. It is great to see private enterprises sharing their resources and expertise to support innovative initiatives,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Today I have also launched the Government’s position statement on social enterprise which signals a willingness to work collaboratively to create an enabling, supportive environment where enterprises can grow and attract investment.

“This is a new era within New Zealand’s community and voluntary sector and I look forward to discussions continuing between government agencies and social enterprise networks to identify ways this promising sector can grow.”
