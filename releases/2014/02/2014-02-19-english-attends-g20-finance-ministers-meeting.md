Finance Minister Bill English will join representatives from the world’s largest economies at the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Sydney this week.

Australia, as host of the G20 this year, has invited New Zealand to attend as a guest alongside the G20 members. The finance ministers will meet again in Cairns in September.

“New Zealand strongly supports Australia’s approach to the G20 presidency, including its focus on promoting strong economic growth and employment, and making the global economy more resilient to deal with future shocks,” Mr English says.

“Australian Prime Minister Abbott has also invited New Zealand to join the Australian Leadership Group of the Business 20, a forum that brings together business leaders from across the G20.

“Later this year, Australia will host an Australasian business week involving over 400 of the world’s top business leaders. Such significant opportunities do not come along often. We appreciate Australia providing this opportunity for New Zealand – both at a political and business level – to showcase our country at an important international forum.”

The finance ministers’ meeting, which runs from Friday through to Sunday, will discuss a range of issues including the global economy, investment and infrastructure, the challenge of managing growth, and taxation.

During his visit to Sydney, Mr English is hoping to hold bilateral meetings with United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty.
