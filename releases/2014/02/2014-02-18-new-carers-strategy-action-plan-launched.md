Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has today launched the Carers’ Strategy Action Plan for 2014 to 2018.

“Nearly half a million New Zealanders are providing care for someone close to them who needs help with everyday living because of a health condition or disability,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Often the word “carer” does not adequately reflect the diversity of those who take up the role, the special relationship they have with those they care for, and the sometimes tough circumstances in which they live.

“The Action Plan is to help improve the support for carers. The plan is the product of extensive consultation undertaken last year.

“As part of the consultation process focus groups were held with carers across the country and over 400 written submissions were received. Talks were also held with both the New Zealand Carers Alliance and health and disability sector groups,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This Government has taken on board the call from carers to give them a meaningful and practical Action Plan which does not take the ‘one size fits all’ approach.

As a result of the consultation, the Action Plan for 2014 to 2018 reflects that:

- A top priority for carers is being able to take a break when required
- Carers need support to balance their giving, paid-work and or studies
- A great variety of information and resources for carers

“I commend the Government agencies involved in the Action Plan (Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment), who have already started identifying priority actions which can be achieve this year,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The Carers’ Strategy Action Plan was first launched in 2008 and is renewed every five years to keep it focused and relevant for carers.”
