Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse has welcomed the appointment of the New Zealand Cycle Safety Panel, an expert group tasked with helping find practical ways to make cycling safer on New Zealand roads.

“New Zealand has seen a significant reduction in the number of serious car crashes in recent years. However, this trend has not been mirrored by similar improvements for cyclists,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The Government wants to encourage cycling as a transport option by making it easier and safer for people to cycle. The panel of experts brought together by the NZ Transport Agency are well placed to help us do just that.”

Membership of the New Zealand Cycle Safety Panel is as follows:

- Richard Leggat (Chair)
- Sarah Ulmer
- Professor Alistair Woodward
- Marilyn Northcotte
- Dr Glen Koorey
- Mike Noon
- Dr Hamish Mackie
- Simon Kennett
- Dr Alexandra Macmillan
- Axel Wilke

“There is a lot of experience and passion in the Panel’s membership. I wish them all the best for what is an important task and an exciting opportunity.

“As the Panel starts out, the government will continue its existing work to improve the safety of cyclists by investing in separated cycle paths, improving roading, identifying our highest-risk intersections and making them safer, and lowering the blood alcohol limit,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The NZTA convened the panel in response to a coronial review of cycling safety in New Zealand. It is expected to meet for the first time next month and aims to deliver its recommendations by the end of September.
