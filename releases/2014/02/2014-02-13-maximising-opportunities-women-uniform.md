Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s release of the Ministry of Defence’s review into the experiences of women in uniform in the NZDF.

“I asked the Ministry to conduct this review as it is important the NZDF is a place where women can develop a good career and achieve their full potential,” says Dr Coleman.

“The review shows the NZDF is making good progress, however more work is needed to recruit and retain more women in uniform, and to see them advance into senior roles.

“While the report confirms the NZDF has a higher proportion of women in uniform compared to Australia, the US, the UK and Canada, our numbers need to be higher.

“The report acknowledges the steps the NZDF has taken over time to modernise the workplace, such as introducing family-friendly policies and anti-harassment training.

“The NZDF is currently working on a number of new initiatives, including a tracking system for recruit training facilities focusing on discrimination, bullying and harassment.

“We have got to keep on sending the message that any form of discrimination, bullying or harassment in the military is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. It is important the NZDF is a workplace where all personnel feel comfortable to go about their duties.”

The review’s recommendations have been accepted by the NZDF. A detailed work programme is being developed and will be integrated into the NZDF’s wider personnel strategy.

The report ‘Maximising Opportunities for Military Women in the NZDF’ examined NZDF policies, information from NZDF surveys, international literature, as well as interviews with current and former NZDF personnel.

The Australian Human Rights Commission, who conducted the Broderick Review of the Australian Defence Force, found the review was a comprehensive report based on strong analysis of data and qualitative information. The report was also peer reviewed by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs.
