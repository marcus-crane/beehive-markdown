Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga announced today that statisticians from Pacific countries will spend time at Statistics New Zealand in an effort to grow their statistical knowledge and capability.

Four statisticians from Fiji, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru will work in Wellington from Monday for a month as part of a programme supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Maurice Williamson says statistics can be complex and open to interpretation. “This programme helps smaller national statistics offices ensure their people are well-supported."

Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says growing statistical knowledge across the Pacific region will be invaluable to governments, business leaders and communities. “This will help our Pacific neighbours make better decisions and improve planning for future growth and development."

The four statisticians will be working on specific projects such as census, consumers price index, and balance of payments.
