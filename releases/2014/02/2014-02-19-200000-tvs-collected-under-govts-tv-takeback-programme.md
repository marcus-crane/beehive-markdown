Environment Minister Amy Adams says more than 200,000 televisions have now been collected for recycling under the Government’s TV TakeBack programme.

The TV TakeBack programme aims to divert televisions from going to landfill in an initiative that involves the Government partnering with a range of councils, recyclers and retailers to provide a nationwide network of television recycling drop-off locations.

Ms Adams applauded those New Zealanders who have taken part in the TV TakeBack initiative across the country.

“The collection of 200,000 televisions represents a significant milestone for the programme. This means hundreds of tonnes of recyclable material has been kept out of landfills,” Ms Adams says.

“Due to the success of this programme, New Zealanders now know that old televisions need to be disposed of responsibly and are choosing to drop their unwanted sets at one of the TV TakeBack collection points.”

Ms Adams has also announced the winners of a competition to raise awareness among school students and their communities of the need to recycle televisions.

The Enviroschools Challenge was a joint initiative organised by the Ministry for the Environment and the Enviroschools Foundation, as part of the TV TakeBack programme.

Residents across the North Island were encouraged to take an unwanted television to a participating drop-off site and nominate an Enviroschool of their choice.

Orautoha School in Ohakune and Russell School in the Bay of Islands had the best participation rates, and each school has won a 46-inch LED Smart Television and a Home Theatre System**.**
