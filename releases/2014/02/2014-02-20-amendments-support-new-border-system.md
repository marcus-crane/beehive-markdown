Customs Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed the passing of the second reading of the Border Processing (Trade Single Window and Duties) Bill.

The Bill amends the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the Biosecurity Act 1993 to support the implementation of the Joint Border Management System.

“The new system is replacing existing Customs and Ministry for Primary Industries IT systems, integrating border clearance processes, and providing a single channel (the Trade Single Window) for importers and exporters to comply with New Zealand’s border requirements.

“This Bill supports the implementation of Trade Single Window and promotes consistency across customs and biosecurity legislation.

“The amendments cover registration of JBMS users, sending and receiving information to and from Trade Single Window, and consequential changes to offences and penalties," Mr Williamson says.

Changes to improve the effectiveness of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 are also provided for in the Bill.

"Trade Single Window will promote more effective protection of New Zealand’s borders and ensure a smoother flow of legitimate trade," Mr Williamson says.
