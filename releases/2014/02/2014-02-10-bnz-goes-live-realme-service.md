Minister of Internal Affairs Peter Dunne welcomed the announcement by the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) that it will go live with the *RealMe* service from mid-February, enabling new customers to prove their identity online.

“The BNZ is to be commended for adopting this innovative new service. *RealMe* is a core component of the Government’s drive to deliver better, faster online services.  It is good to see the banking sector adopting the technology to give their customers comprehensive online services,” says Mr Dunne.

“From mid-February, people with a *RealMe* verified account will be able to open a new account online with BNZ. There is no need to supply identity documents during the sign up process to prove who you are. You will be able to do it all online”.

Law changes in 2012 enabled approved private entities to use *RealMe*. The banking sector is leading the way in becoming early adopters. TSB Bank has already gone live with *RealMe*, Kiwibank has confirmed they will use *RealM*e and other large banks have given very strong commitments.

Banks can use *RealMe* to meet the requirements for electronic identity verification set out under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism legislation. RealMe enables proof of identity online to a high degree of confidence. It is the online equivalent of walking up to a counter and showing your passport. It also enables people to login to multiple online services securely with a single username and password.

“*RealMe* is another example of better public services making life easier for New Zealanders. It protects people’s privacy by not storing their information, instead it just passes it securely when people want to prove who they are. I look forward to more businesses signing up to this innovative service in the near future”, says Mr Dunne
