Crime and reoffending continues to fall according to the latest progress report on Better Public Service (BPS) to September 2013, Justice Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“Increased collaboration between the Ministry of Justice, Police, Corrections and Courts means the Justice sector is making excellent progress and is well on track to meet, and even exceed its targets by 2017,” Ms Collins says.

“Since June 2011, the total crime rate has fallen 13 per cent, the violent crime rate has fallen 9 per cent, the youth crime rate has fallen 22 per cent and the reoffending rate is down 11.4 per cent.

“Crime is at a 33 year low and we have the opportunity to keep doing what works and finding new and innovative ways to prevent crime from occurring in the first place.”

BPS targets for the justice sector are to reduce the total recorded crime rate by 15 per cent, the recorded violent crime rate by 20 per cent and the youth crime and re-offending rate by 25 per cent by 2017.

Ms Collins says the sector is also continuing efforts to strengthen support for victims of crime to make sure they remain at the heart of our justice system.

“We’ve embarked on a comprehensive programme of reform to protect communities, prevent crime, and put victims first, with levies on offenders, new laws, and new services for victims,” Ms Collins says.

“We’re staying tough on criminals, keeping record numbers of Police on the beat, and ensuring the justice system focuses on the rights of victims and is more accessible for those who need to use it.”

Today’s results show that in the year to September 2013, 51,553 fewer recorded crimes have been experienced by New Zealanders than in the year to June 2011.

Ms Collins acknowledges the Ministry of Justice, Police and Corrections and her Justice sector ministerial colleagues for their continued commitment to making New Zealand safe.
