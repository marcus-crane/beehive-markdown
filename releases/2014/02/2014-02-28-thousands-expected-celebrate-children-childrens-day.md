Social Development Minister Paula Bennett will be among tens of thousands of New Zealanders celebrating Children’s Day this weekend.

This Sunday marks the 14th annual Children’s Day, and around 150 events will be held around the country all weekend. 

“Children’s Day is a great time for families to have a bit of time out and fun together,” Mrs Bennett said.

Events being held include the South Waikato Community Collective in Tokoroa, with activities and competitions for children and teenagers, and an appearance by Waikato Chiefs rugby players.

Christchurch is holding a Children’s Day event at the Ferrymead Heritage Park with over 10,000 expected to attend.  

“All the exciting events lined up embody the Children’s Day theme of treasuring our children, with plenty of fun and colourful activities, games and performances for families to get involved in.” 

“The most important thing about Children’s Day is spending time with them, whether that’s at an event, an outing or at home.”  

“It’s a chance to celebrate the important place children have in all communities, and to focus on ways we can build stronger, more resilient families so children have the best opportunity to thrive.”

Children’s Day is also a time for New Zealanders to pause and think about those children who don’t receive the love and support they need to grow up healthy and happy.

The Children’s Action Plan contains more than 30 initiatives, each aimed at protecting and nurturing vulnerable children, and preventing abuse and neglect.

That includes Children’s Teams, with two already working in Whangarei and Rotorua, and the changes introduced in the Vulnerable Children Bill, which is currently at Select Committee.

“This Government is firmly invested in supporting vulnerable children, and we’re working right alongside communities to make a difference in their lives,” Mrs Bennett said. 

“There are over 12,000 fewer children living in benefit-dependent homes compared to 2012, which means a much brighter future for them and their families.”

“Children’s Day is a fantastic opportunity to come together and celebrate the biggest treasure in our lives – our children.”
