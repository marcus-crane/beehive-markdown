A bill to improve New Zealand’s electoral law has passed its second reading in Parliament today.

Justice Minister Judith Collins says the Electoral Amendment Bill implements changes following the latest parliamentary select committee review, routinely carried out after each general election.

“The changes made by this Bill will help maintain the high integrity of New Zealand’s electoral system and improve services to voters, candidates and parties,” Ms Collins says.

Measures in the Bill include:

- allowing people to enrol and update their details fully online using the RealMe service;

<!--THE END-->

- making loans to parties subject to disclosure rules, similar to laws that already apply to donations; and

<!--THE END-->

- allowing parties to lodge bulk candidate nomination and party list documents by email.

The Bill incorporates a number of amendments made by the Justice and Electoral Select Committee. These include preserving the existing rules around electioneering on polling day, and the use and purpose of EasyVote cards.

It is expected the Bill will progress though its final Parliamentary stages in the next few months so the changes can be implemented in time for the general election later this year.
