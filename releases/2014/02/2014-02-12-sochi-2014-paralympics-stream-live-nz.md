Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss has welcomed an announcement that Attitude Pictures has been awarded the online broadcast rights for the Sochi 2014 Paralympic Winter Games.

Attitude Pictures is collaborating with NZ On Air, ACC and TVNZ to make coverage of the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games possible.

“I am delighted that New Zealanders will be able to watch our Paralympic athletes on either TVNZ or AttitudeLive.com.

“The traditional broadcasting model is rapidly changing and this is a great example of digital convergence with more than one free-to-view distribution model operating at the same time.

“I met with representatives of Attitude Pictures late last year to discuss their desire to get the broadcast rights and I am pleased they have been able to gain the support of Government agencies and TVNZ to make this happen,” says Mr Foss.

The Sochi 2014 Paralympic Winter Games will be held from 7-16 March. Attitude Pictures will present New Zealand audiences with 44 hours of coverage and highlight packages.
