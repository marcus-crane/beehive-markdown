Health Minister Tony Ryall says fruit suppliers across the country are gearing up for the start of the school year and the delivery of nearly half a million pieces of fresh fruit to schools next week.

“Over 96,000 primary and intermediate school children in 473 schools will eat more than 18 million pieces of free fruit this year,” says Mr Ryall.

“The first pieces of fruit, including apples, bananas and peaches, will be delivered to schools on Monday – when all schools are back.

“Through the Fruit in Schools programme, high needs primary and intermediate schools receive two deliveries of seasonal produce each week. Over the year, children eat up to 33 different types of fruit and vegetables.

“Schools tell us the programme is improving the health of children – fewer children are suffering from school sores and dental health has improved.

“This government extended the Fruit in Schools programme four years ago and reduced administration costs at the same time.

“More children than ever before are getting a healthy piece of fruit each day at school,” says Mr Ryall.
