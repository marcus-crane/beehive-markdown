Prime Minister John Key has expressed his deepest sympathies to those affected by this morning’s events in Canada.

“The reasons behind the fatal shooting in Ottawa this morning are not yet known, but it is clearly a senseless act of violence,” says John Key.

“I wish to extend New Zealand’s sincere condolences to the people of Canada who will be shaken by this violent act.”

“I will personally extend those thoughts and wishes to Prime Minister Harper.

“New Zealand and Canada have a long standing warm and close relationship and today we stand beside them in solidarity.”
