Senator David Johnston and his New Zealand counterpart Gerry Brownlee met in Perth today for the annual Australia-New Zealand Defence Ministers’ Meeting.

Both Ministers were pleased to have the opportunity to meet in advance of the opening Centenary of ANZAC event at Albany on 1 November.

The next four years of Centenary of ANZAC commemorations will demonstrate that the Australia-New Zealand defence relationship, forged on the battlefields, remains strong 100 years after the start of World War I.

During this year’s meeting, Ministers affirmed the enduring strength of the defence partnership.  Both countries remain committed to the relationship and look forward to further opportunities to deepen the already close cooperation between our two Defence Forces.

Ministers shared perspectives on important global and regional security issues, including recent developments in Iraq.  Ministers agreed to continue to share assessments of the situation and the international response.

Ministers affirmed Australia and New Zealand would continue to work together to support capacity building across the Pacific including military training exercises, humanitarian and disaster relief, building projects and fisheries surveillance.

Ministers emphasised the continued importance of deepening practical cooperation and interoperability between our two militaries, particularly as new higher-end capabilities are brought online.  New Zealand’s full participation in Exercise Talisman Sabre and Australia’s participation in New Zealand’s Exercise Southern Katipo (both in 2015) will provide opportunities to further develop this practical cooperation.

Australia thanked New Zealand for its contribution of a P3-Orion surveillance aircraft in support of the search efforts for flight MH370.  The seamless integration of the aircraft into the operation demonstrated the strength of the operational relationship between our two Defence Forces.
