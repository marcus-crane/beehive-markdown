Money Week offers a great opportunity for Kiwis to improve their financial knowledge, says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

“Improving financial knowledge is a key focus this week. It is important that we all think about our personal finances so we can make good decisions in the short and long term,” Mr Goldsmith says.

Money Week is a nationwide week of events which runs between13 to 19 October and is organised by the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income.

The theme of Money Week 2014 is ‘Get your money fighting fit’. More than 200 events are taking place around New Zealand to raise awareness.

“It’s great to see so many schools, community groups and workplaces getting behind Money Week. Across the country Kiwis are organising events that encourage people to take a closer look at their financial situation,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Some of the topics being discussed include how to better manage our money, day-to-day budgeting, and long term financial planning.

“I encourage everyone who wants to improve their level of financial literacy to get involved in the events happening around the country this week,” says Mr Goldsmith.
