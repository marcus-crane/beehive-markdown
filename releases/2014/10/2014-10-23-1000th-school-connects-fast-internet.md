The rollout of fast internet to schools continues to exceed expectations with the connection by Network for Learning (N4L) of the 1000th school to the Government’s Managed Network, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“I am delighted to be able to today visit Stanley Avenue School in the Waikato town of Te Aroha, the 1000th school to be connected. This means that 40 per cent of New Zealand schools are now connected to the Managed Network.

“Having schools connected to the Managed Network is part of our commitment to ensuring our young people are equipped with the skills and education they need to be successful in employment and in life, no matter where they are in New Zealand.

“Providing high-quality, high-speed internet will help ensure that every student can benefit from technology to achieve their best.”

The Government is investing $211 million in the Managed Network, which will provide quick and reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering and network security services for all New Zealand schools wishing to participate.

“More than 290,000 students and 20,000 teachers are now using a Government-funded internet connection running at reliably high speeds,” Ms Kaye says.

“Meeting the needs of 21st-century students is a priority for this Government.  Ensuring our children are learning in modern and digitally-connected classrooms is critical in enabling schools to explore more innovative approaches to teaching and learning, using the internet and digital technologies.”

N4L is on track to connect all participating schools to the Managed Network by the end of 2016.

*Editor's notes:*

**What is the N4L Managed Network?**

The Managed Network connects schools via a secure data network, offering higher levels of service quality and support than has been previously available. It will provide schools with fast access to the internet and more reliable connections.

The Managed Network operates over the best mix of ultra-fast, rural and remote broadband available in New Zealand. It is centrally managed; schools will no longer need to support their own internet connection, which will help reduce ICT complexity and costs.

**How many more schools will be connected in 2014?**

N4L aims to connect another 100-200 schools this year.

**Stanley Avenue School**

Stanley Avenue School is a decile 5 primary school in the Coromandel. It has 277-pupils. The school has a student-run television and radio station.
