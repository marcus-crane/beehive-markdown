Social Development Minister Anne Tolley today announced that Jo-anne Wilkinson has been appointed as interim Families Commissioner and Chair of the Families Commission Board.

“I’m delighted that Ms Wilkinson has agreed to take on the role while we look for a permanent appointment. 

“As co-founder and former Chief Executive of the Foundation for Youth Development (previously known as the Project K Trust), Ms Wilkinson brings a wealth of experience of the youth and NGO sectors.

“The Families Commission is in good hands with strong leadership as the search begins for a permanent appointment,” says Mrs Tolley.

Mrs Tolley also publicly thanked outgoing Families Commissioner Belinda Milnes for her contribution to the work of the Commission.
