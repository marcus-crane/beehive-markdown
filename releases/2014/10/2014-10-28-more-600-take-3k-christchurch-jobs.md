Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the Government’s 3K to Christchurch scheme is a winner with 633 unemployed people taking up the offer.

“Since the scheme began in July a total of 523 men and 110 women have received the $3,000 payment as an incentive to move off benefit to Christchurch for a fulltime job.  204 of these are aged between 16 and 24 years.

“It is transforming lives.  A Northland father in his 40s who has been on benefit since 2007 has been working in asbestos removal since July and has since been promoted to Supervisor.  He loves the work and the money.  While he’s missing his family, his employer is paying for him to fly home for weekends because he has become so crucial to the business.

“A 23 year old man who had been unemployed since May has impressed an employer so much that he has been offered an Air Conditioning apprenticeship.

“Unsurprisingly the greatest take-up has been in the construction sector with 350 positions, followed by transport, warehousing and manufacturing. 

“The Government is currently exploring extending the scheme beyond Christchurch to other parts of the country with high labour demands and low unemployment.

“It is fantastic that 3K to Christchurch is playing a vital part in attracting people to help with the rebuilding of the city, says Mrs Tolley.
