Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that Shane Jones will serve as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Nauru, Mauritius and the Seychelles in addition to his role as Pacific Economic Development Ambassador.

“This week Mr Jones presented his credentials to the South Pacific’s smallest state, Nauru, and he will be officially accredited to Mauritius and the Seychelles in the coming months,” Mr McCully says.

“These appointments will complement his role as Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development and ensure he is able to hear directly from the leaders of small island developing states.

“An important part of his role will be helping to foster greater cooperation between the Pacific region and other regional groupings of island states. This is reflected in his appointments as High Commissioner. 

“Mr Jones will represent New Zealand as a partner who will support small island developing states on the international stage and provide practical advice on development assistance,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Jones will continue to be based in New Zealand.
