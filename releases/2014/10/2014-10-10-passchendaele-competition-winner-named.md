Veterans' Affairs Minister Craig Foss today announced the winner of the 2014 Battle of Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition as 17-year-old Siobhan Lenehan from Carmel College in Auckland.

Sara Stern from Middleton Grange School in Christchurch and Micaela Meder from Pakuranga College in Auckland were named equal runners-up.

The competition was launched in 2011 to ensure New Zealand’s sacrifice on the Western Front is not forgotten.

"Siobhan’s essay, History Uncovered! – Why We Don’t Remember Passchendaele, captures why this battle is such a significant piece of New Zealand history," Mr Foss says.

Mr Foss will present Siobhan with a $2000 education grant at a ceremony marking the 97th Anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele at the Auckland War Memorial Museum on Sunday.
