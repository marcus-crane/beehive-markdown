Local Government Minister Paula Bennett has today launched the Rules Reduction initiative, opening the way for people to submit examples of property regulations and local rules that don’t make sense.

“People can now head to [www.govt.nz/rulesreduction](http://www.govt.nz/rulesreduction), to start telling us what bugs them when it comes to loopy rules and regulations,” says Mrs Bennett. 

“I’m also pleased to announce the Rules Reduction Taskforce will be jointly chaired by Jacqui Dean MP, Parliamentary Private Secretary for Local Government, and Michael Barnett ONZM, Chief Executive of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce.

“Both Jacqui and Michael bring with them a strong understanding of the local government and business sectors and will be well placed to guide the Taskforce in its work to cut red tape.

The remaining members of the Taskforce will be appointed within the next month, and will include central and local government experts, and specialists from the building and trades sector, with further announcements to come on the timeline for the Taskforce’s work.

“I’m asking property owners, builders, tradespeople and businesses who have experienced the issues caused by irrelevant or unnecessary regulations, to help draw these to our attention,” says Mrs Bennett.

The information gathered will inform the Taskforce, which will consider submissions and ultimately recommend any necessary changes.

“Central and local government need regulations which are effective, and help get the job done – not get in the way. Regulations that frustrate property owners and business people also suck up councils’ precious resources in administration time and effort.”

“We need to hear from New Zealanders about examples that have got in the way of their building, renovation, landscaping, and home improvement plans, so that we can cut the red tape where it needs to be cut, to help them get on with the job.”  

The submission form can be filled out online at [www.govt.nz/rulesreduction](http://www.govt.nz/rulesreduction)

Facebook ([facebook.com/cutredtapenz](http://www.facebook.com/cutredtapenz)) and Twitter ([twitter.com/CutRedTapeNZ](https://twitter.com/CutRedTapeNZ)) will be used to spread the word and encourage submissions via the online form to the Taskforce.
