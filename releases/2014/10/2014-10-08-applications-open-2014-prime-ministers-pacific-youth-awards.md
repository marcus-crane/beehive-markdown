Applications for the 2014 Prime Minister's Pacific Youth Awards open today, offering the chance to highlight the success of young Pacific peoples in New Zealand.

The program is now in its sixth year and recognises the achievements and potential of our future Pacific leaders.

“Our Government recognises that the Pacific community is one of the largest and youngest populations in New Zealand.  Ensuring that our young people thrive is crucial for the entire economic and cultural outlook of New Zealand.

“The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards recognise and reward high-achieving young Pacific New Zealanders who have potential to contribute significantly to the future of our nation,” says Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

The five award categories are:

**Leadership & Inspiration - *Sponsored by the Ministry Pacific Island Affairs***

This award recognises a young person who has demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities by leading a project in their community, church or school or has acted in a way that has inspired others to make a positive change in their own life or the lives of others.

**Business & Enterprise - *Sponsored by Westpac & the Pacific Business Trust***

This award recognises a young person or group of young people who have demonstrated commercial acumen through a business or social enterprise activity.

**Arts & Creativity - *Sponsored by Creative New Zealand***

This award recognises a young person who has demonstrated a significant level of achievement in the arts or has used the arts to effect change in their community.

**Learning & Teaching - *Sponsored by Youthline***

This award recognises a young person for significant academic achievement and/or for helping other young people to succeed in education.

**Sports & Fitness - *Sponsored by NZIS***

This category recognises a young person or group of young people for extraordinary achievement in their chosen sport or for making an outstanding contribution to sports and fitness activities in their community.

In addition to these award categories, Leadership NZ has agreed to partner with the Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards by creating a tailored leadership development experience for each of the award winners during 2015.

“Our communities are full of innovative, inspiring and aspirational young Pacific people.  Their talents and gifts deserve to be acknowledged and I encourage them to apply for one of these awards,’’ says Mr Lotu-Iiga.
