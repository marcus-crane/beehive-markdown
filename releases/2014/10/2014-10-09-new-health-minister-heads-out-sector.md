Health Minister Jonathan Coleman is getting out of the Beehive to meet the health sector, starting with Southern District Health Board tomorrow.

“I will be visiting all 20 District Health Boards over the next few months to engage with doctors, nurses and management. As a doctor I know the value of clinicians in helping to drive progress in the health system,” says Dr Coleman.

“I want to engage with the sector to hear their views, and look at how we can make the best use of resources, people, facilities and funding. It is vital that patients are at the centre of our health system, and receive the healthcare they need.

“Visiting Southern District Health Board is my first priority. I want to hear about the issues first-hand from clinicians and management.

“The Government is focused on investing in primary care, screening, early intervention and disease prevention. We want to make progress on more elective surgery, faster cancer treatment, and shorter stays in emergency departments. We are also committed to investing $50 million over three years to reduce pain in bones, muscles and joints, and we plan to increase hospice funding by $20 million a year.

“As Minister for Sport and Recreation I am also looking to strengthen the link between exercise and keeping New Zealanders healthy. Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes.”

Dr Coleman’s visit to Southern District Health Board will include meetings with senior doctors and board members. He will also meet with primary care leaders and Otago University.
