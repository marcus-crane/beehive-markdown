Prime Minister John Key has welcomed New Zealand securing a place on the United Nations Security Council for the 2015-16 term.

“New Zealand’s success in gaining a place on the Security Council is a victory for the small states that make up over half the United Nations membership,” Mr Key says.

“We have worked very hard on the bid for close to a decade because we believe that New Zealand can make a positive difference to world affairs and provide a unique and independent voice at the world’s top table.

“It has been more than 20 years since New Zealand was last on the Council and we are ready to contribute again.

“It was a tough campaign against Spain and Turkey, two much bigger countries and close friends.

“I would also like to acknowledge all the hard work which has gone into our campaign from across the New Zealand Government and in particular from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“Our win proves small countries have a role to play at the UN and we are determined to represent the perspective of small states at the Security Council table.

“At the moment the Council faces a number of challenging issues. New Zealand is looking forward to serving on the Council and making a positive contribution throughout our two-year term,” Mr Key says.
