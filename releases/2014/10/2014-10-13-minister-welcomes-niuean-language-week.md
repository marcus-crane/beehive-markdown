Minister for Pacific Peoples, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraging New Zealanders to celebrate and participate in this week’s Niuean Language Week.

The theme this year is *Fakaako, Fakaaoga, Fakamau ki a Mauokafua e Vagahau Niue: Learn, Use, Retain, Maintain our Language Vagahau Niue.*

“This week is about finding opportunities to maintain and grow the recognition, learning and use of the Niuean language in our homes, work places and communities,” Mr Lotu-liga says.

“We have a small but passionate community of nearly 24,000 Niuean’s in New Zealand.  They recognise and understand the importance of safeguarding the Niuean language and culture for future generations.” 

“New Zealand is also blessed with the talents of many famous Niueans such as John Pule, international artist, poet and writer, and rugby figures such as Frank Bunce and Piri Weepu.”

Niuean Language Week runs from 13 to 19 October. A range of events will take place around the country involving traditional performances, language programmes and cultural cuisine.

“Celebrating and sharing our cultural identity is essential for the wellbeing of our children, families and the wider community.  There is an exciting program of events throughout the week. I encourage all New Zealanders to take part,” Mr Lotu-Iiga added.
