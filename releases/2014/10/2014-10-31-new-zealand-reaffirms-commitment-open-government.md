State Services Minister Paula Bennett is pleased to announce that today New Zealand formally became a member of the Open Government Partnership, with the publication of New Zealand’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) Action Plan. 

The OGP was established in 2011 and is an international partnership of countries aiming to foster openness, transparency and accountability to their citizens.

“The OGP Action Plan, published today, outlines our commitment to the Partnership, and to ensuring open and transparent government,” Mrs Bennett says. 

The four key initiatives in New Zealand’s Action Plan are the Government’s Better Public Service (BPS) Results programme, the ICT Strategy and Action Plan to 2017, the Government’s response to Transparency International New Zealand’s 2013 National Integrity System (NIS) Assessment report and the Kia Tūtahi Relationship Accord.

“The Plan will develop over time, as we work with New Zealanders to build on these commitments and identify new opportunities,” Mrs Bennett says.

OGP members are also required to commit to a minimum of two ‘grand challenges,’ and New Zealand has selected three:

- improving public services
- increasing public integrity
- more effectively managing public resources

“New Zealand has a strong and well respected foundation of open and transparent government, and formally joining the OGP gives us a fantastic opportunity to build on these successes,” Mrs Bennett says.

“We rank highly on several integrity measures, including first equal out of 182 countries in Transparency International’s 2013 Corruptions Perceptions Index and first out of 132 countries in the 2014 Social Progress index. 

“Our work in the OGP and with partner countries will allow us to do even more to deliver openness and integrity, so that New Zealanders can be assured government is responsive to their needs and serves them in the best way possible.”

A stakeholder-led advisory group will be established to assist the Government with meeting OGP commitments.
