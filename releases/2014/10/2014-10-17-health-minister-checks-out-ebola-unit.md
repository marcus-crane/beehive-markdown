Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today seen first-hand how Auckland’s Middlemore Hospital is well prepared to treat any suspected Ebola patients.

“While the risk to New Zealand remains low, we cannot guarantee that we won’t get a suspected case here,” says Dr Coleman.

“Middlemore Hospital is one of four major hospitals across New Zealand which are most likely to treat any suspected Ebola patients. Their new infectious diseases Biocontainment Unit is able to assess and manage patients with suspected highly infectious diseases.

“The Unit’s immediate function is to be ready to receive patients suspected of having Ebola. However, in the future it will be a valuable resource for dealing with infectious diseases that may be imported into New Zealand.”

The Biocontainment Unit has clearly marked areas correlating to infection risk, and clear pathways for staff to ensure there is no cross contamination between different zones. It also has new specialised protective equipment for staff to use when patients are in highly infectious stages of disease.

“Our health and border authorities are well prepared to detect and respond to any potential cases of Ebola. We are taking this very seriously,” says Dr Coleman.

66 people have been screened by Customs since additional border checks were introduced in early August. None have required laboratory testing.
