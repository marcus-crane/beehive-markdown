Education Minister Hekia Parata has today acknowledged the enormous contribution teachers across the country are making every day to ensure all children are successful in education.

Ms Parata says New Zealand Teachers’ Day, which is marked today, is an opportunity to thank teachers for the work they do to raise the educational achievement of students.

“Teachers do an incredible job helping our children and young people to be the very best they can be in life – it’s important to celebrate the magic that they create across our country every day.

“Improved teaching practice is continuing to help kids do much better, and we are seeing that through better outcomes in national standards and NCEA achievement.”

Ms Parata says parents and communities consistently back their teachers and school leaders because they know the difference they can make.

“The Government is also backing teachers through our $359 million investment that will keep the best teachers teaching, encourage collaboration between schools and strengthen school leadership.

“We all have stories about teachers who’ve made an incredible difference and those stories can be shared on the inspiredbyU.org.nz website.”

Ms Parata says teachers are also recognised through the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards, which celebrate excellence in teaching, leadership, community engagement and governance.
