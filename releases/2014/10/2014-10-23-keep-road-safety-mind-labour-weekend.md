Transport Minister Simon Bridges is encouraging road users to keep safe as they travel on the roads over Labour Weekend.

“Many people take advantage of the long weekend to see family and friends, or to get out on their motorcycle or bike, so roads can be busier than usual,” Mr Bridges says.

“Taking the time to make sure that you and your vehicle are in good nick before you get on the road, sticking to the road rules and being considerate of other road users all combine to make journeys safer.”

Over Labour weekend last year there was one fatal crash and 83 reported injury crashes. These crashes resulted in one fatality, 20 serious injuries and 91 minor injuries.

Last Labour Weekend’s road toll of one fatality was the lowest for the long weekend since 1956.

“Even one death on our roads is one too many, and we all need to work together to stay safe on the roads.

“Drive to the conditions, stay within the speed limit, don’t drive when you are affected by alcohol, drugs or fatigue – these are all things that will help ensure that everyone arrives home safe and sound,” Mr Bridges says.

The official Labour Weekend holiday period for 2014 begins at 4pm on Friday 24 October and ends at 6am on Tuesday 28 October.
