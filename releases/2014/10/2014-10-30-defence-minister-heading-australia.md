The Minister of Defence Gerry Brownlee leaves for Australia today for the annual Australia-New Zealand Defence Ministers’ Meeting, and to participate in the Albany Convoy Commemorative Event.

The event marks the 100th anniversary of the Australian Imperial Force and New Zealand Expeditionary Force troopships meeting then departing together to sail for Egypt.  Many of the soldiers on that voyage would be sent to Turkey to fight in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915.

While in Australia Mr Brownlee will meet with his Australian counterpart Senator David Johnston to share perspectives on important global and regional security issues.

The Ministers will look to discuss ways to deepen practical cooperation between the two respective defence forces; and ways in which they could engage more closely particularly in the South Pacific.

“I am looking forward to my first meeting with Senator Johnston in his hometown of Perth,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Australia is our closest ally and our most valuable trade and investment partner.

“It is important that we regularly discuss issues of mutual interest and our respective perspectives on global security issues.”
