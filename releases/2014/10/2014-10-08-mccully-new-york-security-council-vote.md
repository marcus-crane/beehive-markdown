Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully travels to New York today ahead of the United Nations Security Council elections.

“On 16 October New Zealand will vie with Spain and Turkey for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.

“The final days of our campaign are crucial and we will work hard right up to the vote to convince the international community that New Zealand deserves a place on the Council.

"The Security Council takes responsibility for international peace and security and to sit at this table is to take an active role in world affairs.

“It has been more than 20 years since New Zealand was last on the Council and we are ready to contribute again,” Mr McCully says.
