Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is encouraging New Zealanders to celebrate and participate in this week’s Fijian Language Week.

The theme this year is *Noqu Vosa, Noqu iYau Telei: My Language, My Treasure*. The theme highlights the importance of the link between language and heritage.

“This week is about celebrating and showcasing Fijian culture, language and the local Fijian community,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Fijian community is a small but fast growing part of our Pacific population in New Zealand. Census data shows that between 2006 and 2013, the Fijian population increased by 47 per cent. We now have 14,445 Fijians who have now made New Zealand their home.”

Fijian Language Week runs from 6 to 12 October. A range of events will take place around the country involving traditional performances, language programmes and cultural cuisine.

“Celebrating and sharing our cultural identity is essential for the wellbeing of our children, families and the wider community.  There is an exciting program of events throughout the week. I would encourage all New Zealanders to take part and to use the Fijian language in their homes, work places and communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga added.
