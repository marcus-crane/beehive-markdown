Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes Northland’s decision to fund free doctors’ visits and prescriptions for under 13s.

“The Government is investing $90 million over three years from 1 July 2015 so all children aged under 13 years can receive free doctors’ visits and prescriptions,” says Dr Coleman.

“Northland’s two Primary Health Organisations (PHO), Manaia Health and Te Tai Tokerau, and Northland DHB have joined together to fund the early roll out of this initiative, which is expected to cost around $450,000.

“DHBs and PHOs are best placed to respond to local need, and the Government welcomes Northland’s proactive approach as we seek to provide more services through primary care.

“The Northland initiative will mean an extra 16,000 school children can receive free doctors’ visits and prescriptions until the policy is implemented across the country.

“Healthcare providers in Northland have been quick to get behind this initiative, with all of the regions 153 GPs from the 38 general practices signing up.”
