Successful applicants from the New Zealand ballot for Gallipoli 2015 have three weeks left to accept their place at next year’s centenary Anzac Day commemorations, says Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“The last day to confirm attendance on the Gallipoli Peninsula is Saturday 25 October 2014. Travel booking details must also be provided by this time, so it is important that successful applicants get their plans in place if they haven’t already,” Mr Woodhouse says.

Currently, 374 people (39%) are yet to accept the offer of a double attendance pass. Ninety-five people have declined their offer of passes, and the passes are in the process of being re-allocated to those on the wait list. 

“I encourage those successful in the ballot to accept or decline their place as soon as possible. People who do not confirm their booking plans by 25 October will forfeit both their pass and their accompanying person pass, which will then be re-allocated to the next person on the wait list.

“If anyone is unsure of what is required, or has any questions, then now is the time to make contact. It will be too late to wait until after the deadline to seek advice and I would hate to see people miss out simply because they hadn’t confirmed their passes in time.

“Of course, anyone without a pass for the Anzac Day services also has the option to attend the non-balloted national service at Gallipoli on 8 August 2015, to commemorate the Battle of Chunuk Bair,” says Mr Woodhouse.
