Health Minister Jonathan Coleman is encouraging people to have a conversation today about organ donation.

“Today is Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Day and I hope people will support Organ Donation New Zealand’s campaign by having a discussion with family about their wishes around organ donation,” says Dr Coleman.

“Organ and tissue donation saves lives and improves the health of many New Zealanders. One donor can transform the lives of up to ten recipients. Having that conversation now may help people feel more comfortable with agreeing to organ donation.”

The government is investing an extra $4 million to establish a National Renal Transplant Service to increase the number of live kidney donor transplantations. This increase in funding builds on the $4 million investment in Budget 2012 to raise awareness and encourage more people to donate organs.
