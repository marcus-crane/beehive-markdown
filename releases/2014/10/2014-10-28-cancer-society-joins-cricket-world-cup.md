Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the ICC Cricket World Cup’s decision to appoint the Cancer Society as its official NZ charity partner.

“It is great to see the Cancer Society join up with the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Cricket World Cup is one of the biggest international sporting events, and the ICC’s partnership in New Zealand with the Cancer Society is an excellent opportunity to promote the work of the Cancer Society to a large audience.

“The Cancer Society does a fantastic job supporting cancer sufferers and their families, and helping to reduce the incidence and impact of cancer in New Zealand.

“Their SunSmart programme which highlights the importance of sun protection in preventing skin cancer is a very relevant message for cricket fans attending matches this summer as well as players and officials.”

The Cancer Society joins the ICC’s two global charity partners - THINK WISE which promotes awareness and understanding about HIV; and Room to Read, which promotes literacy – as well as the local charity partner in Australia, the McGrath Foundation.

The ICC Cricket World Cup returns to New Zealand and Australia in February and March 2015 for the first time in 23 years. The top 14 cricketing nations in the world will play 49 matches over 44 days, with 14 host cities spread evenly across New Zealand and Australia. More than a million people will attend matches and well over a billion are expected to watch the global broadcast.
