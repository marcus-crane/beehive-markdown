Finance Minister Bill English leaves tomorrow for the United States, where he will attend the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank governors in Washington DC.

He will also meet G20 finance ministers. Australia, as host of the G20 this year, has invited New Zealand to attend a series of meetings as a guest alongside the G20 members.

“The meetings in Washington will provide further opportunities to assess latest global economic developments and their likely impact on New Zealand,” Mr English says.

“New Zealand remains well placed compared with many other developed economies. But we need to be prepared to carefully manage global risks and challenges.

“So I’m keen to hear directly from the policy makers and business leaders dealing directly with these issues.”

During his trip, Mr English will meet Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey, Singapore Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and IMF deputy managing Director Min Zhu. He will also hold regular meetings with representatives of the main credit rating agencies.

The IMF and World Bank governors meeting concludes on Saturday and Mr English will return to New Zealand next Monday.
