Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the National Depression Initiative has won two major advertising awards at the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) Effectiveness awards in London.

“It is great to see New Zealand’s National Depression Initiative gain international recognition at the IPA awards,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is a tribute to the work of Sir John Kirwan, FCB New Zealand, the Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Agency who co-manage the programme. The National Depression initiative has been highly successful.

“Depression affects the lives of thousands of New Zealanders, and it is important people get the support and help that they need.”

The National Depression Initiative campaign won gold for the on-line tool ‘The Journal’ and also took out the best international campaign at the IPA awards.

‘The Journal’ is an online self-help tool fronted by former All Black Sir John Kirwan, who acts as an online personal coach to help people through a six-week programme. More than 47,000 people have signed up to use it.

The National Depression Initiative aims to reduce the impact of depression on the lives of New Zealanders, by aiding early recognition, appropriate treatment, and recovery.
