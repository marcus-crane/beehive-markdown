Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss will travel to Western Australia today to attend the Albany Convoy Commemorative Event (ACCE), marking 100 years since the first wave of Anzac troops set sail for the battlefields of World War One.

The ACCE, commemorating the troops’ departure from the port town of Albany on 1 November 1914, includes a troop march down the main street, the official dedication and opening of Australia’s National Anzac Centre, a re-enactment of the troopships’ departure and a commemorative service at Albany Peace Park.

During the service, Mr Foss will lay a wreath with his Australian counterpart, Senator Michael Ronaldson.

“Nearly 8500 Kiwi men were aboard those ships.  This event honours them and more than 90,000 other troops and nurses who later followed in their footsteps during WWI,” Mr Foss says.

“This is also an important opportunity to remember and pay tribute to our more contemporary veterans – to recognise the courage and commitment of all men and women who have fought for our country.”

Mr Foss and Senator Ronaldson will also meet to discuss next year’s Anzac day commemorations in Gallipoli. 

“New Zealand and Australia’s strong relationship was forged on the battlefield, it is only appropriate we work together to ensure another fitting commemoration for our servicemen and women,” Mr Foss says.

Tomorrow Mr Foss will visit the Commonwealth War Graves of four New Zealand soldiers – three Privates and a Serjeant Major – buried in Albany.
