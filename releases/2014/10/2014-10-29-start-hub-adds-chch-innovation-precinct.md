An Innovation Hub to support new and emerging businesses is the latest addition to the Christchurch Innovation Precinct, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce says.

A joint partnership between Canterbury Development Corporation and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Hub will support early stage entrepreneurs by providing the necessary technological and social infrastructure required by start-up and early-stage firms to grow.

“The establishment of this Hub will be instrumental in accelerating the development and success of start-up enterprises, within an environment that will encourage innovation and collaboration,” Mr Joyce says.

“Early-stage and start-up businesses are typically the generators of new ideas, and alongside larger firms with established market presence, will be a key component of the Precinct’s critical mass of innovative firms.

“These enterprises will benefit from being located alongside large companies and growth companies such as Vodafone and Kathmandu, supporting agencies such as Callaghan Innovation and NZTE, and the new ICT graduate school.”

The Precinct covers an area of approximately 3.6 hectares in the south-east corner of the Urban Frame and will be located within three city blocks bounded by Lichfield, Manchester, St Asaph, High, Tuam and Madras Streets.

MBIE is providing $900,000 in funding for the Innovation Hub. Design plans are under way and it is expected to open next year.
