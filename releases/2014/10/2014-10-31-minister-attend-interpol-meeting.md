Police Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to Monaco tomorrow to represent the New Zealand Government at the INTERPOL Ministerial Meeting on 3 – 4 November.

The INTERPOL Ministerial meeting will be held concurrently with the INTERPOL 83rd General Assembly which marks a century since the concept was proposed at the first International Police Congress held in Monaco in 1914. The 83rd General Assembly is themed ‘*Turn Back Crime: 100 years of International police cooperation*.’

“The upcoming INTERPOL meeting provides an excellent opportunity for me to engage with my international counterparts who hold law enforcement responsibilities,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“At this year’s meeting, I will be speaking on a panel addressing the theme ‘*Cooperation with the Public and Private Sectors: New Partnerships for a Safer World*’.

“This will enable New Zealand to lead and promote discussion around new policing models that focus on preventing crime and providing greater support to victims – something that is at the heart of our *Policing Excellence* programme.”

Minister Woodhouse will also travel to Mumbai where he will visit the Immigration New Zealand Office and engage with other NZ Inc. agencies, particularly in the export education sector, in his capacity as Immigration Minister.
