Social Development Minister Anne Tolley welcomes the latest release of benefit figures showing the number of people on welfare for the September quarter is the lowest since 2008, with sole parents leading the impressive results.

Today’s release of the September quarter benefit factsheets shows year-on-year benefit numbers continue to track downwards.

“There are over 10,000 fewer people on welfare compared to September 2013, and more than 70 per cent of these are sole parents,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Sole parents, particularly those who go on benefit in their teens, have the highest lifetime costs of any group on welfare and are more likely to stay on benefit the longest so this reduction is especially pleasing.

“The latest figures also point to positive trends in the years to come, as the reduction in sole parent benefits extends across all age groups.

“Our welfare reforms have been deliberately targeted at sole parents by investing millions into intensive support and training as well as help with study and childcare, so that working while raising children alone is achievable, and rewarding.

“With teen parents spending an average of 19 years on a benefit, and putting their kids at risk of becoming trapped in welfare dependency, the headway we are making now will pay off for generations,” says Mrs Tolley.

There are 3,300 fewer people on Jobseeker Support compared with 2013 and impressive reductions have been recorded in Canterbury and Auckland. The majority of regions around New Zealand recorded a decrease in Jobseeker Support numbers over the year.

“These figures show thousands of New Zealanders gaining financial independence by coming off welfare and show the reforms implemented by this Government are continuing to make a huge difference for these families.”
