Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today seen first-hand Wairarapa DHB’s innovative approach to streamlining the region’s needs assessments.

“We want New Zealanders to live healthier lives away from hospitals,” says Dr Coleman.

“To ensure people have the independence they want, it is important they are getting the appropriate integrated needs assessments and support services.”

DHBs run Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) agencies which review the care and services offered to people who may have age related needs, long term health or mental health conditions, or palliative care needs.

Typically DHBs have separate NASC services to manage different areas of care.

In Wairarapa the NASC agency is unique as it brings together all the relevant services under one banner called FOCUS.

“Wairarapa’s one stop shop approach is streamlining services and providing more integrated care, which is helping people manage their health in their own homes and preventing repeated hospital admissions,” says Dr Coleman.
