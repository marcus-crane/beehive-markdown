Associate Finance Minister Paula Bennett leaves Monday for Beijing where she will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) annual meeting of Finance Ministers.

The meeting, on 22 October, will consider the current economic situation and outlook in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as discussing co-operation on infrastructure investment and financing, among other issues. The meeting will be preceded by a ministers’ retreat on Tuesday.

“Having just taken on the Associate Finance role this is an early opportunity for me to personally meet other ministers from around the Asia-Pacific region, and to hear first-hand their concerns and insights about prospects for growth both within the region, and globally,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The Asia-Pacific region came through the Global Financial Crisis in better economic shape than some other parts of the world and it is this region that will help lead the global recovery towards sustainable and balanced growth. 

“As a small, outward-looking country, it’s important that New Zealand participates in forums like APEC so we ensure our voice is heard as the regional economies share views, exchange ideas, and deepen their co-operation. Being there also helps us understand emerging economic opportunities for New Zealand in the region.”

The APEC Finance Ministers’ meeting precedes the main event on the APEC calendar which is the APEC Economic Leaders’ meeting, due to be held in Beijing on November 10-11.

Mrs Bennett returns to New Zealand on 24 October.
