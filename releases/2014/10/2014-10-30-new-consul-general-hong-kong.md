Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat Gabrielle Rush as New Zealand’s new Consul-General in Hong Kong.

“Hong Kong is a dynamic city and is an important commercial and investment market for New Zealand companies,” Mr McCully says.

“With two-way goods trade of over $900 million a year it is an important gateway to mainland China for New Zealand firms. Since 2011 the New Zealand-Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership has secured duty-free access for New Zealand goods into Hong Kong and improved business flows.

“Hong Kong is currently New Zealand’s 15th largest goods export market and 8th biggest destination of services exports.

“Hong Kong has been a strong source of tourists with 29,000 visitor arrivals in the year to June 2014. This has been boosted by twice daily flights between Hong Kong and Auckland.

“New Zealand and Hong Kong are also linked together by rugby, with New Zealand beating England to win the HSBC Hong Kong Sevens Cup earlier in the year.

“New Zealand and Hong Kong have strong community links with a large number of New Zealanders resident there.  We are keen to see Hong Kong Special Administrative Region continue as a prosperous, peaceful and integrated part of the Asia-Pacific community,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Rush is an international lawyer and diplomat. She helped establish the New Zealand China Council following several years working in senior roles with the New Zealand International Business Forum and New Zealand United States Council.  She has been posted to the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing and our High Commission in London.
