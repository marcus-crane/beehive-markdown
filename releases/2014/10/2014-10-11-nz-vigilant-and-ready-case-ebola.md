Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says health and border authorities are well prepared to detect and respond to any potential cases of Ebola.

“We are treating the situation very seriously. While the risk to New Zealand remains low, we cannot guarantee that we won’t get a case here,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is quite possible that someone who has arrived here having travelled from a West African country affected by the Ebola outbreak will at some stage exhibit symptoms that need to be investigated. If they develop a fever within days of arrival we would have to rule out Ebola. It is far more likely these cases would turn out to be other illnesses like the recent cases in Australia.

“We have the best possible arrangements in place to deal with any suspected cases. While the risk is low, we are taking every precaution to keep New Zealand protected, and we have excellent health professionals achieving this.

“Ebola is not easy to catch. It is not spread through the air, and infection requires contact with infected bodily fluids. Existing isolation facilities and infection control protocols in our hospitals are suitable for treating a suspected or confirmed case of Ebola. Local and international expert advice is that Ebola would be well contained in countries like New Zealand.”

The Ministry of Health is working closely with the health sector and other agencies to ensure that any potential Ebola cases are quickly identified and contained. The Ministry also continues to closely monitor the advice of the World Health Organization to ensure our precautions are appropriate.

58 people have been screened since additional border screening was introduced on 10 August 2014 – none have caused concern. Anyone arriving in New Zealand who in the last month has visited West African countries affected by Ebola are screened for symptoms of the disease and exposure to the virus, and where necessary given an additional health assessment.
