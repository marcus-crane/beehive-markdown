Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today extended his deepest sympathies to the family of Mark Ford. 

“Mark was an exceptional New Zealander who was only too willing to use his considerable talents, both organisationally and personally, in contributing to projects of national significance.

“Following his very successful work leading the amalgamation of the Auckland councils he was a logical choice to chair the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT).

“His chairmanship bought a steady hand to what is cumulatively New Zealand’s biggest ever civil construction project.

“The success of the SCIRT programme will be part of his considerable legacy.

“I am deeply saddened by his passing.”
