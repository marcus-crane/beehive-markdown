Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart today for Sydney to join Ministers from countries participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) for the next round of negotiations.

“Negotiations are entering a crucial stage, with some of the most difficult issues remaining to be addressed in the negotiations such as agricultural market access, intellectual property and disciplines on state-owned enterprises,” Mr Groser says.

“The objective for this meeting will be to achieve further progress in these areas, which still require substantial work in order to move parties closer to conclusion.”  

New Zealand continues to be guided by the instructions from Leaders in Bali for Ministers and negotiators to resolve all issues consistent with the Honolulu objectives established by Leaders in 2011, to achieve a comprehensive and balanced regional agreement.

The TPP negotiation aims to create a free trade agreement covering 12 Asia-Pacific countries: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Viet Nam.
