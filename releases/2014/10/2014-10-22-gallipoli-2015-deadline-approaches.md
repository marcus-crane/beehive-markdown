Successful applicants of the Gallipoli 2015 ballot have just four days left to accept their place at next year’s Anzac Day commemorations, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says.

The deadline for accepting passes and completing travel details is Saturday 25 October.

“Nearly 300 people have not yet accepted the offer of two passes to the commemoration services at Gallipoli.  If the offers are not accepted by midnight Saturday, with travel details, the passes will be reallocated to those on the waiting list,” Mr Foss says.

From Sunday all online accounts will be locked for eight days to ensure the necessary information has been provided. 

“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I encourage everyone successful in the ballot to secure their place and provide as much travel detail as soon as possible,” Mr Foss says.

Those receiving reallocated passes will have until 7 December to accept the offer and confirm travel arrangements.

Mr Foss says anyone with queries regarding their application should contact the Gallipoli 2015 ballot office by emailing [info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz](mailto:info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz) or calling 0800 336 547.

Gallipoli 2015 is a key international commemoration of WW100, New Zealand’s First World War centenary programme. For more information, visit [www.gallipoli2015.govt.nz](http://www.gallipoli2015.govt.nz)
