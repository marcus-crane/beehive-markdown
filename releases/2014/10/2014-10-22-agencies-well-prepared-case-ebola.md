Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says government agencies remain prepared to deal with any potential Ebola cases in New Zealand.

“While the risk to New Zealand remains low, we are taking every precaution to deal with the threat of Ebola,” says Dr Coleman.

“I am receiving daily updates on the situation both here in New Zealand and overseas, and officials are constantly updating the comprehensive measures we have in place as part of the international response to the threat of Ebola.

“More than 20 agencies will be meeting tomorrow to discuss emerging infectious disease threats, including Ebola readiness activities. This is an excellent opportunity to ensure agencies are clear on the roles they would play in responding to a health emergency.”

The Inter-Agency Pandemic Group will be meeting in Wellington. The group includes a range of agencies including Police, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Civil Defence Emergency Management, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Ministry for Primary Industries.

73 people have been screened since additional border screening was introduced on 10 August 2014 – none have required laboratory testing.
