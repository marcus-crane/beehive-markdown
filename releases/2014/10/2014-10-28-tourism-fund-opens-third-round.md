Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced applications are open for the third round of funding in the Tourism Growth Partnership.

The $32 million contestable Government fund aims to boost innovation and productivity in the tourism sector. For each project approved for investment, the Government provides up to 50 per cent of the required funding.

“The Government has committed $6.28 million to Tourism Growth Partnership projects so far. This is matched by $25.4 million of co-funding from the industry, which shows the tourism industry, like the Government, is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains a great visitor destination,” says Mr Key.

“Associated industries that have the potential to lift productivity, for example the retail, hospitality and IT sectors, are also encouraged to apply where their focus is on international visitors. Innovation and productivity are not just confined to big projects and businesses, which is why there is also special criteria for projects under $100,000.

“Promoting New Zealand’s unique cultural aspects, restoring visitor confidence in the Canterbury region and growing emerging markets like China, Southeast Asia and South America are among the priorities of this funding programme.

“Tourism is the second biggest export earner, and biggest services export – contributing $10.3 billion to New Zealand’s total exports and $8.3 billion to New Zealand’s total GDP in the year ended March 2014. We want to keep building on that.”

The third Tourism Growth Partnership funding round will be accepting applications until 1 December 2014.
