Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga hosted the Prime Minister, Members of Parliament and representatives of the Indian community this evening in Parliament’s Grand Hall to celebrate Diwali.

“Diwali is a time of festivity and goodwill and is the most important festival of the year for many Hindus around the world.  Tonight’s event demonstrates how New Zealand embraces our wider Indian community and culture,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Diwali, the “festival of lights”, is an ancient festival celebrated each year.  It signifies the victory of light over darkness, wisdom over ignorance, good over evil, and hope over misery.

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with India built on solid and longstanding connections and many New Zealanders trace their origins to India.”

The last Census showed how much our population has changed over the last 15 years.  Indians have been coming to New Zealand since the late 18th century and Hindi is our fourth most spoken language. The number of Indian Kiwi’s has also more than doubled since 2001 with about 155,000 New Zealanders now of Indian ethnicity.

“New Zealand is one of the most diverse nations in the OECD.  Indian Kiwis are valued members of our nation, making a tremendous contribution at all levels and to a variety of sectors in our society,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I encourage all New Zealanders to embrace festivities like Diwali.  It is an opportunity for New Zealand’s Indian community to celebrate their heritage and showcase their culture’s vibrant colour, energy and stories.”
