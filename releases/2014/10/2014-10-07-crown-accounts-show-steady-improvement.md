The Government’s operating deficit before gains and losses narrowed for the third consecutive year to $2.9 billion in the 12 months to 30 June – down from $4.4 billion the previous year, Finance Minister Bill English says.

Net government debt increased from $55.8 billion to $59.9 billion in the latest year, but as a proportion of GDP it fell from 26.3 per cent to 26.2 per cent. This was $4.8 billion less than forecast in Budget 2013, with $2.5 billion of this driven by lower capital spending and proceeds from the Government’s share offer programme exceeding forecasts for the latest year.

“The result is further evidence that the Government’s careful fiscal management is producing consistent gains over time,” Mr English says.

“By setting a path back to surplus and running a clear economic plan to support growth, more jobs and higher incomes, the Government is providing opportunities for New Zealanders and their families to get ahead.

“New Zealand’s economic growth of 3.9 per cent in the year to June was the highest for a decade. But one or two years of growth will not change our economic prosperity - we need to stay on course over many years to really lift our long-term economic performance.

“Getting back to surplus this year and building larger surpluses into the future remains a significant challenge. It’s important that we return to surplus so we can start repaying the debt built up to support the most vulnerable New Zealanders through the previous recession and to help the people of Canterbury rebuild their lives.”

The $2.9 billion fiscal deficit for the year to 30 June followed core Crown tax revenue at $61.5 billion being lower than forecast and core Crown expenses at $71.5 billion also being a little below forecast.

“Tax revenue was $2.8 billion higher than the previous year, but it was just over $900 million lower than Treasury forecast in Budget 2013,” Mr English says. “It is possible that revenue will continue to track below forecast in the current financial year, which reinforces the need for the Government to continue controlling its spending.”

The latest OBEGAL deficit was equal to 1.3 per cent of GDP, down from 2.1 per cent of GDP the previous year, and 4.4 per cent of GDP the year before that.

“The Government will continue to focus strongly on managing expenditure tightly and stabilising and then reducing debt – including carefully managing its future capital needs,” Mr English says.

“One of these capital areas is state housing, where we will work closely with community and private providers to provide housing to New Zealanders most in need. This will allow us to draw on outside capital, rather than this being the sole responsibility of taxpayers.”

Mr English says New Zealand’s economic outlook remains positive, particularly compared with those of other developed economies.

“Growth is expected to return to more normal levels, reflecting international economic conditions and lower dairy prices.

“This reinforces our need to focus on the issues we can control, such as our own competitiveness, responsible fiscal and economic policy and delivering better public services.”

The Treasury will update its forecasts in the Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update on 16 December, alongside the Government’s annual Budget Policy Statement.
