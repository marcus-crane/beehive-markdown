Budget 2014 confirms a range of measures to support New Zealanders who live with disabilities, Disabilities Issues Minister Tariana Turia says.

It includes:

- New operating funding of $6 million over four years to provide vocational support services to school leavers with disabilities who are entering the Very High Needs Scheme.
- $3.8 million in new operating spending over 2014/15 to 2016/17 to extend the Enabling Good Lives disability support approach for the Waikato region.
- New operating funding of $6 million over four years to establish a body to promote New Zealand sign language.

“These are all important initiatives that will help New Zealanders with disabilities to live, work and participate in their communities,” Mrs Turia says.

“Those in the Very High Needs Scheme are likely to have a significant level of physical, intellectual or sensory impairments - or a combination of these - and have significant difficulties with learning, hearing, vision, mobility, language and communication. This new funding will help them to transition from school to adult life.

“The funding for the Enabling Good Lives approach will transform the disability support system in Waikato in a similar way to the approach currently in place in Christchurch, where those with disabilities can live independently.

“New Zealand sign language has been an official language since 2006. This new organisation will provide stewardship and advice on New Zealand sign language, which is an important tool for communication for the deaf community and their families and friends,” Mrs Turia says.
