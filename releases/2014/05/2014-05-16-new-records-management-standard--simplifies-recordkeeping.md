The new streamlined records management standard is simpler to use making it easier for public sector organisations to maintain and keep essential records, says Minister of Internal Affairs Hon Peter Dunne. Speaking at the launch of the standard Mr Dunne said good recordkeeping is essential for good government and the maintenance of accurate public records as legacy information.

“The records of government, documenting the nation’s official history and the stories of our heritage help us share our stories and establish what makes us the nation we are today.

“Added to this good recordkeeping also makes for more efficient business. Ensuring resources are spent managing only those records that are needed for business and accountability purposes is a powerful argument for taking the time and trouble to make sure we get it right,” says Mr Dunne. 

Good creation, maintenance and appropriate disposal of records are not just of historical interest, but are fundamental to good governance.  It helps protect the rights and entitlements of individuals, supports accountability and transparency in government, and sound evidence-based decision making.

One of the primary objectives of the Public Records Act 2005 is to give the Chief Archivist the ability to raise the standard of recordkeeping across government. 

“This is why rolling the four current mandatory recordkeeping standards into one makes sense. The new standard is simpler than the current ones and with less duplication is easier to understand and use and as a result will have more impact.

“This new standard provides the public sector with the guidance to make the records they really need and realise the true value of records as information assets. Finding and accessing the right records at the right time saves time and money and makes good business sense.

“All New Zealanders need to know and be reassured that public sector information is trusted and available when it’s needed, both now and in the future,” says Mr Dunne.
