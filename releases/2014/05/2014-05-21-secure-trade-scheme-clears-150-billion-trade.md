Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today recognised the Customs Service’s Secure Exports Scheme for handling more than $150 billion in trade since its inception 10 years ago.

The scheme provides a secure supply chain from the point of packing the container to delivery at the New Zealand port of departure. Because a container’s security is assured, it is less likely to encounter delays.

“Growth has been such that $19 billion in trade was processed through the scheme in 2013, which amounts to almost of third of all exports.

“Because the scheme helps to protect exports from tampering, sabotage or smuggling, exporters get enhanced border clearance privileges in the United States, Republic of Korea and Japan, where we have Mutual Recognition Arrangements,” Ms Wagner says.

SES exporters are 3.5 times less likely than any other trader to be examined for security purposes by United States Customs and Border Protection.

More than 120 exporters are part of the Secure Exports Scheme.
