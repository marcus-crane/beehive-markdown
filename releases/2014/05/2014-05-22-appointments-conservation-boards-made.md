Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today announced 124 appointments to the 14 Conservation Boards around the country.

“I extend my congratulations to all the community representatives who’ve been appointed in 2014, particularly the 88 who will serve for the first time.

“The diverse range of appointees will bring a wide array of knowledge and skills to conservation management to benefit the communities they represent.

“We want to encourage all New Zealanders to get out and enjoy our magnificent country.  This year, Boards will have a greater focus on promoting recreation opportunities and tourism on conservation land, and enhancing relationships with iwi/hapū,” Ms Wagner says.

Conservation Boards are the link between the community and the Department of Conservation.  They advise the New Zealand Conservation Authority and Department on strategic direction and planning for their respective regions.

In total, there were 292 applications for positions on Conservation Boards.

“That level of community interest in conservation management is to be applauded, and I want to thank all those applicants for their ongoing commitment to the conservation estate,” Ms Wagner says.

A restructure of the eastern North Island boards by Conservation Minister Nick Smith has seen the East Coast/Bay of Plenty Board and Wellington/Hawke’s Bay Board reformed into three boards covering Bay of Plenty, East Coast/Hawke’s Bay and Wellington.
