The Minister for Disability Issues Tariana Turia has announced the Disability Action Plan 2014-2018 today. The new plan is a collaborative effort between government agencies and representatives from Disabled People’s Organisations (DPO’s).

“I am pleased with this new collaborative approach. The Disability community is taking a leading role in policy, planning and  implementation. Priority actions will now be developed in consultation with them along with government agencies and other disability sector experts,” says Minister Turia.

“This cross-government approach on disability issues will assist in removing many of the barriers to participation in society that disabled people experience.”

“This new plan is centred on what disabled people say matters the most to them – being treated as equal New Zealanders with the same rights of citizenship and participation in society.”

“I encourage all government agencies to take on this approach. Agencies working together with DPO’s on disability-related issues can result in better and more informed policy thinking which reflects the real lives of disabled people,” says Mrs Turia.

The Office for Disability Issues will lead coordination and monitoring of the Disability Action Plan and promote government agencies collaborating with DPO’s into the future. Progress will be overseen and monitored by a new governance arrangement consisting of quarterly meetings of the Chief Executives’ Group on Disability Issues and DPO representatives.
