The Government has announced new funding of $16 million over four years to support the repair and rebuild of rural housing, the improvement of housing on the Chatham Islands and the development of Māori social housing providers.

“New Zealanders living in remote rural areas face a number of unique and often difficult challenges, including the cost and availability of decent housing,” Associate Housing Minister Tariana Turia says.

“That is why the Government has allocated funding to improve housing in rural New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands. Compared to the rest of the population, significantly more Māori are experiencing housing deprivation and are more likely to be state tenants or renters than home owners.

“Iwi are incorporating housing into their long-term planning and the Government currently has accords with at least five iwi. Budget 2014 will take major steps to help iwi and the Crown achieve these housing aspirations.

“This fund will support the repair and rebuild of rural housing, the improvement of housing on the Chatham Islands, and the development of Māori social housing providers through capability and capacity building and capital grants.

“It will allow iwi and other collectives to hold a fund for small loans or grants to home owners for repairs to substandard houses in rural areas. These loans or grants will run alongside other housing and community initiatives.

“Decent, warm, dry housing is a significant issue and has a huge impact on the health and well-being of families. This new housing initiative is a result of the Māori Party relationship accord with the Government along with the home insulation Warm-up New Zealand homes programme,” Mrs Turia says.
