Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has today named diplomat Robert Kaiwai as New Zealand’s first Consul-General in Honolulu, Hawai’i.

“New Zealand is looking to step up our diplomatic engagement with the Northern Pacific and work closely with the United States on Pacific issues,” Mr McCully says.

“We welcome the United States’ continued involvement in the region and our close cooperation in areas like humanitarian aid, fisheries and disaster risk management.

“Our new Consul-General will be responsible for building on this work and engaging with United States officials and experts regional security issues.”

Mr Kaiwai will also be cross-accredited to Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

“The smaller states of the Northern Pacific have taken centre stage in the region recently. The Marshall Islands hosted last years’ Pacific Islands Forum and Palau is set to host this year.

“Our Consul-General in Honolulu will lead our engagement with Palau on Forum matters and our work with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands on issues such as climate change and fisheries,” Mr McCully said.

Mr Kaiwai has been New Zealand’s Consul-General in Hong Kong since 2011 and was previously High Commissioner to Kiribati.
