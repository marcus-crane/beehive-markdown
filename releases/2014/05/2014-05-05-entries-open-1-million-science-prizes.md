Entries open today for the 2014 Prime Minister’s Science Prizes, which will award a total of $1 million in prize money to some of New Zealand’s top scientists and researchers.

A total of five prizes are presented each year, with the aim of highlighting how science underpins innovation and helps to build a more competitive and productive economy.

Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce says the prizes are an important component in the Government’s programme of supporting and motivating New Zealand’s most talented scientists.

“The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes recognise researchers of the highest quality who are working on projects that are of real benefit to New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“In addition, the prizes raise the profile and prestige of science, which has an important role to play in New Zealand’s economic growth and international competitiveness.

“I encourage all eligible top performing scientists to consider entering this year’s prizes.”

The awards also aim to encourage more students into science and technology based careers, with a $50,000 prize towards tertiary study costs for an outstanding secondary school student.

The Prime Minister launched the prizes six years ago. The 2013 winners of the top prize, valued at $500,000, were two University of Auckland professors who have pioneered inductive power transfer technology.

Professors John Boys and Grant Covic’s inventions are used throughout the world, from factories that depend on automated systems or clean-room environments, to charging electric vehicles (EV).

Other past winners have been researching in the areas of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, superconductivity, climate change science and food innovation.

The prizes are:

- **The Prime Minister’s Science Prize, $500,000**
  
  To an individual or team which has made a transformative discovery or achievement in science that has had a significant impact on New Zealand or internationally
