Maritime New Zealand will receive $2.9 million of new capital funding from the Future Investment Fund to help it adopt the latest technology necessary for optimum performance, Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“This new funding will assist Maritime NZ to develop the information system required to support the new maritime operator safety system and the seafarer certification rules,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We are a maritime nation, with over 99 per cent of export trade, worth $38.1 billion in 2013, being carried by sea. The maritime operator safety system and associated seafarer certification support the effective operation of that capability.

“This directly supports the Government’s Business Growth Agenda’s focus on export markets, natural resources and safe and skilled workplace management.”
