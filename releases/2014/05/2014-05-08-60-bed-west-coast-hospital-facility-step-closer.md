Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the business case for the new 60-bed hospital facility on the West Coast has been signed off and the project is now in the final design phase.

Mr Ryall said in September last year we gave the Grey Base Hospital redevelopment the green light and this week Cabinet has approved the $67 million greenfield development plan where virtually all of the hospital is rebuilt.

“There will be new wards, a bigger maternity unit, four older person rehabilitation cottages, an emergency department, intensive care unit, three state-of-art operating theatres. There will also be an integrated family healthcare centre on the Greymouth hospital site.

“There has been a lot of misinformation around the Grey Base Hospital redevelopment. Today’s announcement shows this National-led government is committed to future-proof health services on the West Coast.

“Grey Base Hospital will be the biggest hospital investment per head of population in New Zealand’s history.

“In addition to the $67 million, there will be $1 million for demolition costs for a new car park opening in 2016, and further funding for the development of the inpatient mental health facility which will commence in 2017.

“I would like to thank the West Coast clinicians, design team and partnership group for their hard work developing the business case,” said Mr Ryall.

Site work is expected to begin later this year.
