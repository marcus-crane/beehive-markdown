Budget 2014 supports three major initiatives as a result of the Māori Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan He Kai Kei Aku Ringa*,* Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says.

They are:

- $8 million in operating funding over four years towards a Māori Innovation Fund, to be managed jointly by the Minister of Science and Innovation and the Minister of Māori Affairs.
- $6 million in operating funding over four years towards New Zealand Māori Tourism to support a number of initiatives, including building industry capability, branding, and leveraging Māori tourism and trade.
- $1 million, of which $500,000 is in new operating funds and $500,000  reprioritised spending, for a joint New Zealand Māori and Chinese stage production that builds on work in bridging cultural and economic relationships between New Zealand and China.

These initiatives will support the implementation of He Kai Kei Aku Ringa, the Māori Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan released in 2012, Dr Sharples says.

“Māori economic development is an important component of our social development, and the development of our communities. He Kai Kei Aku Ringa identifies how we can support Māori economic development into the future for the benefit of New Zealand.

“All of these initiatives are about putting Māori business, Māori people, and Māori culture on the world stage, encouraging innovation and growth, and building relationships that go beyond just economic benefits. They are founded on cultural respect and manaakitanga. Those are the foundation principles of He Kai Kei Aku Ringa,” Dr Sharples says.
