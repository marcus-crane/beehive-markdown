Budget 2014 commits new operating funding of $15 million over three years from 2015/16 for the Whānau Ora navigators’ work with whānau and families, Whānau Ora Minister Tariana Turia says.

The extra funding will help whānau and their engagement in a range of services.

“The navigators, who support engagement with whānau and families to achieve their goals, have been crucial in helping families to develop a plan to address their needs and help them access a range of services,” Mrs Turia says.

“The role of the navigators is to increase the capacity of whānau and families to do more for themselves, to become self-reliant, and to make their own decisions for their future.

“This ongoing funding will ensure that families have the support they need on their pathway to a better future.”

Meanwhile, the Government has also announced a contestable $10 million fund over four years to focus on Māori sporting and cultural activities and support for sports and cultural bodies.

“Sport and culture is an intrinsic part of Māori communities,” Mrs Turia says. “Our cultural and sporting bodies play a huge role in nurturing whanaungatanga among families, as well as providing opportunities for exercise and recreation.”

The $10 million allocation is a reprioritisation from the Whakamana Leadership Fund from Vote Māori Affairs.
