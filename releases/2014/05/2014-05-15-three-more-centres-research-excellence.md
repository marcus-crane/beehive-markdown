The Government will fund three additional Centres of Research Excellence (CoREs) from 2016, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

Budget 2014 boosts CoREs operating funding by $53 million over four years. Annual ongoing funding will increase to $49.8 million from 2016/17 to support three additional CoREs, bringing the total number able to be funded up to 10.

“CoREs are cross-institutional research networks that support production of the absolute best research and researchers in tertiary education institutions across New Zealand.

“By investing in additional CoREs the Government is increasing its support for excellent research in areas that are important to New Zealand’s future development,” Mr Joyce says.

The decision follows the recent announcement by the Tertiary Education Commission of the results of the 2013/14 selection round in which six CoREs will receive funding from 2015.

A total of four additional CoREs will be selected through a competitive selection process: three that will be funded through the new funding, and one from money from the existing appropriation. One of the four additional CoREs will be dedicated to Māori development research.

“When Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga was not successful in the current CoRE round, the Government decided it was important to have a dedicated Māori Centre of Research Excellence as part of our commitment to Vision Mātauranga research and because such a network is completely unique to New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga will have the opportunity to tender for that CoRE, alongside other possible collaborations of Maori researchers at tertiary education institutions, including wānanga, to ensure a competitive process.

The other three CoREs will be selected through a closed tender of the remainder of the 21 applicants that were unsuccessful in the just-completed round.

“Centres of Research Excellence have become an important tool for lifting research quality and encouraging networking and collaboration across the tertiary sector. 

“This investment will increase the contribution of tertiary education to New Zealand’s economic goals and better position institutions to take advantage of international research linkages,” Mr Joyce says.
