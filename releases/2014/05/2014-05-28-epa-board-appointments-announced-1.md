Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced the appointment of a new Environmental Protection Authority Board member and confirmed the reappointment of the Chair and one other member.

“I am pleased to announce that Kura Denness has been appointed as a member of the Environmental Protection Authority Board for a three-year term,” Ms Adams says.

“Ms Denness has experience working as a Chief Financial Officer in the oil and gas industry, which will be invaluable to the EPA Board as they consider consent applications under the Exclusive Economic Zone Act.

Ms Denness will replace Anake Goodall who resigned from the Board in February this year.

As the role of the EPA in the new Exclusive Economic Zone consenting process increases, the Board needs members experienced in both tikanga Māori and the Treaty of Waitangi, as well as knowledge of the marine oil and gas industry. 

“Ms Denness is being appointed because of her experience in the oil and gas industry, and tikanga Maori. I am confident that any conflicts of interest arising from this previous experience and her iwi affiliations will be managed by the robust processes the EPA Board has in place.”

Ms Adams has also reappointed Kerry Prendergast as Chair and Taria Tahana as a member of the EPA Board, both for further three-year terms.

“Ms Prendergast has been a highly effective Chair that has successfully led the EPA through its establishment phase. I am pleased that she has agreed to continue in this role.

“During her time on the Board, Ms Tahana has brought a vital Māori business perspective and an understanding of economics to the Board.”

The full EPA Board is Kerry Prendergast (Chair), Dr Kevin Thompson (Deputy Chair), Tim Lusk, Taria Tahana, Gillian Wratt, Andrew von Dadelszen, Dr Nicola Crauford and Kura Denness.
