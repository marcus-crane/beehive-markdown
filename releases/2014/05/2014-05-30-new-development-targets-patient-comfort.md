Health Minister Tony Ryall has welcomed the opening of the new discharge lounge at Middlemore Hospital this week which will allow patients to wait comfortably for their paperwork to be completed before they return home.

Mr Ryall says the new lounge is one of a number of initiatives Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) is trialling to ensure Middlemore Hospital runs smoothly during the busy winter months ahead.

“This discharge lounge will focus on patient comfort and ensure the DHB is delivering the best care for the duration of a patient’s stay in hospital. Around 70 people are expected to move through it each day.

“Patients will have support from healthcare staff as well as access to lazy boy chairs, magazines, televisions, as well as tea and coffee facilities.

“The initiative will also mean family members can wait comfortably with patients.”

“The discharge lounge will have a flow on affect as it frees up beds in the wards for new admissions. This initiative is another example of public hospitals using new approaches to speed up care,” said Mr Ryall.
