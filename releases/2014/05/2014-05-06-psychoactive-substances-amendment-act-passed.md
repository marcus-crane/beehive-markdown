Health Minister Tony Ryall has welcomed Parliament’s support for the Psychoactive Substances Amendment Act, passed today under urgency.

The Act, expected to receive Royal assent on Wednesday and become law on Thursday 8 May 2014, removes all remaining psychoactive products on the market. It also bans the use of animal testing data in support of product approvals.

“When the Psychoactive Substances Act was passed last year, some products were allowed to stay on the market,” says Mr Ryall. 

“The amendment means all interim retail and wholesale licences will be cancelled and all psychoactive products given interim approval will be removed from sale. It will also become illegal to possess and supply the products.

“While animal testing remains a necessary and important component of the process for developing a number of important products, such as medicines, the government does not believe that such testing was justifiable for the recreational drug market.

“The intent of the original Psychoactive Substances Act remains with approved low risk products able to come to market in the future when regulations are made,” said Mr Ryall.

All psychoactive products will become unapproved from Thursday and it will be an offence to possess, supply or sell them. Those in possession of products are advised to return them to the retailer they purchased them from.
