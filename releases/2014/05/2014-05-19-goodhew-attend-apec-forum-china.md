Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew will travel to Beijing today to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Women and the Economy Forum as Head of the New Zealand delegation.

“The APEC Women and the Economy Forum is a Ministerial-level meeting with a focus on developing policy recommendations for women and innovative economic growth. This focus aligns well with my work in New Zealand to increase women’s economic independence.

“New Zealand has a strong reputation internationally on gender equality. This is an opportunity to share our work – at the highest level - to improve the lives of women across our region, and to learn from other economies.

“My attendance at this meeting will also strengthen our bilateral relationship with China and supports our participation in APEC,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Women and the Economy Forum is being held from Wednesday 21 to Friday 23 May 2014.

It will focus on strategies and actions for promoting women’s participation in three key areas: women and green development; women and regional economic and trade cooperation; and policy support and women’s economic empowerment.

The Forum is one of nine Ministerial meetings to be hosted by China in advance of the Leaders’ Summit in November 2014.
