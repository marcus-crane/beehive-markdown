Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is on the road seeking the input of Pacific communities to help promote the success of Pacific people in New Zealand.

His nationwide tour includes Counties Manukau, West Auckland, Wellington Central, Porirua, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill.   He also recently visited with Pacific communities in Hamilton, Levin, North Shore and the Hutt Valley.

“We have seen a real growth in jobs and incomes for Pacific people particularly in the regions,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.  “I need to be on the ground listening to Pacific people in cities, regions and provinces.”

Nine of 11 regions around New Zealand had an increase of Pacific people in jobs in the last quarter to March 2014. Otago and Canterbury both had an increase of 21 per cent of Pacific people in jobs for the year ending March 2014. Wellington increased by 9.4 per cent for the same period.

In general Pacific employment rose from March 2013 to March 2014 when 7,900 more Pacific people went to work. 

“The latest labour results show the growing strength of the New Zealand economy and the fact Pacific people are benefiting directly from this.

“By visiting our people across New Zealand and capturing Pacific aspirations and feedback, we as a government can better support Pacific success and achievement.

“We are well on our way to advancing Pacific ambitions in New Zealand.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga says Pacific communities prefer direct engagement and he is keen to meet with as many people as he can.

He will be in Porirua tonight for his penultimate *fono*.  This Sunday he is joining the Prime Minister’s Pacific Mission delegation to Samoa, Tonga and Niue.  The party will be celebrating Samoa’s 52nd anniversary of Independence Day in Samoa.
