Aucklanders at risk of diabetes have a new nutrition and activity programme available to help them to improve their health.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said Harbour Sport Trust has been awarded a $500,000 contract for the ‘Choose Change’ programme which supports people who have been diagnosed as pre-diabetic or with Type 2 diabetes.

“Each participant will get a personalised plan, which will include goal setting, nutrition advice, and exercise options. They will be supported and have their progress monitored by a healthy lifestyles coordinator over a six month period.

“The programme is very comprehensive. It will give people the tools to make positive changes to their lifestyle and take control of their own health.

“This government is tackling obesity, one of the main causes for diabetes, by investing in programmes, like ‘Choose Change’, that encourage people to eat healthier, get active and improve their health,” says Mr Ryall.

The ‘Choose Change’ project will run for 12 months from July 2014, allowing for three six-month programmes to be delivered to around 240 people.

The Harbour Sport Trust is partnering with Sport Waitakere, Sport Auckland and Counties Manukau Sport to deliver the ‘Choose Change’ programme.
