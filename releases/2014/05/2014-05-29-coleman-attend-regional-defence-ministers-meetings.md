Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman is today travelling to Singapore to join his counterparts at the Shangri-La Dialogue. He will also attend the Five Powers Defence Arrangements Defence Ministers’ Meeting in Malaysia.

Dr Coleman will hold a number of bilateral meetings with counterparts from a range of countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, France, the UK, Republic of Korea, and Japan.

“New Zealand has a long history of active defence engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. These meetings are a good opportunity for partners to discuss the major security challenges facing our region,” says Dr Coleman.

“They also provide a valuable opportunity to further develop our practical co-operation, and to strengthen our relationships with a wide range of defence partners.

“New Zealand has a very real stake in the security of the Asia-Pacific region. A stable and secure environment is vital as it underpins economic prosperity and development. The Asia-Pacific is of significant economic and strategic interest to New Zealand with six of our top ten trading partners in the region.”

Around 30 countries are attending the 13th annual Shangri-La Dialogue on 30 May to 1 June 2014. Following the Shangri-La Dialogue, Dr Coleman will attend the Five Powers Defence Arrangements (FPDA) Defence Ministers’ Meeting on 1 June 2014 in Malaysia. The FPDA is held every three years.

“As one of New Zealand’s oldest defence arrangements, the FPDA forms the cornerstone of our defence and security engagement in the region,” says Dr Coleman.

“The FPDA Ministers’ meeting provides the opportunity for New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and the UK to set the priorities for our security co-operation.”
