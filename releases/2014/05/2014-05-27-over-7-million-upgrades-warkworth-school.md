The Government is investing $7.6 million in Warkworth School to upgrade its buildings and facilities, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“The increased funding is to be used to replace the old buildings that make up the majority of the junior school, and replace some permanent buildings past their useful life. The redevelopment will also address onsite flooding from poor drainage that causes dampness beneath school buildings,” says Ms Kaye.

“Warkworth is one of the priority schools in New Zealand that will receive a major redevelopment over the next six years. The Government is investing approximately $300 million over six years to assist approximately 30 schools with the most complex infrastructure issues.

“Warkworth is a region of intensive future development and roll growth. This $7.6 million redevelopment will see more modern classrooms to address roll growth. The redevelopment will ensure Warkworth School continues to deliver a high standard of education to the community.

“The Warkworth upgrade is part of the Government’s plan to raise student achievement. The rebuild will help create a more modern and inspiring learning environment for all of Warkworth School’s students and their teachers.

“Over the last 5 years we have spent over $2 billion upgrading schools so that students can learn and achieve in the best possible environments,” says Ms Kaye

Construction is expected to commence later this year.
