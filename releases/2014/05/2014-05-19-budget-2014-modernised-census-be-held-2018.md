Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner today announced a new internet first model will transform how the census is delivered and collected, and will increase the use of administrative data.

Budget 2014 provides an initial $13.1 million of new operating funding in 2014/15 and $547,000 of new capital funds from the Future Investment Fund towards a modernised census to be held in 2018.

“The 2018 Census will have a target of 70 per cent of forms completed online, a workforce half the 7,500 used in 2013, and investment in systems and processes that support a future model that further utilises administrative data.

“A modernised census will deliver more timely and relevant data, which is important for regions that are changing rapidly and it will help inform decisions on how billions of dollars of government funding is spent.

“Modernising what was a dated model is also consistent with, and will contribute to, the government’s ICT Strategy, Better Public Services and the New Zealand Geospatial Strategy.

“The funding will also allow work to continue on the Census Transformation Programme, which is investigating the feasibility of an administrative data only census,” Nicky Wagner says.

Administrative data is data collected by government agencies or private organisations in conducting their businesses or services.

For the 2018 Census people will still be able to request paper forms be delivered to their household.
