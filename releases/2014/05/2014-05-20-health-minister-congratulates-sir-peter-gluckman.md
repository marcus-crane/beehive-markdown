Health Minister Tony Ryall has congratulated Sir Peter Gluckman on his appointment by the World Health Organisation to co-chair the Commission to end Childhood Obesity.

The Commission will be tasked with delivering a report to the World Health Organisation on which approaches will be most effective in tackling childhood obesity in different contexts around the globe.

“Sir Peter’s advice on tackling childhood obesity has guided this Government’s anti-obesity policy, Healthy Families NZ,” says Mr Ryall.

“I congratulate Sir Peter Gluckman on his appointment.”

Sir Peter, Chief Science Adviser to the Prime Minister, has been working with Dr Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organisation for several months on this initiative.

Dr Sania Nishtar, a public health scientist and former Minister of Science and Education from Pakistan, has been appointed co-chair with Sir Peter.

The Commission will present its report in 2015.
