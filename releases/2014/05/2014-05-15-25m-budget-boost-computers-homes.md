The Budget allocates $2.5 million in additional operating funding in 2014/15 to continue to provide more computers in homes and digital literacy training for low-income families, Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye say.

“This increased funding means up to 1,500 more low-income families will learn basic computer skills and be provided with access to the internet,” Ms Parata says.

“This will result in families being more engaged with their children’s education.

“We want to ensure that children, families and their communities can take full advantage of the suite of digital literacy initiatives the Government is rolling out,” Ms Parata says.

Computers in Homes is run by the not-for-profit 2020 Communications Trust, and began as a pilot project in 2000. It has provided thousands of families in low-income communities with access to digital technology and the skills to use it fully in education, training and employment.

“Making the most of technology and digital content is essential to raising achievement for children and young people,” Ms Kaye says.

“Computers in Homes provides students and families in the most need with a computer, training and support, and home connectivity.

“When parents gain skills in using digital technology, they are able to enhance their children’s learning beyond the regular school day. I am pleased that Computers in Homes will continue this important work for a further year and continue to provide a range of benefits to families and their communities,” Ms Kaye says.
