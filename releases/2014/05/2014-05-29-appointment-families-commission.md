Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today announced the appointment of Mr Haami Piripi to the board of the Families Commission.

Mr Piripi is a former Chief Executive of the Maori Language Commission, and is nearing completion of his third term as Chair of Te Runanga O Te Rarawa.

“Mr Piripi has a detailed understanding of the social sector, and the delivery of services by both government and non-government providers,” Mrs Bennett said.

“He has played a significant role in the “Make it Happen Te Hiku” project, which is closely linked to the Te Hiku Social Development and Wellbeing Accord signed by the Prime Minister and iwi leaders in 2013.”

“His appointment will add to the Commission’s depth of experience at what is a pivotal time for the Families Commission, following the creation of the Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit (SuPERU) last year.”

“The Families Commission is committed to providing robust, independent research and advice, and Mr Piripi is well suited to contribute given his extensive expertise in this area.”

Mr Piripi has been appointed to the board for a term of three years.
