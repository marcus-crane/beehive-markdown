Foreign Minister Murray McCully is travelling to Guyana to attend the annual meeting of Foreign Ministers from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) over the coming week.

“The Caribbean and our own Pacific region share a number of similar challenges and opportunities,” says Mr McCully.

“CARICOM is the Caribbean equivalent of our Pacific Islands Forum and the meeting presents an opportunity to update my counterparts on our growing relationship with the region.

“It is also a chance to discuss regional approaches to the issues that impact small island developing states, such as; renewable energy, oceans and fisheries and disaster risk management,” says Mr McCully.

The Minister will make calls in Havana, Cuba before CARICOM, and following the meeting he will visit New Zealand’s Mission to the United Nations in New York.

In New York the Minister undertake a range of activities in support of New Zealand’s candidacy for the United Nations Security Council, including making a presentation to Permanent Representatives from the Arab Group of countries.
