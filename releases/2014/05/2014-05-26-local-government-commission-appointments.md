Local Government Minister Paula Bennett today announced the reappointment of Basil Morrison (Chair) and Anne Carter, and the appointment of Janie Annear as Members of the Local Government Commission. 

“The appointments ensure the Commission has the knowledge and expertise it needs in a time of considerable change in the local government environment. All three appointments are for one-year terms,” says Mrs Bennett.

Mr Morrison is a former Mayor of the Hauraki District Council and Chair of Local Government New Zealand. He has been the Commission Chair since 2011.

Ms Carter is an experienced former public servant with a particular focus on strategy development and policy formulation.  She has knowledge of Tikanga Maori and has been a Commissioner since 2011. 

Ms Annear has considerable experience in local government having served three terms as the mayor of Timaru from 2004 to 2013.

The Local Government Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Local Government Act 2002. Its main roles are to make decisions about the structure and boundaries of local government and the representation arrangements for local authorities.

Mrs Bennett thanked outgoing member Grant Kirby for his service and significant contribution to the Commission’s work.
