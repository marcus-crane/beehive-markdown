Revenue Minister Todd McClay has announced the establishment of the Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel to give New Zealanders a voice in simplifying, modernising and transforming the way we pay tax.

The Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel will ask customers to submit their views on any aspect of tax compliance to find areas where Inland Revenue can make paying tax easier for taxpayers.

Part of the IR4U programme of better engaging with the public, the Panel will consist of representatives of individual taxpayers, small businesses, and also the tax advisory community.

“Increasingly Inland Revenue is a customer service focused agency and the Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel will be an important tool for taxpayers to interact directly with us,” Mr McClay says.

“It is a chance for Kiwis to have their say on Inland Revenue’s processes, to tell us about the things that might frustrate them, and submit ideas about how things can be done better.”

There are more than 3 million PAYE taxpayers alone.

“I am particularly keen that we engage with individual taxpayers and small-to-medium business owners about how we can reduce the amount of time they spend on red-tape and tax compliance.”

New Zealand has over 450 000 SMEs, which account for 97 per cent of all businesses.

“It is my view that currently small business owners are required to spend far too much time on tax compliance, which is time better spent on running their businesses.”

Inland Revenue’s ‘Save Time’ campaign for businesses in Hawkes Bay has already received 300 web or text submissions since going live on 7 May. The Panel will consider data gathered from this as part of its first tranche of work.

“The Panel will also be a valuable tool in further considering the modernisation and transformation of Inland Revenue’s business as part of our Business Transformation agenda.”

“The Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel will help Inland Revenue ensure they are consistent with the objective of making tax compliance faster and easier,” Mr McClay says.
