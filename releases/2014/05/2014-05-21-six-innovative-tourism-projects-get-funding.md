Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced the Government’s Tourism Growth Partnership is investing in six projects to grow the tourism sector in New Zealand.

“The Tourism Growth Partnership is investing $3.84 million in the projects in this first round of funding. This is in addition to $23 million from the applicants, giving a total $26.8 million investment in the tourism industry.

Investing in a wide range of innovative tourism projects will help the New Zealand tourism industry as a whole – and create jobs in New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government has made $32 million available over four years to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities and overcome barriers to growth in the tourism sector.

The Tourism Growth Partnership is a co-investment programme. For each project approved for investment, the Government will provide up to 50 per cent of the required funding.

“Tourism is one of New Zealand’s largest export earners and has a crucial role to grow our economy,” says Mr Key.

The Tourism Growth Partnership is part of a $158 million investment Government has made in tourism.

A second round of funding is now open for applications and will close at the end of the month.

The projects selected will be announced later this year.

Successful applicants are attached.
