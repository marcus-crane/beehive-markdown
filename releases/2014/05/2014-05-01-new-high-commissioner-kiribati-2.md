Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has announced Don Higgins as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Kiribati.

“New Zealand and Kiribati have a strong relationship and we work closely in areas of trade and investment, fisheries cooperation, and support for maritime surveillance and search and rescue,” Mr McCully says.

“The High Commissioner will be responsible for overseeing New Zealand’s aid programme which will total around $29 million this financial year.

“Approximately half of Kiribati’s population live in South Tarawa where New Zealand is working to address the impacts of overcrowding, and improving waste management and water and sanitation.

“New Zealand is also supporting economic development on Kiritimati Island through major investments in aviation infrastructure and renewable energy,” Mr McCully says.

Don Higgins has previous experience working across the Pacific, and most recently was an Advisor to the Administrator of Tokelau.
