Iwi radio will receive an extra $12 million over the next four years to support the operational costs of the 21 stations currently funded by Te Mangai Pāho and to assess the feasibility of expanding the iwi radio network, Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says.

“Since its inception in the mid-1980s, iwi radio has played a critical role in making our reo available to whanau in their homes, in their cars, and in a range of settings,” Dr Sharples says.

“Through new technology, they connect our whanau, hapu and iwi all over the world to the news and the happenings in our home towns and in our communities.

“These radio stations have become vibrant hubs for our iwi, as they present korero about what is happening in communities, in our iwi affairs, and among our people.

“With this new investment, we can expect to see more Māori language content and more quality programming to support our whanau in their engagement with te reo.

“The additional $12 million over four years increases the Government’s total commitment to iwi radio to $13.7 million in operating funds per year.”

Budget 2014 also provides an additional $1.5 million of operating funding over four years to support Te Mangai Pāho to archive historic Māori language programming.

“Over many years, iwi radio and television producers have accumulated a wonderful library of programmes,” Dr Sharples says. “There are many interviews of kaumatua who are no longer with us, or broadcasts from major hui. These recordings are taonga, and it’s important that we protect and preserve them.”

These initiatives support Māori community development as well as Māori language revitalisation efforts.
