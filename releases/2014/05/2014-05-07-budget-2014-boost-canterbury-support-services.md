The Government is continuing to invest in psychosocial services and support for temporary accommodation services in Canterbury, Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says.

“Canterbury people have been incredibly resilient, but the pressures associated with the rebuild and temporary accommodation arrangements continue to be major stresses for many,” she says.

“New operating funding of $13.5 million over the next four years will see the continuation of the Earthquake Coordination Service, including counselling services and the Canterbury 0800 support phone line.

“We’re expecting that the new money will provide coordination support for up to 5,000 households and support 240 new people a month through counselling services.  It is estimated that the 0800 Canterbury support line will handle around 12,850 calls.

“Part of the funding will also support NGOs in implementing key elements of the draft ‘Community in Mind’ Strategy that outlines what is needed to support people’s psychosocial wellbeing in Canterbury over the next four years,” Mrs Bennett says. 

“The 0800 Canterbury support line receives up to 500 calls a month, while Earthquake support coordinators helped around 2,000 families to date in 2013/14.

“The Government is also investing $2.3 million in new operating funding over the next two years to provide continued case management support for Cantabrians to help them manage the challenges associated with temporary accommodation as a result of the rebuilding.

“Currently around 1,000 Canterbury families receive Temporary Accommodation Assistance (TAA), with weekly payments ranging from $180 to $330 depending on household size.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service (CETAS) anticipates that demand for its matching and placement service will peak this year alongside more applications for TAA payments.

“Today’s announcement ensures on-going investment in the financial and psychosocial wellbeing of Canterbury people and their families,” says Mrs Bennett.
