Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today released the Government's first draft National Statement of Science Investment (NSSI), which sets out the current settings and proposed future priorities for Government’s science investment, for public feedback.

“The Government’s science investment will be almost $1.5 billion in 2015/16, a figure which has grown by more than 70 per cent across government since 2007/08. To capitalise on opportunities to increase the value and effectiveness of this investment, the draft NSSI proposes a series of key priorities for action over the next five to 10 years,” Mr Joyce says.

“This government has introduced a number of new initiatives including the National Science Challenges, Callaghan Innovation and the Primary Growth Partnerships. Now is a good time for a stocktake on the overall shape of the science system to consider where the next investments should be made.”

The draft NSSI reviews the entire cross-government investment in research and development. It also proposes potential reforms to the sector-specific research funds administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

“We’re after feedback from everybody who has an interest in the science system to assist us in focusing our efforts. We want a broad conversation about the overall direction of Government’s science investment and the balance of that spend, between investigator-led, mission-led, and business-led research,” Mr Joyce says.

“It is also important that we further develop the evaluation framework for our science investment; and not just focus on the amount invested. The draft NSSI proposes a number of measures in this regard.

“It’s vital our science system can respond to the unique economic, environmental and cultural challenges that New Zealand faces now and in the future.

“Over the next five to 10 years, the science system will be increasingly prominent as it both shapes and is shaped by an economy that is increasingly innovation-led, and New Zealanders who are more engaged with science in their daily lives than ever before.

“New Zealand is now making a much bigger investment in science than it was six years ago. Through the NSSI we expect to maximise the critical contribution of science to New Zealand’s economic growth, prosperity, and the wellbeing of all New Zealanders.”
