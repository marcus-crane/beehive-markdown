Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman will travel to Italy today for the 70th anniversary commemorations of the battles of Monte Cassino this weekend.

“I am looking forward to joining the 38 New Zealand veterans of the Italian campaign to pay our respects to those who paid the ultimate price whilst serving their country,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is important that we remember and honour those who served in Italy during the Second World War. Monte Cassino was one of the most significant battles New Zealand forces were involved in during the Italian campaign, and there were heavy casualties on both sides.”

A number of commemorative events and remembrance services will take place during 17-19 May 2014, including a visit to the battle sites and services at the Cassino Railway Station, and the Cassino Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.

Dignitaries attending a number of the events include, His Royal Highness, Prince Harry, and the Governor-General, Lieutenant General The Right Honourable Sir Jerry Mateparae.
