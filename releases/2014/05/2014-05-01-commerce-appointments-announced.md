Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced appointments to the Commerce Commission and Financial Markets Authority (FMA).

Anna Rawlings joins the Commerce Commission in early June and will bring extensive experience in competition law, industry regulation, and consumer protection. 

“Her appointment is particularly timely given changes to consumer legislation which the Commission will be implementing,” says Mr Foss. 

The Minister also welcomed the reappointments of Shelley Cave and Murray Jack, and the appointment of Dr Arthur Grimes from associate to member, to the FMA.

“They have been with the FMA since its establishment in 2011, and I am pleased that the Governor-General concurred with my recommendation for their reappointment,” says Mr Foss. “They will continue to bring strong institutional knowledge and their respective areas of expertise to the board.”

The Minister also thanked retiring member Anita Mazzoleni for her service on the Commerce Commission, and thanked Colin Giffney and Bruce Sheppard for their service on the FMA board. 

**Background – new appointment**

**Anna Rawlings** is a partner at Minter Ellison Rudd Watts in Auckland.  She has a strong background in cross-disciplinary competition and regulatory law with a practice specialising in industry regulation, consumer protection and marketing law.
