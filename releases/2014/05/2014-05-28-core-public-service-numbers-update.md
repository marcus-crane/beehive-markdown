State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest statistics on core government administration show a reduction to 65 positions below the cap.

“The Government is delivering better public services at the same time as shifting resources from administration to frontline services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Numbers in the core public service drastically escalated under the previous Labour Government. The National-led Government introduced a cap on core government administration in 2009, and we lowered it again in 2012. We continue to remain below the cap of 36,475 full-time equivalent positions.

“As at 31 December 2013, there were 36,410 full-time equivalent positions in core government administration. This update shows a general decrease in vacancies across agencies, despite the predicted seasonal increase at the Department of Conservation during summer, and the Ministry of Social Development’s seasonal workforce for StudyLink.

“The cap on core government administration positions remains a useful tool, combined with a focus on departmental baselines and the Better Public Services initiative, to deliver better public services for New Zealanders.

“The Government continues to make good progress in our 10 Better Public Services Results areas, and the Kiwis Count survey shows satisfaction and trust in our public service remains high.”

Core government administration positions include all public service departments (excluding the Community Probation and Psychological Service and Prison Service sections of the Department of Corrections, and the Child Youth and Family, and Work and Income sections of the Ministry of Social Development) and five selected Crown entities: Housing NZ Corporation, NZ Qualifications Authority, NZ Transport Agency, NZ Trade and Enterprise, and the Tertiary Education Commission.
