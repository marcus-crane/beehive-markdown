Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman has launched *‘What did you do in the war, Grandy?’* a competition for New Zealand school students sponsored by the New Zealand Society of Genealogists.

“This competition represents a great opportunity for families to continue the momentum generated by Anzac Day,” says Dr Coleman. 

“With so many younger people taking part in Anzac Day services and learning about those who served their country, parents and grandparents can help teach their children about their own ancestors and encourage them to submit their stories.”

Students can submit either a poster or a written piece outlining their ancestor’s contribution at home or overseas, in any branch of the forces, in any country. 

The long lead-in time, with entries closing on Armistice Day, gives students and their families time to work together to explore the roles family members played during times of war or to use material they have produced at school.
