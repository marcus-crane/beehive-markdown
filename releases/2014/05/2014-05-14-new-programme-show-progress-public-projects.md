Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the *Public Sector Rebuild Programme of Work* launched today by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) will keep people updated on the progress of the many public sector projects in Christchurch.

“With over $15 billion committed by the Government to the Christchurch rebuild there are clearly a lot of major projects underway, and with so much going on it can be difficult to keep track of it all,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The programme of work provides a snapshot of projects and current timelines on a range of public sector developments, from anchor projects in the central city such as the Convention Centre Precinct and Bus Interchange, through to new school builds and the redevelopment of Christchurch Hospital.

“The construction sector and investors have asked for this information and we are now able to provide it in one place.

“It is available online and will be regularly updated. 

“This is part of formalising a coordinated approach across the whole public sector rebuild, to ensure we keep stakeholders and the wider public updated on progress, utilise best practise and share experience and expertise between agencies.

“This approach will help suppliers gear up to meet demand ahead of time, and give confidence to the private sector to invest in Christchurch in the knowledge that the public sector is committed to the rebuild and is pushing ahead with its work.

“We’ve listened to stakeholders within and outside of Canterbury about the need to provide visibility and transparency on our work programme, and to update them as things change, and we hope they find this resource beneficial,” Mr Brownlee says.
