The Hon. Tariana Turia will represent New Zealand at the *2014 Global Summit of Women in Paris* and at the United Nations on Disability Issues. Minister Turia has left for London this week for a series of meetings and site visits with representatives from Government and the community in areas of housing, inequality and family violence prevention.

Minister Turia will visit the *East Thames Housing Association* - an East London housing group and the *Newham Asian Womens’ Project* that provides support for victims of domestic violence. Minister Turia will also be a guest speaker at the *2014 London Gangs Summit* – a forum focused on reducing gang crime.

The London leg of the trip will include visits with an organisation of young women from *MsUnderstood* - a group that aims to improve local and national responses to young people’s experiences of gender inequality. The Minister will also visit with two other groups - *Rewind Reframe* who challenge racist and sexist music videos and *Imkaan,* a black feminist organisation dedicated to addressing violence against women and girls.

During her time in London trip Minister Turia will visit with the Deputy Mayor of London, Stephen Greenhalgh and with officials from the *Homes and Community Agency* as well as with representatives from the *Women and Girls’ Network* which offers counselling, support and advice for women who have been affected by sexual and domestic violence.

“Family violence and gender inequality are global issues. The impact of these inequalities on the health and well-being of families in London are complex.  I look forward to meeting with these groups, to learn about their experiences and share our Whānau Ora approach to health and well-being and family violence prevention,” says Minister Turia.

Minister Turia will also represent New Zealand at two international forums in France and New York. The Minister will attend the *2014 Global Summit of Women* in Paris to represent New Zealand at the ministerial meeting where she will table New Zealand’s country initiative, ‘Women in Demand.’ The ministerial meeting is a roundtable meeting of women government ministers who will table their countries initiative on public-private partnerships for advancing the economic opportunities for women and girls.

Minister Turia will also travel to New York to the United Nations to deliver New Zealand’s national statement at the meeting of the *Conference of States Parties, on the Convention of the Rights of People with Disabilities.*

“I am proud to be able to represent our country at this international forum. This is a great opportunity to share our Disability Action Plan 2014-2018 as well as *Enabling Good Lives* – an holistic approach where the disabled community take the lead in deciding what services they need and how they should be delivered so that they can live a full life and participate in their communities like every other citizen.”

The UN visit will also include a roundtable meeting co-hosted by New Zealand and the International Disability Alliance with the theme: Participation in political and public life by persons with disabilities. Minister Turia will also meet with the Special Rapporteur on Disabilities, Shuaib Chalken.

On returning home via the State of Hawaii, Minister Turia will meet with Governor Neil Abercrombie. The Hawaiian visit will include a meeting with the Waimanalo Health Center and the Queen Lil’uokalani Childrens’ Center. Minister Turia will meet  officials from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs where she will deliver a presentation on Whānau Ora. The visit will include meeting with *‘Aha Kāne* at the School of Medicine at the Department of Native Hawaiian Health - a group working to address male family violence.

“Māori share much in common with indigenous Hawaiians and our journeys to revive our language and culture and restore our health and well-being are similar. I look forward to learning what strategies they have used in restoring self-determination and sharing how Whānau Ora has worked well in our communities.”
