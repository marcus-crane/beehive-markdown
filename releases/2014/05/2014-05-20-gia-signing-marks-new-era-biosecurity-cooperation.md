The signing of the first ever Government Industry Agreement (GIA) for Biosecurity Readiness and Response Deed is a historic moment for biosecurity in New Zealand, says Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and Kiwifruit Vine Health (KVH) have signed a partnership on preparing for priority pests and diseases, and on managing them if an incursion occurs,” Mr Guy says.

“Having industry and government sitting at the table working together is the way of the future. It allows those with a direct stake in biosecurity to be involved in decision making and funding.

“This will mean better decision making and prioritising resources to where they are most needed, both to prevent incursions and in managing them if one does occur.

“Today is the start of the process, with KVH and the kiwifruit industry now developing an operational agreement for a fruit fly readiness and response programme of work.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister because it is so important in protecting our economy. We know that unwanted pests and diseases can have devastating effects on our farmers and growers.

“Today is the start of a new era and I expect other industries to come on board in time. Cabinet agreed to the GIA model late last year and since then the focus has been on progressing deed agreements between MPI and industry.

“Biosecurity is a shared responsibility for all New Zealanders. I’m pleased that industry are keen to step up and contribute their time, expertise, and resources.”
