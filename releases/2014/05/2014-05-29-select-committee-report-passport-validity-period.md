Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne has noted the Report from the Government Administration Select Committee on the validity period for New Zealand passports. The report is in response to the petition of Kyle Lockwood seeking the reintroduction of ten year passports for New Zealanders.

Mr Dunne has said previously that he was open-minded on the question of extending passport duration, and would be guided by the Select Committee’s report.

“Accordingly, I am seeking advice from the Department of Internal Affairs on the practicalities of returning to a ten-year passport validity period in addition to other possible options including the extension of the current five-year passport life to five years nine months. This latter change would at least ensure that the current five year passport is valid for that time because many countries require travellers’ passports to have six months or more validity.

“For any extension to a ten-year passport the government would need assurance that such changes would not compromise the security and integrity for which New Zealand passports are currently recognised.

“I have also asked officials to provide me with a detailed briefing on current funding approaches and options for various passport validity periods  to ensure any changes to fees cover the processing costs but are not unreasonable to applicants”’ says Mr Dunne.
