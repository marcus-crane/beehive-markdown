Drums will beat at Parliament today to celebrate Africa Day 2014 and Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins says the annual event is a strong symbol of unity and New Zealand’s diversity.

This evening Ms Collins will host diplomats, community leaders and MPs at Parliament to commemorate the 1963 founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now recognised as the Africa Union (AU).

“Africa Day celebrates efforts to help bring about an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa,” says Ms Collins.

“In New Zealand we not only celebrate a richer cultural calendar but also acknowledge the fantastic contribution Kiwis with African heritage continue to make to our communities every day.

“This Government recognises the doors that a developing African continent can open for New Zealand and the potential that such diversity brings to our shores.

"We are working to build better understanding and closer relationships among our increasingly diverse population and it’s great to see the underlying principles of Africa Day reflect this.

“Celebrations like Africa Day are a reminder that in order to strengthen unity, we first need to acknowledge the benefits of diversity.”

The African Union comprises 55 African states, with a population of more than a billion people.  Its aim is to support integration in political, economic and social issues among member states, and to represent the African continent as one within the world community.
