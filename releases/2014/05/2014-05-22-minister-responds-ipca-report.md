Police Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the release of an Independent Police Conduct Authority report on Police handling of “Roastbusters” media enquiries.

“The report confirms that there was a communication breakdown within Police,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Although not deliberate, this was disappointing and the Commissioner personally apologised to me at the time for this mistake.

“It is vital that the public, and victims, have trust and confidence in the actions of the Police, which is why they must do everything they can to provide accurate information.

“I await the outcome of the IPCA’s review of the criminal investigation, and acknowledge that it can’t be released until Operation Clover has been concluded.”
