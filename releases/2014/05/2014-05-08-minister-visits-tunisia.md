Minister of Trade and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs Tim Groser will visit Tunisia from 8-9 May - the first New Zealand Minister to do so since World War II.

As the first country to experience the "Arab Spring", Tunisia's transition period has not been without challenges,  but Tunisia  has made impressive progress in recent months, most notably with agreement on a new constitution.

Mr Groser will meet with Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki as well as the Commerce and Higher Education ministers in a programme of meetings that is expected to step up the commercial and educational ties between New Zealand and Tunisia.

Mr Groser’s visit coincides with a 50-strong 28th Māori Battalion pilgrimage to mark the 70th anniversary of the Victoria Cross posthumously awarded to Second Lieutenant Moana Ngarimu after the bloody battle of Tobaga Gap.

"Whanau of that brave band of brothers have returned here to honour their memory and to thank the people of Tunisia, in whose care our soldiers’ remains have rested safely for so many years,” Mr Groser says.
