Statistics Minister Nicky Wagner today welcomed the release of *2013 QuickStats about a place* by Statistics New Zealand for the insight the data offers into local communities.

The online tool uses a combination of census and other official statistics to give an understanding into local suburbs, cities, districts and regions across topics such as population, incomes, housing, cultural diversity, age and sex.

“The beauty of census is it offers a snapshot of New Zealand, and we can now use that data nationally and locally to help shape communities and inform decision making.

“For example, looking at the Avon Loop area unit in Christchurch you can see a marked population decrease of 27.6 per cent, which is a graphic illustration of the impact the earthquakes have had on that area.

“Data for the same area also shows 37.2 per cent of people were born overseas, compared with 22.2 percent for Christchurch City,” Ms Wagner says.

Statistics New Zealand will continue to release data from the 2013 Census during the next 12 months.
