The Government will spend $110 million of new money over the next four years to provide even more New Zealanders with elective surgery, including hip and knee replacements, Health Minister Tony Ryall says.

“Elective surgery makes a real difference to patients and their families – it reduces pain, restores independence and improves quality of life.

“This extra funding will mean even more patients will benefit from surgery, and they will get it sooner than they have in the past.

“The new funding includes $10 million over four years for bariatric surgery. As a result of this funding, more than 120 people will receive bariatric surgery and follow-up care each year.

“This National-led Government has provided record numbers of New Zealanders with the operations they need, and provided it to them faster than before.

“Over the past five years, the number of patients receiving elective surgery has lifted from 118,000 in 2008 to 158,000 in 2013 – 40,000 more patients are now receiving elective surgery each year.

“We want even more New Zealanders to benefit from elective surgery, and this extra funding will allow us to do this,” Mr Ryall says.
