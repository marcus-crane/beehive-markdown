Budget 2014 provides $300,000 to accelerate the Open Government Data and Information Programme over the next two years, Land Information Minister Michael Woodhouse says.

The programme, which is led by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), is Action 13 of the government’s ICT Strategy and Action Plan.

“The funding will see LINZ accelerate work with public-sector agencies to focus their efforts on supplying and releasing public data that people want to reuse,’’ Mr Woodhouse says.

“It will also allow closer collaboration with users of government-held data to understand how they use it, and what economic and social impact their reuse has had.

“In particular, the programme will look at new tools, services and applications using public data, efficiencies gained by agencies using other agencies’ data, and how data reuse contributed to better public services.’’

The funding will also maintain the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework and provide support to Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand to administer up-to-date Creative Commons licenses.

“Releasing high-value public data for reuse under Creative Commons licenses means it can be reused by anyone. This creates cost savings for the public sector and generates economic benefits for the private sector.’’

New operating expenditure of $200,000 will fund work in 2014/15, and $100,000 in 2015/16.
