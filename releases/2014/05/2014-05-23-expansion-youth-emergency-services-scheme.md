Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye has today announced an additional $200,000 in funding to expand the Youth in Emergency Services (YES) programme. 

“Following the Rotorua pilot at the start of 2013 I announced the YES programme would be extended to six locations, in areas such as Alexandra and Kaikoura. I understand that these programmes have received positive feedback from the coordinators, service volunteers, and young participants,” Ms Kaye says.

“I am pleased to confirm that the programme has been extended to fund a further 20 New Zealand communities between 2014 and 2016.”

To date over 90 per cent of participants reported they have acquired new skills and knowledge and are better prepared for an emergency.  They also reported an increased connection to their community and intend to participate in voluntary activity.

“I have been continually impressed with the young people who have participated in the Youth in Emergency Services programme. This project gives young New Zealanders an opportunity to give back to their communities and see first-hand the outstanding job that our emergency services do,” Ms Kaye says.

“They get to learn from some of our most dedicated emergency services personnel including representatives from Civil Defence Emergency Management, fire brigades, ambulance and search and rescue.

“By getting young people to participate in a range of emergency services, we also strengthen the capability of those emergency services and give young people opportunities to show leadership in their communities,” Ms Kaye says.
