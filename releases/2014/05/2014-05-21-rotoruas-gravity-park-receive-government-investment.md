The Government’s Tourism Growth Partnership is investing in Rotorua’s Skyline Gravity Park to upgrade its mountain bike tracks, Associate Tourism Minister Todd McClay announced today.

Skyline’s proposal involves upgrading Gravity Park’s tracks to UCI racing standards, which will help Rotorua target major international mountain bike events.

“The Government’s Tourism Growth Partnership is funding $225,000 in addition to the $225,000 invested into the project by the Skyline Gravity Park,” Mr McClay says.

“The Gravity Park will be a world class downhill mountain bike trail system capable of hosting international events.”

“The Park will provide mountain bike enthusiasts with up to 12 kilometres of trails, while dedicated gondola cabins designed to take up to four bikes and riders per trip will create capacity of 3,000 downhill runs per day.”

“This will add a truly world-class facility to New Zealand’s mountain biking offering and further leverage the national biking trails network.”

“Global trends in bike tourism have created a real opportunity to get more Australian, European and North American riders to Rotorua.” 

Each Tourism Growth Partnership project is a joint investment between the Crown and industry. Qualifying contributions from applicants must be equal to or greater than the Crown’s investment.

“The Tourism Growth Partnership helps drive the innovative change needed to overcome blocks to growth in our tourism sector. We need to lift the value of international tourism to help grow New Zealand and create jobs in communities such as Rotorua.”

“The Government’s investment in the Gravity Park is a significant boost to the Rotorua tourism industry and the local economy,” Mr McClay says.

Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government has made $32 million available over four years to support innovative projects that will create new opportunities and overcome barriers to growth in the tourism sector.
