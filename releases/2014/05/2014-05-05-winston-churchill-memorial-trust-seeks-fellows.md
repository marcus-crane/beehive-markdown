Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is calling for applications for the 2015 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships.

“This is the 50th anniversary of the fellowship scheme established to honour Sir Winston Churchill who believed world peace and greater international understanding could be promoted through ordinary people travelling to other countries and experiencing other cultures,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“These Fellowships provide New Zealanders with the opportunity to travel overseas to learn and share ideas that will benefit themselves, and the wider community.”

Since 1965 over 800 New Zealanders have taken up this unique opportunity, this year, up to fifteen fellowships will be awarded.

This year’s fellows are researching a wide variety of topics from education and social welfare, to health, agriculture, conservation and technology.

For example, Juliet Arnott from Christchurch is investigating wood waste in England, Italy and the Netherlands.  Aucklander Haley Hooper, is looking at youth facilities and how the architecture has developed and evolved in China, Denmark, France, Spain and Thailand. While Elizabeth Soal from Oamaru, is investigating Canadian approaches to sustainable water management.

“Applications for fellowships are encouraged from across the breadth of New Zealand locations, cultures and fields of work,” says Mrs Goodhew.

Applications close 31 July 2014, with the successful applicants to be announced in late October 2014. For an application form or for further information about the Trust visit [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz)  or call 0800 824 824.
