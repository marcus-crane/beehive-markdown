Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the reappointment of the Honourable Justice Sir Grant Hammond as President of the Law Commission.

“I’m pleased to announce the reappointment of Sir Grant Hammond as the President of the Law Commission for a further two years’ term from 15 May 2014,” says Ms Collins.

“Sir Grant has been an outstanding leader of the Law Commission during his first term and it’s fantastic that he’s able to continue this leadership for a further two years.”

Sir Grant was appointed a Judge of the High Court in 1992 and of the Court of Appeal in January 2004 before taking up his role as President of the Law Commission in late 2010.

The Law Commission is an independent Crown entity established by the Law Commission Act 1985. Its purpose, as set out in its founding legislation, is to promote the systematic review, reform and development of the law of New Zealand and to advise the responsible Minister and government agencies on ways in which the New Zealand law can be made as understandable and accessible as is practicable.
