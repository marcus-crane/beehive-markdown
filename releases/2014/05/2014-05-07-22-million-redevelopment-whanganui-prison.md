Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has marked the $22 million redevelopment at Whanganui Prison with the official opening of the revamped administration building and the start of upgrades to the prison’s East and West wings.

The work is part of upgrades to six prisons around the country costing $87 million.

The administration building includes a new Audio Visual Link (AVL) facility which removes any risks associated with prisoner transport by allowing prisoners to make court appearances without leaving the secure facility.

The building also features new programme rooms where staff will deliver literacy, numeracy, computing and job-seeking programmes to remand prisoners.

Work on the East and West Wing projects includes security upgrades, construction of secure staff bases, earthquake strengthening, cell hardening, and additional exercise yards with increased security.

“The $22 million redevelopment of Whanganui Prison is important in enhancing safety and security at the facility, and also to deliver rehabilitation programmes to support our target of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The vast majority of prisoners will be released and we don’t want them to create more victims and end up back in jail. By giving them access to drug and alcohol programmes, education and employment skills training we can reduce their chances of reoffending. 

“The construction company involved in the Whanganui Prison redevelopment is involving suitably skilled prisoners on Release-to-Work on the project, which will give them valuable training to assist with their integration back into the community.” 

The East and West Wing Prison Development Project is due to be completed by August 2015.
