Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye is inviting civil defence agencies, other organisations and the public to make written submissions on the draft revised National Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Plan from today.

“The National CDEM Plan is required by law, and sets out the hazards and risks to be managed at the national level. It also sets out the civil defence emergency management roles and responsibilities of central government, CDEM Groups and other agencies such as lifeline utilities, emergency services and non-government organisations,” Ms Kaye says.

The current National CDEM Plan has been in force since 1 July 2006. Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act, the Plan must be reviewed every five years.

The review of the Plan was underway at the time of the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. This meant that the review was delayed by the need for agencies to respond to the earthquakes.  Several reviews of the response were undertaken to further ensure that New Zealand’s CDEM arrangements are optimal, and in keeping with international best practice.

“It is important that we do not allow ourselves to become complacent.  The review has ensured that our arrangements are robust, current and well understood by the agencies responsible for their delivery,” Ms Kaye says.

“I have chosen to open this consultation from Kaiapoi today in recognition of the significant impact that the earthquakes had on our communities.

“As a result of the Christchurch earthquakes, the draft Plan is now stronger, and includes key recommendations from the independent reviews that have been held. Changes include strengthening areas of the draft Plan such as welfare arrangements, the roles and responsibilities of key agencies, and post-disaster building management.”

The draft revised Plan released today incorporates feedback from agencies with arrangements in the Plan, such as emergency services, lifeline utilities and central and local government.

“I would like to thank the many agencies who have been involved this work. I am confident that draft revised Plan is a much improved and comprehensive document as a result of their hard work,” Ms Kaye says.

“Our ability to recover from a major emergency will be greatly enhanced by the revised plan.

“Now is the time for all organisations and the public to have their say on the draft revised National CDEM Plan.”

Consultation is open from today, 23 May, until 5pm 25 July 2014. The draft revised National CDEM Plan, a summary of amendments, and the submission form can be found at [www.civildefence.govt.nz](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz)
