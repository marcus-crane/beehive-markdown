Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the recipients of the Youth Week 2014 Awards.

“It is truly impressive to see the difference and change that these award recipients have brought about in their communities,” Ms Kaye says.

Youth Week runs from 17 May – 25 May. Community organisations across the country have been planning their own Youth Week events. Many of these are facilitated by funding grants through Ara Taiohi, who are also administering Youth Week.

“Youth Week is a great opportunity to recognise, support and celebrate the significant contribution and achievements of youth in our communities.

“The theme of Youth Week this year encourages youth to ‘Be the Change’ that they want to see in our society. In order for youth to create change, they need support and praise from mentors in their communities. We need to really value the diversity of our young people in New Zealand.

“I recently created the annual Youth Week Awards to recognise and celebrate young people aged 12 – 24 who have contributed to their community in a significant way.

Over one hundred nominations were received that recognised a wide range of activities young people have been involved in that benefited both their communities and other young people. 24 of these nominees will receive Youth Week Awards. Examples of activities that award recipients have been involved in include; leading and advocating for youth mental health initiatives, coaching and mentoring young basketball players, organising anti-bullying activities and organising events for youth in a rural community.

“I am really pleased with the number and quality of nominations that were received. The recipients of the awards were selected by the Ministry of Youth Development’s youth advisory group. 

There are 24 recipients of a Youth Week Award across four categories; Change Maker, Leadership, Giving Back and Working for Youth.

Tonight, Members of Parliament will attend a function at Parliament to recognize and celebrate the success of the nominees and award recipients.

“We already know that there are many young people making positive contributions in their communities. I hope that by recognizing these young people tonight, they may inspire others to do the same,” Ms Kaye says.
