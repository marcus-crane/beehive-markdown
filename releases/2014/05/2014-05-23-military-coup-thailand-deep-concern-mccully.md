Foreign Minister Murray McCully has expressed deep concern at the news of a military coup in Thailand and the suspension of the constitution.

"It is difficult to see how military rule will ease Thailand's current political crisis. The detention of political leaders is unacceptable," Mr McCully says.

"New Zealand calls for an early return to democracy in Thailand, and for full restoration of the rule of law and fundamental human rights - including press freedoms and the freedom of association.

"We urge the military to set a clear timetable for elections, and for all parties to resolve their differences through peaceful dialogue."

New Zealanders travelling to or residing in Thailand are encouraged to monitor developments, avoid any protests, and register on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Safetravel website [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz)
