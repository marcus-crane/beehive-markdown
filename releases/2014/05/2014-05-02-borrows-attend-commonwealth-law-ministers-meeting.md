Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows will represent New Zealand at the Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting, taking place in Gaborone, Botswana next week.

“The Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting is a great opportunity to discuss a range of law and order issues with our counterparts in the Commonwealth,” says Mr Borrows.

“With the legal systems of most Commonwealth countries sharing common roots, there is much we can learn from the way our related legal systems have evolved and faced similar challenges in different ways.

“It is also an important opportunity for us to maintain our strong links with other Commonwealth countries, maintaining and building on our historic friendships.”

The Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting occurs triennially, and this meeting has a particular focus on *Consolidating the rule of law and human rights in the Commonwealth*.

“This year’s meeting includes a broad range of topics, such as enhancing international civil legal co-operation between Commonwealth members, international efforts to fight corruption and cyber-crime, and the role of victims in the justice system.

“It is a wide-ranging agenda, with plenty of areas where New Zealand can both contribute to and learn from the conversation.”

Mr Borrows will return to New Zealand on Sunday 11 May.
