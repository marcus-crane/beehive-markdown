A pilot programme supporting families at risk of serious harm from domestic abuse to stay safely in their own homes will be extended for 12 months, Justice Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Ms Collins says the Government will invest $500,000 to extend the safe@home service for one year from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. This funding is part of an overall spend of $5.9 million on grants and services for victims of serious crime funded through the Offender Levy.

“Safe@home has so far helped keep over 400 families safe from domestic abuse without them having to leave their own homes,” Ms Collins says.

“As a result vulnerable women and children avoid the trauma of having to relocate and are instead supported to stay where their established support networks such as neighbours and school friends are.”

Safe@home, delivered by Auckland charity Shine and supported by the Government, helps make victims’ homes safer from attack by replacing glass panelled doors with solid doors, installing security lights and monitored personal alarms, replacing locks and repairing broken windows.

The safe@home service is currently offered in Auckland City, North Shore, Counties Manukau, Tauranga and Christchurch. Today’s announcement will see an extra 154 extra families benefit from the service.

Ms Collins says the $500,000 investment supports the Government’s commitment to making sure victims remain at the heart of our criminal justice system.

“By making homes safer and more secure we are empowering these families and helping to keep them safe from continued violence.”
