Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is reminding road users to take care and drive to the conditions over Queen’s Birthday weekend.

“As we come into the winter months, driving conditions can get more challenging. I encourage all those travelling this weekend to slow down and avoid distractions so that everyone makes it to their destination safely,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The official Queen’s Birthday holiday period for 2014 will begin at 4pm tomorrow and end at 6am on Tuesday 3 June. Last year the Queen’s Birthday weekend road toll was zero, the lowest ever.

The most common factors contributing to the 64 reported injury crashes over Queen’s Birthday 2013 were:

- failing to give way
- losing control
- inattention
- alcohol
- fatigue
- travelling too fast for conditions

This week Police launched an initiative called ‘Make it to Monday’ for the long weekend and will again be enforcing a reduced speed tolerance of no more than 4km/h over all permanently posted speed limits.

“Over the past three years, on average, two people die and 79 people are injured every weekend as a result of road crashes. This is too high a price to pay. As part of our Safer Journeys strategy we will continue to strengthen all parts of the road system to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries.’’
