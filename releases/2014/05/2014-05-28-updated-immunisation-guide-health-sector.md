Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today launched an updated immunisations reference guide for health professionals.

“The Immunisation Handbook contains the latest best practice advice about diseases and the vaccines available to prevent them,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Having that information at hand helps health professionals safely and confidently deliver immunisation services to the people they care for.”

The new Handbook includes information about the additional vaccines that will be funded from 1 July 2014, such as the rotavirus vaccine.

The launch of the Immunisation Handbook also marks the 10th anniversary of the National Immunisation Register (NIR).

A quiet success story, the NIR is now a vital part of our health infrastructure allowing us to measure and track immunisation coverage.

“Increasing immunisation has been a priority for this Government.  Since 2007 we have seen immunisation rates rise considerably, to 93 percent for two year olds and 91 percent of eight month olds,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Both the Immunisation Handbook and the NIR are important tools in ensuring every child has access to the protection they are entitled to.”

The Immunisation Handbook is now in its sixth edition, and for the first time will also be available as an e-book.

Copies of the Immunisation Handbook are being sent to health professionals, and will also be available for download from the Ministry of Health website.
