Health Minister Tony Ryall today visited Karori Medical Centre in Wellington to view a new model of care improving health outcomes for diabetes patients in their local GP clinic.

“Capital and Coast DHB and Karori Medical Centre have developed a nurse practice partnership which has been running since May 2012,” says Mr Ryall.

“The clinic is giving local diabetes patients the tools and knowledge to better manage their condition in a more convenient and comfortable setting. Of the 55 patients identified who had a high average glucose level, over half have seen a reduction to a more manageable level,” says Mr Ryall.

Several practices around the Greater Wellington region are now running similar clinics, and Capital and Coast DHB are hoping implementing this model across all practices in the near future.

“A patient told me that he now feels more in control of managing his diabetes. Advice from his nurse is now just a short walk or call away, and he feels less tired and has more get-up-and-go,” says Mr Ryall.

“The practice’s nurses have gained valuable experience working in partnership with a diabetes nurse specialist at Wellington Hospital, who links them in with the national diabetes knowledge and skills framework, and actively supports them to manage patients at the practice level,” says Mr Ryall.

Mr Ryall says this model is part of the government’s aim to develop localised, integrated approaches to improving diabetes services for New Zealanders. 

“Last year the government committed an additional $12.4 million over four years to develop better services for people with diabetes,” says Mr Ryall.

“The government asked DHBs and primary care to work together to design nurse-led clinics, improve practice management systems, establish electronic referral pathways to specialist services, and up skill primary care staff in the use of these tools,” says Mr Ryall.
