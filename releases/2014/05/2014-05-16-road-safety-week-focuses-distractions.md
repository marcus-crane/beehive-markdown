Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse is reminding drivers to keep focused while behind the wheel this Road Safety Week.

“The road is a complex environment and requires our full concentration. When we’re out on the road, it’s very easy to be distracted by a phone, music, or even other people. It’s important to remember that a moment’s inattention can have serious consequences,” Mr Woodhouse says.

According to Ministry of Transport statistics, distraction is a factor in around 10 percent of both fatal and serious injury crashes. The total social cost of crashes involving distraction was about $315 million in 2012.

“Saving lives and preventing injuries on our roads is everyone’s responsibility. I’m pleased to see that schools, businesses and community groups are involved in running events throughout Road Safety Week.’’

Road Safety Week starts this Monday and ends on 26 May. It is promoted by road safety charity Brake NZ with the support of government agencies. The theme of the week for 2014 is ‘Tune in to road safety’.

“Every road death is a huge loss to families, friends and the wider community. The high road toll in April shows us what happens when road users don’t concentrate on the basics.’’
