Associate Tourism Minister Todd McClay has described the tourism industry as being in a very confident mood ahead of the annual TRENZ industry showcase in Auckland next week.

“New Zealand is well and truly leading the way when it comes to the bounce-back of international visitors since the Global Financial Crisis,” says Mr McClay.

"Last week I met with a number of key representatives of the British travel industry in London. Many of those there, particularly the tour facilitators, expressed a real sense of optimism about the British market and the ongoing success of the promotion of New Zealand as a visitor destination.”

After years of fairly stagnant holiday visitor numbers from the UK, we are starting to see the numbers increase again – up four per cent for the year ended March 2014.

“14 buyers and one media delegate from the UK will be attending TRENZ this year, underlining just how far-reaching this event has become.”

Mr McClay said that overall international visitor arrivals were up by 5 per cent to nearly 2.8 million to March 2014, and the previous month saw the highest one-year growth rate in a decade, at 7.3 per cent.

“A number of factors have contributed to this trend including the innovation and nimbleness of our tourism sector and the significant investment in tourism, particularly tourism promotion by this Government.”

As part of Budget 2013 the Government committed an additional $158 million over four years into Tourism. This funding has provided a boost in marketing New Zealand to the world.

“The recent NZIER report shows that within our five major tourism markets direct promotion is a significant factor in people’s decisions to come to New Zealand.”

“It is no coincidence that the tourism sector is in good heart, in 2008 the Prime Minister elevated the status of tourism by picking up the portfolio himself, subsequent investment is producing the intended results and our innovative sector is taking full advantage of that.”

“I look forward to supporting our tourism industry and attending TRENZ next week,” says Mr McClay.
