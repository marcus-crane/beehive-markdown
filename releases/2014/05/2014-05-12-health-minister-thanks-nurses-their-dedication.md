Health Minister Tony Ryall today acknowledged the country’s nurses for their dedication, compassion and professionalism.

Mr Ryall said International Nurses Day is a time to reflect on the round-the-clock care and support nurses provide to patients and their families.

International Nurses Day is celebrated around the world on May 12 – the birthday of the world’s most famous nurse, Florence Nightingale.

“As I visit hospitals around the country, I am struck by the qualities of dedication, compassion and, of course, clinical excellence which our nurses possess,” says Mr Ryall.

“Nurses are at the frontline of care and are contributing to better experiences for patients and families.

“For example, nurses working in GP practices are now running clinics for diabetes patients to help them manage their health better. Nearly 60 cancer nurse coordinators have been employed throughout the country to support cancer patients and their families. And we have more nurses working in schools to provide health advice to students.

“Latest Ministry of Health information shows there are 3,200 more nurses and midwives employed by district health boards than when this National-led Government was elected.

“More than 21,500 nurses and midwives are now working in our public hospitals and in the community across the country,” says Mr Ryall.

The theme of this year’s International Nurses Day is Nurses: A Force for Change – A Vital Resource for Health.
