Eight inaugural members have been appointed to the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Board, established by the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“I am delighted to announce the new Board appointees,” Mr Finlayson said. “Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga will ensure continued heritage protection, remove red-tape and recognise the heritage needs of New Zealanders.”

The Act, which was given assent this week, reforms the governance of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in line with its status as a Crown entity. It completes the government’s programme of legislative reform of the cultural sector and replaces the Historic Places Act 1993. The statutory name of the Historic Places Trust has changed to Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga.

*Note on the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014:*

The Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act reforms the governance of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in line with its status as a Crown entity and streamlines the bureaucracy needed to ensure heritage protection. The statutory name of the Historic Places Trust has been changed to Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga.

The Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 replaces the Historic Places Act 1993 and streamlines the method of obtaining archaeological authorities, bringing the timeframe for consenting in line with the Resource Management Act.

It simplifies and speeds up the archaeological consenting procedure, reducing the red-tape burden on property owners while ensuring appropriate protection for heritage. It balances the important considerations of heritage protection, public safety and landowners’ rights.

The Act also brings the structure of the re-named Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga in line with its status as a Crown entity. An eight-member Board is established by Ministerial appointment. This will allow community based advocacy groups to campaign freely without the constraints of being part of a Crown entity, as had been the case under the Historic Places Trust’s local branch structure.

The existing Māori Heritage Council is retained in its current size and form. Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga will work in consultation with the council on all applications affecting sites of interest to Māori.

The Act introduces a number of measures, including an emergency archaeological authority in the wake of natural disasters such as earthquakes, to strike a sensible balance that minimises hold-ups while still protecting vulnerable heritage.

A National Historic Landmarks list will be established to set national priorities for heritage conservation and recognise the most important historic landmarks and precincts.
