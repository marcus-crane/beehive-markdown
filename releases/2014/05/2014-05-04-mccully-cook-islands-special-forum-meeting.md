Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to the Cook Islands tomorrow to attend the Pacific Islands Forum Special Leaders’ Meeting on the Pacific Plan on behalf of the Prime Minister.

“The Pacific Plan is the Forum’s guiding strategy for stimulating economic growth and promoting good governance and security in the Pacific,” Mr McCully says.

“A review of the Pacific Plan has recently been completed and the Special Leaders’ Meeting in Rarotonga will consider the findings of this report.

“It is critical that the Forum continues to look at its structure and work programme to ensure it delivers the best possible results for the region.

“The Pacific Plan Review process is an opportunity to have this discussion and for Pacific leaders to consider the future of Pacific regionalism more generally,” Mr McCully says.

While in Rarotonga the Minister will also meet with Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna.
