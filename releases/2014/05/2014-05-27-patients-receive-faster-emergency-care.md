For the first time since the National Health Targets were introduced in 2009, every district health board (DHB) has achieved over 90 per cent for the shorter stays in emergency department target.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says this is great news for patients and their families.

“New Zealanders are receiving emergency care faster than ever before. Gone are the days of endless stories about patients waiting for days under bright florescent lights in emergency department corridors.

“In June 2007 the Herald reported a mother waiting four days in North Shore Hospital’s emergency department for surgery on a broken hip.

“Eleven DHBs achieved the shorter stays target this quarter. Capital & Coast DHB had the biggest improvement – with a 2 per cent increase this quarter.

“These results show this government’s focus on results for patients is working. This is about improving the quality of patient care”

The latest results also show improvements in the five other targets:

- 117,319 hip and knee replacements and other elective operations, were performed this quarter – 5 per cent more than planned
- Every patient ready for cancer treatment received it within the world gold standard of four weeks
- 91 per cent of eight-month olds were fully immunised protecting children from illnesses such as whooping cough
- For the sixth consecutive quarter the hospital better help for smokers to quit target was met and there was a 5 per cent increase for in primary care
- And there was a 5 per cent increase in the number of people having heart and diabetes checks – this increase equates to around 70,000 more checks.

“While there will always be room for improvement, overall results show continued progress on Health Targets” says Mr Ryall

A copy of the latest Health Target results is available on the Ministry of Health website.
