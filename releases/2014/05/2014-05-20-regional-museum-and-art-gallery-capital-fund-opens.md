The Regional Museums Policy fund for Capital Construction Projects is open for 2014/15 applications, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson announced today.

The fund assists regional museums and art galleries that house collections of national significance to improve access to and care of these collections through major construction projects. Applications for qualifying museum and art gallery redevelopment projects are considered on a contestable basis.

“This fund supports construction projects benefitting nationally significant collections in major museums,” Mr Finlayson said.

It is envisaged there will be around $6 million available for possible allocation to applicants.

The Regional Museums Policy for Capital Construction Projects was established in 2000. It recognises that nationally significant collections are held by key regional museums.

Past recipients include: Toitū Otago Settlers Museum ($6 million); Rotorua Museum and Art Gallery ($7.5 million); MTG, the Hawke’s Bay Museum and Art Gallery, Napier ($6 million) and the Len Lye Centre, New Plymouth ($4 million).

Applications close at 9am on Monday 30 June 2014.
