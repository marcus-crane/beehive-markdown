The Ministry of Health is investing $3 million to expand the roll out of patient portals and allow more people to securely access their health information online.

Health Minister Tony Ryall was due to make the announcement at the Practice Managers and Administrators Association Conference in Rotorua today.

“Patient portals are secure online sites which allow New Zealanders to access their personal health information and manage aspects of their health care,” says Mr Ryall.

“Patients can book appointments, order repeat medications and view their clinical information online, at any time of day, through the system.

“In addition to giving patients more control over their own health care, patient portals reduce the time general practice staff spend on administrative tasks. 

“The $3 million funding boost will be used to give practical support to general practices planning to introduce a portal.

“There are 35,000 patients from 78 general practices who currently have access to a patient portal. This investment will mean even more patients will be able to use this service,” says Mr Ryall.

The nationwide rollout of patient portals is being led by the National Health IT Board.
