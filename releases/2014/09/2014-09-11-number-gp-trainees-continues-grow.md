The number of doctors practising in New Zealand will continue to grow as record numbers of graduates have signed up for GP training next year says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Figures from the Ministry of Health show 165 graduate doctors have accepted places into the General Practice Education Programme (GPEP).

“Due to the hard work of the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Medical Council of New Zealand, and Health Workforce NZ, there has been a substantial increase in the number of junior doctors interested in becoming a GP,” says Mr Ryall.

“Continuing to grow the number of GPs working in New Zealand will help to meet the growing demand for high quality care closer to home.

“Families want and deserve access to a doctor when they need one, close to home. Increasing the number of GPs working in our communities signals the importance the government places on delivering quality healthcare in the community.

“This year 165 graduate doctors will join the general practice training scheme compared to 94 in 2008,” says Mr Ryall.

The Government has invested $22 million to provide GPEP training places. GPEP is run by the New Zealand Royal College of General Practitioners.
