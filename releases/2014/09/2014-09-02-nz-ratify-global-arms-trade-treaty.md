Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed news that New Zealand will ratify the Arms Trade Treaty - a world-first agreement aimed at regulating and controlling the trade in conventional arms.

Prime Minister John Key made the announcement when he met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Auckland this morning.

“The Arms Trade Treaty is a major step forward in global efforts to reduce the harm caused by the illicit arms trade,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand has supported the Treaty from its inception. We have also developed a model law to assist Pacific states, and small states in other regions, to implement the Treaty. 

“We will be among the first 50 states to ratify - an important milestone in terms of bringing the Treaty into force globally.

“All parties to the Treaty must adopt basic regulations and processes to control the flow of weapons across international borders. These include prohibiting the transfer of arms that may be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.

“New Zealand is internationally recognised for our role in promoting disarmament, including nuclear disarmament and we are proud to be playing a similar role in addressing the trade in conventional arms,” Mr McCully says.
