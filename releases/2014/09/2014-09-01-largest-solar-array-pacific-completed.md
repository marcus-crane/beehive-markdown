Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the completion of the Apia racecourse solar array in Samoa today.

“The 2.2 Megawatt photovoltaic array at the Apia Sports Complex will provide the highest electrical output from a single installation in the South Pacific,” says Mr McCully.

“Along with two other solar projects in Samoa it is expected meet a total of 4.5 per cent of the total energy demand in Samoa and supply approximately 4,400 households. In total New Zealand has contributed over $7.5 million towards these three projects.

“We are very pleased that construction has been completed in time for the United Nations Small Islands Developing States Conference. This provides Samoa with an opportunity to showcase the progress they are making in developing renewable energy generation.

“Clean, efficient, affordable and reliable energy services are vital to sustainable economic development. This project is just one of major solar energy developments under way in the Pacific following the 2013 Pacific Energy Summit in Auckland.

“More than 50 projects are being implemented as a result of the commitments made at the Summit. Collectively these projects are moving the Pacific closer towards 50 per cent renewable electricity,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully is currently in Apia for the third United Nations Small Islands Developing States Conference.
