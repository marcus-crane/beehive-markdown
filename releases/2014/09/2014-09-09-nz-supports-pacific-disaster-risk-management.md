Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a new partnership aimed at helping Pacific Island nations prepare for and manage natural disasters.

“The Pacific region is vulnerable to natural disasters such as tsunami, earthquakes and cyclones,” Mr McCully says.

“Over the last three years the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) have been working together with Pacific Island governments to help them prepare for natural disasters.

“This co-operation had delivered practical improvements in disaster readiness across the Pacific – including the installation of 23 tsunami warning sirens along Samoa’s south coast.

“The new Partnership Agreement between MCDEM and MFAT, builds on this investment and will enable us to support the Pacific in some new areas,” Mr McCully says.

Under the arrangement, the Ministries will share expertise, pool resources, and work together on prevention measures and rapid response to disasters in the Pacific.

“New Zealand has developed expertise, knowledge and resources that is enabling us to help other countries to be more prepared and respond to disasters,” Ms Kaye says

“The new arrangement has a focus on youth development and awareness. This is about helping Pacific nations better protect children and young people in the event of major emergencies.

“A key focus of the programme and the Government’s support is also helping Pacific Island nations strengthen their own national capability in readiness, response and recovery. We will also continue to provide expert emergency management support.

"New Zealand has a proud record of assisting countries in the Asia-Pacific region in their times of need, and this agreement is about building on that support and ensuring these nations are even more prepared,” Ms Kaye says.

The previous agreement between MCDEM and MFAT had a value of $3.1 million over three years. The total investment in the new agreement is currently being finalised.
