State-Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall has acknowledged Mark Ford following his retirement as Watercare Services chief executive.

“Mr Ford has been a great public servant over the last twenty years, and has made a lasting contribution to both the Auckland community and wider New Zealand.

“He has had a reputation for fostering strong relationships and being a steady hand in leading complex projects throughout his career, as was seen during his time as Chair of Solid Energy,” says Mr Ryall.

Mr Ford served as the Chair of Solid Energy from September 2012 to May 2014 and was part of the Better Public Services Advisory Group in 2011, and as independent chair of Christchurch Client Governance Group from 2012.
