Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced funding of $100,000 for a collaborative approach to fresh water modelling in the Wellington region.

The money was awarded to Greater Wellington Regional Council from the Government’s Community Environment Fund.

“There are so many different models available, each with its own strengths or shortcomings. This project will get all the modellers together to determine which is the most appropriate to use in specific circumstances or under specific conditions,” Ms Adams says.

Models allow councils and water users to make better predictions so they can improve their land and water management practices and target resources to tackle water management challenges.

The Government’s funding contributes to a $1.6 million project run by Greater Wellington Regional Council to establish a framework for this collaborative approach to modelling.

“The project will support a better, more community-focussed process for making water quality decisions. It will also help determine water quality limits for the Wellington region as required under the Government’s National Policy Statement for Freshwater.”

The $100,000 in funding is from a targeted round of the Government’s Community Environment Fund.

The round was aimed at activities that support key elements of the Government’s freshwater programme, including implementation of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management and regional planning and community participation in freshwater management.
