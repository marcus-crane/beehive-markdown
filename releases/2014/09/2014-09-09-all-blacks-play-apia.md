Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the announcement that the All Blacks have set a date to play Manu Samoa in Apia in 2015.

“Our shared passion for the game of rugby binds New Zealanders and Pacific people together,” Mr McCully says.

“The All Blacks playing in Apia recognises the importance of Samoa and other Pacific nations to our national side and our national game.

“This historic Test will reflect the fact that some of the best known All Blacks have Pacific heritage and Pacific people have made an enormous contribution to New Zealand rugby at all levels.

“The game on 8 July 2015 will attract fans from around the world, provide a major boost for Samoan tourism operators, and promote the game of rugby to a new generation in the Pacific,” Mr McCully says.
