Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to New York today to attend the 69th United Nations General Assembly.

“The United Nations General Assembly is the foremost meeting of countries at the highest level. It is an opportunity to ensure that the views of New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours are heard in global discussions,” says Mr McCully.

“This year’s General Assembly will address a range of pressing global issues. These include climate change at the Secretary-General’s Climate Summit, the future of sustainable development, and peace and security issues, including counterterrorism efforts.”

Minister McCully is scheduled to deliver New Zealand’s statement in the general debate on Monday 29 September.

“During the week I will be meeting with representatives from a wide range of countries to discuss New Zealand’s candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council. The vote is next month and the General Assembly is an opportunity to demonstrate our credentials and show why a small state, like New Zealand, deserves a place on the Security Council.

“In line with the caretaker convention that applies after the election I have invited the Opposition Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs to join me for part of this trip,” Mr McCully says.

While in New York Minister McCully will also attend a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, the annual meeting between Pacific Island Forum leaders and the Secretary General of the United Nations, and an event looking at the use of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council.
