Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the safe release of 45 United Nations peacekeepers from Fiji who had been detained in Syria.

“The safe release of the peacekeepers is an excellent outcome for the soldiers and their friends and family in Fiji,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand applauds the hard work from the United Nations and others to secure their safe release.

“The peacekeepers were working under the United Nations banner to maintain stability along the border between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights.

“All parties in this region must respect the inviolability of United Nations peacekeepers and their right to carry out their work on behalf of the international community,” Mr McCully says.
