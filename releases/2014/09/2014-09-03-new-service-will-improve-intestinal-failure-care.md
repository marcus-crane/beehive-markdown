Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced a new National Intestinal Failure service, costing $1 million over three years, will be established to improve the quality of care for patients suffering with intestinal failure.

Intestinal failure is a serious condition that affects a patient’s ability to keep up adequate nutrition. It is estimated there are around 300 New Zealanders who require long term intestinal care. 

“Care for people with prolonged intestinal failure is complicated – it requires long hospital stays, often weeks at a time, and multiple treatments which can include intestinal transplants,” says Mr Ryall.

“Because the number of New Zealanders with this condition is quite small, the care people receive varies across the country.

“The national service will provide more coordinated care for patients. It will be a first point of contact for doctors requiring advice on treatment options and assess patients who may benefit from an intestinal transplant.

“It will also take advantage of new technology, such as telemedicine, to connect doctors with specialists at the national hub to provide patients with the care they need closer to home,” says Mr Ryall.

The service will be overseen by a board of clinical staff and a patient advocate. Dr Stephen Streat, Clinical Director of Organ Donation New Zealand will chair the board.

The National Intestinal Failure service will operate out of Auckland City and Starship Children’s Hospitals.
