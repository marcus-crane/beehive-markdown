Pacific Island Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today encourages New Zealanders to celebrate and participate in Tuvalu Language Week. 

Tuvalu Language Week runs from 29 September to 5 October. The theme this year is *Tuvalu ko tou lagaifakalaga ke mau mai aulua foe: Your language keeps your culture and identity afloat, continue to work together.*

“This week is about showcasing Tuvalu culture, pride and the Tuvalu language in New Zealand.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“At just over 3,500 people, the Tuvalu population is one of the smaller Pacific groups in New Zealand.  Despite this, they punch above their weight and make a vibrant and unique contribution to our country.”

A range of events will take place around the country involving traditional performances, language programmes and cultural cuisine.

“Celebrating and sharing our cultural identity is essential for the wellbeing of our children, families and the wider community.  There is an exciting program of events throughout the week and I would encourage all New Zealanders to take part.” Mr Lotu-Iiga added.
