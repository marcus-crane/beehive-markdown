Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the announcement of the teams who will take part in a pilot programme to support new social enterprise start-ups.

“The successful 11 teams are organisations with social or environmental goals which use commercial models to generate income,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Ākina Foundation’s social enterprise accelerator pilot, *Launchpad*, is co-funded by the Department of Internal Affairs and Contact Energy. The final 11 teams were chosen from 134 applications.

The *Launchpad* programme will provide the final teams with business mentoring and intensive development support to get them up and running.

“The Government recognises that, by combining social goals and business methods, social enterprises have the potential to make a significant contribution to social and environmental goals and the economy,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“That’s why at the start of the year the Government invested $1.12 million over two years into a national social enterprise incubation and development service to provide expert support, resources, and one-on-one advice from bases in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

“In addition, the Government has invested $146,000 in the Launchpad accelerator pilot, alongside funding from Contact Energy.

“The Government continues to work collaboratively to create an enabling, supportive environment where enterprises can grow and attract investment.

“This is a new era within New Zealand’s community and voluntary sector and I look forward to discussions continuing between government agencies and social enterprise networks to identify ways this promising sector can grow.”
