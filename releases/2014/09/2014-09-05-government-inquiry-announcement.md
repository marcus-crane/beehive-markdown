Prime Minister John Key today announced the establishment of a Government Inquiry into allegations regarding Hon Judith Collins and a former Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Adam Feeley.

“I have determined that a full and proper Government Inquiry with full powers of inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2013 is the most appropriate course of action.”

Former High Court Judge Hon Lester Chisholm will conduct the inquiry.

Mr Chisholm is a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for his services to the Judiciary and was a member of the New Zealand Law Practitioners’ Disciplinary Tribunal.

Mr Chisholm was also recently the chair of the Board of Inquiry with the Ruataniwha dam and irrigation scheme.

The Inquiry will be established by notice in the Gazette no later than 11 September 2014.

The Terms of Reference require the findings of the inquiry to be reported to the Prime Minister no later than 28 November 2014.
