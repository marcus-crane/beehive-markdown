Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has focused on the increasing number of women entering trades as she officially opened Adult Learners’ Week, He Tangata Mātauranga.

Adult Learners’ Week was established in 1998 to raise the profile of adult learning and to celebrate the successes and achievements of those participating in Adult and Community Education.

Speaking at the week’s launch in Christchurch this evening, Mrs Goodhew said New Zealand has a strong culture of adult learning and every year half a million adults participate in learning programmes.

“This learning ranges from upskilling for a better job, preparing for further study, or improving life skills,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Today I have celebrated the increased involvement of women in trades in Canterbury, as a great example of adult learning.”

Over the last year the government, through the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, has worked with CPIT, Ngai Tahu, the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce, SCIRT and Canterbury organisations to increase women’s visibility in rebuild jobs and encourage more women into trades.

“So far this year 151 women have enrolled for trades courses at CPIT, taking advantage of CPIT’s ‘women in trades’ scholarships. That’s 31 more women compared to the total intake in 2013.

“This is one example of women learning skills and creating rewarding career opportunities for themselves and their families,” Mrs Goodhew said.
