Senior Citizens Minister Jo Goodhew has announced an essay competition for primary school students aimed at understanding youth attitudes towards older people.

“To promote positive ageing, it is important to understand the attitudes and perceptions younger people have towards their elders,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The essay topic: *1914 – 2014: The greatest greats and grands of the last 100 years*, is all about inspirational or prominent older New Zealanders in the last 100 years.

“I am hoping this competition will help younger people engage with the seniors in their life, and help build their understanding of the experience and wisdom they hold.

“This is the first time such a competition is being run, and the essays will also be used to help inform the upcoming 2014 Positive Ageing Strategy Report.

“Promoting positive attitudes towards intergenerational relationships is an important part of ensuring people of all ages are connected and respected in their communities.”

The competition will run for six weeks from 1 October to coincide with the International Day of Older Persons. The winner notified in mid-November 2014. First prize will receive a book voucher for themselves, as well as a book voucher which will be donated to their school library.
