The Government will provide $150,000 to support the set-up of an e-planning system to enable efficient water allocation in Marlborough, Environment Minister Amy Adams announced today.

The funding was awarded to the Marlborough District Council from the Government’s Community Environment Fund.

“The e-planning tool will allow water users like farmers, viticulturists, horticulturists and industry to identify water demand for their property based on soil type, climate conditions and crop type,” Ms Adams says.

“Using an e-planning tool to manage water resources will allow the council to allocate water in a smart and effective way. Water is a valuable resource so it is important that we manage it as efficiently as possible.

“The tool will enable best use of water in times of drought, reduce competition between water users and provide a more simple and effective system for the community.”

The e-planning tool will also enable online applications for consents for water allocation, by automatically populating water permit applications.

“It will make it less bureaucratic for water users to get consent for water permits by providing a streamlined process.

“This e-planning tool could serve as a case study for other regions who may want to develop similar systems in their area.

The $150,000 in funding is from a round of the Government’s Community Environment Fund.

The funding round was aimed at activities that support key elements of the Government’s freshwater programme, including implementation of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management and regional planning and community participation in freshwater management.
