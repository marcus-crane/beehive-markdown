Prime Minister John Key says he stands by his statements that he did not know about Dotcom until the day before the raid took place on his property in January 2012.

An alleged email has surfaced today from 27 October 2010 between WarnerBros Kevin Tsujihara and MPAA’s Mike Ellis which has been discredited by both parties.

“The conversation allegedly reported on in the email did not take place,” Mr Key says.

“People will see this for what it is.”
