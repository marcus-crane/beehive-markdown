Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand will contribute a five person team to the Multinational Observer Group for the Fiji election.

“New Zealand is strongly supportive of Fiji’s election preparations and return to democratic rule,” Mr McCully says.

“The Multinational Observer Group will help give the international community, and the people of Fiji, confidence in the outcome of the election.

“New Zealand’s team will be led by former Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech, who is already in Fiji. He will soon be joined by four other current and former members of Parliament, Mr Rick Barker, Mr John Hayes, Dr Paul Hutchison, and Mr Ross Robertson.

“All members of the delegation have extensive knowledge of Parliamentary process and election procedures.

“The calibre of New Zealand’s election observers reflects the importance we place on Fiji holding credible elections on 17 September and our willingness to assist Fiji’s return to democracy,” Mr McCully says.
