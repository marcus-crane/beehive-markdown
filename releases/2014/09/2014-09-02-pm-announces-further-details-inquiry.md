Prime Minister John Key today announced further details on the inquiry into matters concerning former Minister Judith Collins.

“As I indicated yesterday, I intend to appoint a Government Inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2013 to investigate allegations that Ms Collins undermined the then Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Adam Feeley, during her time as Minister of Police with responsibility for the Serious Fraud Office,” Mr Key says.

“This inquiry will be carried out by a retired judge or a QC, who will have full powers under the Inquiries Act to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations, and will report to the Prime Minister.”

Mr Key says he expects the inquiry will take some weeks to complete its work, and is likely to report back after the upcoming election. 

“The matters to be investigated in relation to Ms Collins are serious, and I believe it is important the inquiry have sufficient time to conduct a thorough review of those matters before reporting back,” he says.

“The Inquiries Act envisages the terms of reference will be discussed with the person appointed to the inquiry before they are finalised.  I expect to be able to announce further details on the appointment, the terms of reference and the reporting timeframe in the coming days.”

**Background**

Under the Inquiries Act 2013, a Government Inquiry may be appointed by a Minister or Ministers to inquire into any matter of public importance.  It has the same powers as a Royal Commission of Inquiry or a Public Inquiry, including powers to obtain information from any person, order disclosure of evidence to a person participating in the inquiry, take evidence on oath or affirmation, and summon witnesses.

The inquiry may be conducted by one person (as is intended in this case) or by a panel of several members.

The differences between Royal Commissions, Public Inquiries and Government Inquiries lie in the way they are appointed, and the way in which they report.  A Royal Commission or a Public Inquiry is appointed by the Governor-General (on the advice of Ministers) and reports to the Governor-General.  Its report must be presented to the House of Representatives.  A Government Inquiry is appointed by and reports to one or more Ministers.

The first Government Inquiry appointed under the Inquiries Act was into the Whey Protein Concentrate Contamination Incident, which is still ongoing.  Royal Commissions of Inquiry have recently been carried out in relation to the Canterbury Earthquakes and the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy.

Any inquiry under the Act may be postponed or temporarily suspended if another investigation (such as a Police investigation) is being, or is likely to be, carried out into matters relating to the inquiry, and continuing the inquiry would be likely to prejudice that investigation.
