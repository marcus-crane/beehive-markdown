Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced government funding of $190,000 for the West Coast Regional Council to trial two computer software tools which support good decision-making on water use.

“The West Coast Regional Council will trial the software tools using the Grey River catchment as a case study,” Ms Adams says.

“The applications illustrate the likely consequences of different options for water use and limits on a variety of important aspects of water management.

“For example it could include reliable water supply for farmers, in-stream habitats for trout, the flushing away of nuisance algae, and iwi values.”

The tools to be trialled are the Environmental Flows Strategic Assessment Platform and the Cumulative Hydrological Effects Simulator developed by NIWA.

“Workshops will be held with other councils using the results of the Grey River case study so they can see how the tools can help them to engage their own communities in making good decisions on water use.

“The software can be used at meetings and discussions so communities get a better understanding of the impacts of any decisions they make on using local water.

“This project could also help communities across New Zealand determine water quality and quantity limits for their region, under the National Policy Statement for Freshwater.”

The $190,000 funding is from a targeted round of the Government’s Community Environment Fund.

The round was aimed at activities that support key elements of the Government’s freshwater programme, including implementation of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management and regional planning and community participation in freshwater management.
