State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall says the decision to re-enter Pike River is one to be made by Solid Energy, not Worksafe.

“The Solid Energy board is ultimately accountable and legally responsible for the safety of people working at the Pike River site and any decisions on mine re-entry are their responsibility, and their responsibility alone,” says Mr Ryall.

“Solid Energy has to be sure that any re-entry is safe and that decision is ultimately for them to make, not WorkSafe.

“I understand people’s frustration, but safety has to be absolutely paramount,” says Mr Ryall.
