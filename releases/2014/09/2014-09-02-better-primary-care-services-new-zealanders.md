New Zealanders are getting more immunisations, checks for diabetes and heart diseases and more help to quit smoking says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Primary health organisations (PHOs) are making great strides in preventing long term illness and helping New Zealanders live longer, healthier lives,” says Mr Ryall.

The latest National Primary Care target results shows:

- 84 per cent of eligible people getting heart and diabetes checks – up from 49 per cent in April 2012
- 86 per cent of patients were offered support to quit smoking – compared to 34 per cent in April 2012
- 93 per cent of eight-month old children have been immunised – an increase from 90 per cent in April 2012

“I am particularly pleased to see that children are getting their immunisations. This helps to ensure young children are getting the best start to life and I urge parents and general practices to continue to work together to maintain this exceptional result,” says Mr Ryall.

“These results show how health targets are helping district health boards improve their performance and patients are benefiting from better health services. There is nothing like healthy competition to improve results.

“While there is considerable effort required to achieve some targets, PHOs have made great process under this National-led Government in working towards these,” says Mr Ryall. 

PHOs are funded by district health boards to provide health care services through general practices to patients who are registered with them.
