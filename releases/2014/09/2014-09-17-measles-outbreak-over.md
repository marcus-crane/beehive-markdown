Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the end of the recent measles outbreak in New Zealand.

“Since December last year there have been 281 confirmed measles cases across the North Island, with 15 per cent of these cases requiring hospital treatment,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“So it is great news that the outbreak now appears to be over, with no new cases reported since 10 August 2014.

“Public Health Units in the affected regions have been working hard to halt the spread of this highly infectious virus.

“This has included quarantining unimmunised people who have been exposed to the measles virus, promoting immunisation and raising awareness of the symptoms and seriousness of measles.

“However, with outbreaks of measles still occurring overseas, we cannot be complacent. The current outbreak began from New Zealanders returning from overseas where they had contracted measles, so we know that it can easily occur again.

“As immunisation continues to be the best form of protection, people should check their immunisation status, and get themselves and their families immunised against measles as soon as possible.”

Anyone who suspects they may have measles should phone their GP or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice. It is important to call first before seeing a doctor because measles is highly infectious, and people with measles can infect others in the waiting room.
