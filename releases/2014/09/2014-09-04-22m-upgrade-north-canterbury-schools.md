The Government is investing more than $22 million in the redevelopment of four schools across North Canterbury, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says.

“The funding will be used to expand and upgrade Oxford Area School, Rangiora Borough School, Ashgrove School and Southbrook School as part of the Government’s ongoing investment to ensure that schools have buildings fit for purpose and that provide safe and inspiring modern learning environments,” Ms Kaye says.

“The Oxford and Rangiora communities have experienced population growth following the Christchurch earthquakes, the first of which struck four years ago today.

“I recently announced a $14.9 million investment in Rangiora High School  to accommodate roll growth. The investment in these four additional schoolswill likewise prepare them for anticipated roll growth and reflects the Government’s continued support of the Canterbury region.”

The Government is investing more than $300 million in a six-year programme involving an estimated 30 schools, to address infrastructure issues and modernise their facilities, Ms Kaye says.

“The North Canterbury upgrades are part of the Government’s plan to raise student achievement by ensuring students can learn and achieve in the best possible environments.

“The schools have worked with the Ministry of Education to develop this plan. The new classrooms will be built to the latest learning environment standards that support modern teaching styles and provide a comfortable environment for students.”

The $22m will be allocated approximately as follows:

- Oxford Area School – $4.9m for six roll growth classrooms and the replacement of two relocatable buildings;
- Rangiora Borough School – $7m for four roll growth classrooms, the replacement of a six-classroom permanent block, and two relocatable classrooms;
- Ashgrove School – $4.7m for three roll growth classrooms and the replacement of five relocatable classrooms; and
- Southbrook School – $5.2m for four roll growth teaching spaces, plus the replacement of two classrooms, the school administration building and the library.

In addition, a new primary school is planned for Rangiora and a site has been purchased, with construction currently planned for 2020.
