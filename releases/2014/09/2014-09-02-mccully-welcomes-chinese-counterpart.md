Foreign Minister Murray McCully will host his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, for a working visit to New Zealand from 4-5 September.

“China is an important partner for New Zealand, and the visit by Foreign Minister Wang Yi is an opportunity to expand our cooperation regionally and internationally,” Mr McCully says.

“Our trade with China continues to grow. New Zealand’s annual merchandise exports to China are now over $11.5 billion – an increase of $3.5 billion in the past twelve months.

“China is also an active development player in the Pacific region. China, New Zealand and the Cook Islands are working together on a major water infrastructure programme in Rarotonga and we want to cooperate more closely with China on Pacific development. 

 “My meeting with Minister Wang Yi will cover a range of topics, including the increasing frequency of high-level visits between our two countries, New Zealand’s expanding diplomatic presence in China, our regular human rights dialogue, and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.

“We will also discuss regional and international issues and New Zealand’s United Nations Security Council candidacy,” Mr McCully says.
