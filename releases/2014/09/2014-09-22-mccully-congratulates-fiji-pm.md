Foreign Minister Murray McCully today congratulated Rear Admiral (Ret’d) Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, on being sworn in as Fiji’s Prime Minister.

“The final count of the election results confirmed that Mr Bainimarama’s FijiFirst Party secured a clear majority and he has now been sworn in as Prime Minister,” Mr McCully says.

“Last week Fiji held their first democratic election in eight years and Multinational Observer Group has stated it is satisfied the election was credible, and broadly representative of the will of the Fijian people.

“The election process had been a significant step for Fiji, and for New Zealand’s relationship with Fiji. 

“We have taken a strong interest Fiji’s return to democracy and provided practical support for it from the outset.

“Fiji and New Zealand have a history of close ties and I look forward to continuing our programme of re-engagement with Prime Minister Bainimarama’s Government,” Mr McCully says.
