Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Brussels this weekend to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Foreign Ministers meeting.

“This year’s NATO Foreign Ministers meeting will bring together Ministers from NATO’s 28 member states and countries that contributed to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan,” Mr McCully says.

“The discussions will focus on how the international community can support Afghanistan as the country takes full control of its own security and development.

“The meeting will also cover a range of other international security issues, including efforts to counter extremism and in particular the spread of ISIL.

“In addition to taking part in the NATO meeting, I will hold talks with a number of fellow Foreign Ministers while in Brussels,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully will travel to Brussels via the United Arab Emirates for discussions on regional issues and meetings aimed at promoting our commercial engagement with the UAE.
