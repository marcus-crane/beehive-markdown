Social Development Minister Anne Tolley celebrated the success of KickStart breakfasts at Holy Family School today.

Since the Government began partnering with Fonterra and Sanitarium to deliver the KickStart Breakfast programme, an additional 3 million breakfasts have been served bringing the total number to more than 8 million meals since 2009. The programme reaches more than 26,000 children throughout the country.

The Government’s $9.5 million funding over five years has seen the programme expanded from two to five mornings per week and to include all primary and secondary schools, regardless of decile, that want and need it.

“With the expansion, there’s been a 37 percent increase in the number of schools taking up the programme from 573 to 783 schools with 79 percent now providing breakfasts for more than two days.  54 percent are operating KickStart breakfast five days a week, says Mrs Tolley.

“I’m particularly pleased at how well received the programme is with 98.5 percent of schools satisfied or very satisfied with KickStart Breakfast.

“Schools report it is having a major impact on the well-being of the children.  73 percent noticed improvements in general health and wellbeing, 72 percent reported better concentration, 59 percent saw behaviour improve and 37 percent believe it has improved academic performance.

“KickStart Breakfast is a brilliant example of partnership between government, the private sector, schools and communities in delivering real practical help directly to children so they can focus on their education and have brighter futures,” says Mrs Tolley.
