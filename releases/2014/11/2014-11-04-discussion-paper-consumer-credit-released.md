Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today released a discussion document on new consumer credit regulations aimed at improving the information lenders provide to people taking out loans.

“These regulations will mean consumers can get the information they need to make good decisions when borrowing money,” Mr Goldsmith says. 

“I welcome feedback on these proposals from borrowers and lenders to ensure that the regulations provide the intended consumer benefits while minimising compliance costs.”

The proposed regulations cover the following areas:

- What information lenders should disclose in relation to costs of borrowing;
- What a credit card minimum repayment warning should look like;
- How model disclosure statements should be updated to include new key information which must be provided to consumers before entering an agreement;
- How proportionate rebates should be calculated for extended warranties and repayment waivers when consumers repay early.

Mr Goldsmith says the regulations are part of a programme of work to implement reforms to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Amendment Act that were passed in June this year. 

“The reforms aim to promote fair, efficient and transparent credit markets and promote competition, consumer choice and protection.

“This is another important step in delivering on the Government’s Business Growth Agenda, says Mr Goldsmith.

Feedback on the discussion document is due by 1 December 2014.
