Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed news that Pacific women are benefiting from the strengthening economy.

The latest Household Labour Force Survey shows the unemployment rate for Pacific women fell 6.2 percentage points in the last year, down from 20.5 per cent to 14.3 per cent.

This means 3,700 fewer Pacific women are now unemployed than at the same time last year (down to 8,300 from 12,000).

“Pacific women play a significant role in our communities. They are the backbone of our families and contribute to their health and wellbeing. Being able to get a paying job will go a long way towards supporting their families,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

The unemployment rate for Pacific peoples generally was 4.0 percentage points lower than one year ago, down from 15.7 per cent to 11.7 per cent. This means the number of Pacific people with jobs is 113,700, compared with 103,600 a year ago.

“This is great news for more than 10,000 more Pacific people who now have jobs and are earning a living to contribute to their families and wider communities.

“The economy is growing and moving in the right direction. These latest statistics show how hard working Pacific New Zealanders can make progress and realise the value that comes with paid employment.

“I am proud that Pacific people are attaining success and achievement under this government. As more Pacific people become better qualified they can move into sustainable, higher paying jobs. This is positive for our families, communities and the country.”
