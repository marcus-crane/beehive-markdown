Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said today the Department of Internal Affairs has recalled the passport of prisoner Phillip John Smith, issued in the name of Phillip John Traynor, under S.10 of the Passport Act 1992.

“This means that for all practical purposes, his recently renewed passport is no longer a valid travel document and this recall allows the New Zealand authorities to formally advise international policing agencies that Phillip Traynor has a warrant for arrest in New Zealand and is the passport he is using is invalid”, said Mr Dunne.

Mr Dunne also said that the Department of Internal Affairs had confirmed that there is no record of Mr Traynor changing his name officially to Phillip John Smith.

Details of Mr Traynor’s passport application are now subject to a cross agency investigation and consequently further details regarding his passport application cannot be released.
