Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the Health Promotion Agency’s latest alcohol moderation campaign which launches tonight with a television campaign promoting water as a tool to pace your drinking.

“Binge drinking is a major issue for New Zealand with the social and economic effects impacting on individuals, communities and New Zealand as a whole,” says Dr Coleman.

“Alcohol moderation campaigns like Not Beersies aim to provide people with alternatives that help moderate their alcohol intake. Not Beersies is a positive way to moderate alcohol intake by providing people with something they can do when they refuse a drink.”

The campaign builds on the work that has already been done to provide people with a language to ease up through the award winning ‘Say Yeah, Nah’ campaign.

The Not Beersies campaign, which involved advertising agency FCB is all about water and the advertisements are meant as a parody of classic beer advertisements. Water is renamed Not Beersies and described as brewed by clouds, zero carbs, zero craft, zero beer, and available at a tap near you.

Marketing will take place in the lead up to Christmas and during summer. Aside from television, Not Beersies advertising will be seen in outdoor media (billboards, street posters and adshels) and online.
