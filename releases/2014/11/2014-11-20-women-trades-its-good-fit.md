Minister for Women Louise Upston is encouraging employers to attract more women to trades work to assist with the Canterbury rebuild.

The Minister has today launched a new handbook for employers, giving practical advice on how to attract women to trade jobs, as well as finding qualified female workers for trade positions.

“Demand for skilled workers in Canterbury is high and is forecast to continue,” says Ms Upston. “Some businesses are having difficulty attracting skilled workers to their jobs. My message to employers is to consider all workers when they recruit for their industries.

“There are thousands of women working in trades roles across New Zealand and research has shown there are benefits they can bring to businesses. These include stronger connections with customers, improved performance of businesses and greater diversity of leadership.

“Not only does it make good business sense to attract women to trade industries, better using women’s labour will help build a prosperous and productive New Zealand,” Ms Upston says.

Today’s event in Christchurch also launched the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team’s new personal protection gear for women – with the theme, *It’s a great fit.*

“As well as helping to keep women safe on the job with appropriately fitting clothing, this new range of gear is about increasing the visibility and participation of women in the construction workforce,” Ms Upston says.
