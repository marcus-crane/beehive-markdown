Today the Marlborough Children’s Team begins working with local families for the first time, says Social Development Minister Anne Tolley.

“I visited the new Children’s Team in Blenheim last Friday and I was able to see for myself how they’ve brought together a coordinated group of frontline professionals to plan and wrap services around at-risk children early, to keep them safe from harm so they can thrive, achieve, and belong.

“I’m delighted the communities of Marlborough have succeeded in getting their Children’s Team up and running so quickly, implementing a new approach to child protection in their area,” Mrs Tolley says.

“This is not about adding more services; Children’s Teams are about professionals, practitioners and families working together in a different way and putting the child first. 

“By offering each child who needs it wraparound care and fast-tracked access to services where possible, vulnerable children are being better protected, and kept safe from harm.” says Mrs Tolley.

“Three Children’s Teams have already been established in Rotorua, Whangarei and Horowhenua/Ōtaki and are already supporting more than 200 of our most vulnerable children.

“Children’s Teams are a key component of the Government’s Children’s Action Plan, which has more than 32 specific measures to address child abuse and ensure that New Zealand is a safe place for children to grow up and thrive.

“A huge amount of effort has gone into establishing the new Marlborough Children’s Team. I want to thank and congratulate everyone involved,” Mrs Tolley says.
