Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced that 14 recipients have been awarded Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships for 2015. 

“This year’s Fellows represent a diverse range of sectors, ages, and backgrounds- they are examples of typical New Zealanders studying extraordinary things,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“The chosen fields of study for the 2015 Fellows include poverty, youth suicide prevention, hospice and palliative care, and provincial economic development,” Mrs Goodhew said.

Rachael Selby, Chair of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Board, said the Board is excited to be funding research projects on diverse topics ranging from society’s most pressing problems through to those which enhance the lives of New Zealanders.

“Topics include pressures placed on mountaineering organisations, how no-cost classical music education can help impoverished communities, and how Canada responds to poverty and family violence faced by indigenous children,” Ms Selby said.

“In 2015 The Trust will have been facilitating the study of inspiring topics for fifty years, assisting Fellows to become leaders in their chosen field of study”, Mrs Goodhew said.

“I congratulate all the recipients of this year’s Fellowships and wish them successful and productive research journeys,” Mrs Goodhew said.

The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust aims to help New Zealanders from all walks of life to travel overseas and bring back new insights and understanding that will enrich their community and, ultimately, New Zealand as a whole.
