Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today announced the start of the Block Offer 2015 process for awarding oil and gas exploration permits.

“Consultation now begins with iwi and local authorities in the areas being proposed for onshore and offshore exploration,” says Mr Bridges.

“This is an important first step in the Block Offer process and I encourage iwi and local authorities to take part.  Their feedback ensures that any areas of sensitivity are carefully considered before the 2015 tender round is finalised.”

Four proposed offshore areas and three proposed onshore areas, covering a total area of around 476,000 square kilometres, will be consulted on for Block Offer 2015.

“The annual block offer process presents a range of opportunities for investors and operators, who bring with them vast experience in global exploration and production of oil and gas,” says Mr Bridges. 

“But this is not about development at any cost.  The Government continues its commitment to promoting and managing exploration in a safe and responsible way.

Schedule 4 areas (including national parks and marine reserves) and World Heritage sites are excluded from the Block Offer process.

The consultation period for Block Offer 2015 runs from today to 9 February 2015.
