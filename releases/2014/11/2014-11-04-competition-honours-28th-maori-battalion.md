Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the winners of *The Challenge,* a creative school competition honouring one of New Zealand’s finest fighting forces, the 28th Māori Battalion.

*The Challenge* gives Year 7-13 students the opportunity to express what they learn about the Battalion using 21st century media.

“It was wonderful to see the innovative ways students honoured the living legacy, sacrifice and heroism of the Battalion,” says Ms Parata, who is also Chair of the Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Fund Board.

“The entries were extremely creative, using videos, artwork, waiata, photographic and written essays, power-point presentations and poems.”

Prizes were awarded to 11 entries across junior, intermediate and senior levels.

“The outstanding quality also meant we awarded two Supreme Awards instead of just selecting one of the entries,” says Ms Parata.

The Supreme Award winners are:

- Hariata Dalton-Reedy, from Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Waiū o Ngāti Porou for her essay *Where my Grandfather lies.*
- Rongomai Callaghan and Atareta Smith-Taumata, from Gisborne Girls’ High School for their music video *Māori Battalion Tū ake e*.

“I congratulate Hariata, Rongomai and Atareta for their entries. They and the other winners have truly honoured the young men of the Battalion, and ensured they are remembered by future generations and continue to inspire the leaders of tomorrow.”

**Editor's notes:**
