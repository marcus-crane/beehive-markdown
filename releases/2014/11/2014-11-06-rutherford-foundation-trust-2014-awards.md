“These prestigious awards have this year been granted to seven researchers of the highest quality – four postdoctoral fellowships and three PhD scholarship students,” says Mr Joyce.

“The awards will allow these researchers the opportunity to further develop their capability in science and technology, while ensuring the future of quality science in New Zealand.”

Postdoctoral Fellowships are offered for two years’ research in New Zealand.   The  2014 recipients are:

The PhD Scholarships offer full scholarships for top students to attend the University of Cambridge. Successful applicants are expected to have an excellent undergraduate academic record and the potential to excel in a research environment. The 2014 recipients are:

- Mark Burrell, for research entitled: “Neuroeconomics: Behavioural Neurophysiology of Reward, Risk and Decision-Making”;
