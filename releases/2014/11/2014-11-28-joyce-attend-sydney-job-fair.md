Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce will travel to Sydney on Sunday morning to attend the New Zealand job fair.

The Sydney job fair is the second event in the job fair series, which is taking place across Australia. More than 35 Kiwi employers are heading to Sydney to recruit skilled job seekers to help fill emerging skill gaps in the IT, engineering, healthcare, construction and trades sectors. Around 30 employers and 1750 jobseekers attended the first fair in Perth last weekend.

“The trans-Tasman labour market has seen many Kiwis move to Australia over the last twenty years to take advantage of a range of job opportunities. The time is right for them to consider returning. With unemployment dropping and strong economic growth, New Zealand needs skilled workers to ensure our businesses can continue to expand,” Mr Joyce says.

“Australia is a good market for recruitment and it is exciting to see expats and skilled Australians considering a move across the ditch.”

Mr Joyce will also be meeting with key science and innovation representatives from Australian Technology Park (ATP) Innovations.

Mr Joyce will return to New Zealand on Sunday evening.
