Prime Minister John Key will travel to China and Myanmar next week to attend the APEC Leaders’ meeting and the East Asia Summit.

Mr Key is one of 21 political leaders attending this year’s APEC meeting, which is being hosted by China, in Beijing from November 10-11.

“This year’s APEC is focusing of advancing regional economic cooperation and promoting innovative development, economic reform and growth, which fit well with New Zealand’s own economic priorities,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key will also hold bilateral meetings with other political leaders and speak at the APEC CEO Summit on ‘Securing the Future of Global Finance’.

“I am also looking forward to engaging with the New Zealand CEOs attending the parallel CEO summit.”

Mr Key will visit the Chinese city of Chengdu to open the New Zealand Consulate before flying to Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of Myanmar, to attend the East Asia Summit meeting from November 13-14.

“The EAS gives New Zealand a voice at the table, alongside major countries in the Asia-Pacific region, to discuss key issues that affect our security and prosperity.

“Our largest trading partners will be at these summits so it’s a great opportunity to promote New Zealand as a good place to do business and invest in.  Around 44 per cent of global trade now takes place among APEC economies and 74 per cent of New Zealand’s total goods exports by value is with APEC economies.”

Mr Key departs on November 9 and returns on November 14.

Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Trade Minister Tim Groser will also travel to Beijing to attend Ministerial meetings as part of the APEC Leaders’ week.
