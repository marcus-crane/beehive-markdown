Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says the ASB Community Trust contribution to funding the insulation of houses in Auckland, as part of the *Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes* programme, is an important example of partnership between Government and community organisations.

“Nearly 2000 low-income homes in Auckland will be insulated, with the Trust contributing $1 million in funding.  The proportion of Government funding will decrease from 60 per cent – the typical contribution as part of *Healthy* Homes – down to 33 per cent. 

“I am delighted to see organisations, such as the ASB Community Trust, investing to improve the health of their communities by insulating houses.”

This latest funding by the Trust is part of a long standing partnership with Government to insulate homes.

“Since 2008, the trust has contributed $17 million to support the insulation of over 15,000 homes in Northland and Auckland.

“This is estimated to have delivered over $80 million in benefits to the region, mainly in health by reducing people’s risk of respiratory and other health conditions.”

The *Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes* programme targets low-income households with high health needs for home insulation.  Budget 2013 allocated $100 million over three years to the programme which will see at least 46,000 warmer, drier and healthier homes.

“To date the Government has insulated more than 268,000 houses since 2009 through our Warm Up New Zealand insulation programmes.”
