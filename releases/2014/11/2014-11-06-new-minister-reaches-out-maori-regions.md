The Minister for Māori Development Hon Te Ururoa Flavell is looking forward to a series of regional visits scheduled over the next few months.

“I gave an undertaking when I became a Minister to get out to communities and listen to those people who work with our people every day.  It’s really important that Ministers understand how Government policies impact on our people and I know there are some stark differences across the regions.

“I’m keen to hear at first-hand what the major issues are for local communities and what I can do to support them,” says Mr Flavell.

The first Hui Whakahononga-ā-Rohe (Regional Open Forum) will be held in Gisborne at Te Poho o Rāwiri Marae on Sunday night (9 November 14). The Hui Whakahononga are open to everyone who has an interest in Māori development including individuals, whānau, hapū and iwi. You can find more details about the hui on the Te Puni Kōkiri website at [www.tpk.govt.nz/en/rauika/](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/rauika/)

Mr Flavell encourages people to bring their ideas to the regional hui and be ready to participate.

“I’ll be doing more listening than talking. This is an opportunity for whānau to share their views with me and for us to consider pragmatic ways that I along with other ministerial colleagues can help them achieve their aspirations.”

Hui Whakahononga-ā-Rohe have been organised in Gisborne, Hastings, Whanganui, Taumarunui, Hamilton, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Tauranga, Whakatāne, Palmerston North, Wellington and Auckland. Hui will take place in the South Island early next year.
