Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee confirmed today that the New Zealand Government has ruled out sending troops in a combat role to Iraq.

“However, we acknowledge that some form of capacity-building is clearly required if Iraq is to have a future as a law-abiding democratic country and this will need to include a modern Iraqi military to maintain peace and security,” Mr Brownlee says.

Up to 10 New Zealand military planners are being deployed to the Middle East to determine whether New Zealand can play a role in helping Iraqi Defence Forces build capacity to fight ISIL.

“We’re talking to Australia about what they’re doing to help train the Iraqi security forces and how we might help,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The team will spend time gathering information at allied bases in the region and will report back to Ministers in due course.

“New Zealand has a proven track record of helping build the capability and capacity of armed forces around the world, including in Afghanistan where we have eight personnel at the Afghanistan National Army Academy until April 2015.

“Whether New Zealand plays a similar small role in Iraq, or we determine there are other more appropriate means of supporting the fight against ISIL, will depend on an invitation from the Iraqi Government and New Zealand Government assessment and approval of a building partner capacity mission.

The planning team has skills in military operations, communications, logistics, training and military law.  None of the team is a member of the Special Forces.
