Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government is considering options for moving to the implementation stage of the DHB shared services programme.

“Health Benefits Limited (HBL) has made good progress in developing savings plans for DHBs,” says Dr Coleman.

“These programmes will result in substantial savings being freed up from the back office and re-invested into frontline health services such as more operations, and better cancer treatment.”

The business cases on finance and procurement, laundry, national IT infrastructure, and food services have been developed.

“These cases now have to be implemented, and it is important to get this process right,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government needs certainty on the investment costs and savings projections, and the path ahead. 

“DHBs need to be highly engaged around investment decisions and the Government is seeking their views on the best way to implement the business cases.”

HBL and DHBs have achieved over $300 million in savings since HBL was established in July 2010. DHBs are for example saving around $4 million a year after signing up to a collective banking arrangement.
