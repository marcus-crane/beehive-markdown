The President of the People’s Republic of China, HE Xi Jinping, is to make an extended visit to New Zealand following the G20 meeting of world leaders in Australia next week.

Prime Minister John Key announced today that President Xi, along with a large delegation, will make a state visit to New Zealand from 19 November to 21 November.

“New Zealand is looking forward to hosting the President. It will be an opportunity to highlight the depth of our strengthening relationship and in particular the rapid growth of our trading relationship in recent years,” says Mr Key.

It is the first visit by a Chinese head of state to New Zealand since President Hu Jintao’s visit in 2003.

The President will also be accompanied by his wife, Madame Peng Liyuan.

He will visit both Auckland and Wellington for a series of official engagements, including events which will showcase the bilateral trade, economic and cultural links between our two countries.
