Foreign Minister Murray McCully has today named diplomat Justin Fepuleai as New Zealand’s next Consul-General to New Caledonia. He will also be accredited to French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna.

“Our relationship with the French territories in the Pacific is extremely important,” Minister McCully says.

“New Caledonia and French Polynesia are two of New Zealand’s largest trading partners in the Pacific, and our total goods trade is worth more than $350 million annually.

“We enjoy a good relationship with New Caledonia through regular exchanges at both official and Ministerial-levels across a wide range of sectors.

“New Zealand also works closely with the French Armed Forces in New Caledonia on maritime surveillance, disaster responses and search and rescue operations,” Mr McCully says.

Dr Fepuleai served as Deputy Special Coordinator to RAMSI in Solomon Islands from 2009-2011 and was New Zealand’s Ambassador to Afghanistan from 2011-2012.
