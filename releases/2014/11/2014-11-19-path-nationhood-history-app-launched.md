Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has today launched a free app to help people explore New Zealand’s early history.

The Heritage Trails ‘Path to Nationhood’ app has been developed by Heritage New Zealand and includes six tours of historic Northland. It is free to downloadon smartphones and tablets.

The tours tell the stories of some of the earliest encounters between Māori and Pākehā prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

“This is an excellent tool for New Zealanders and visitors to learn about our history, and to easily engage with the events that shaped our nation,” says Ms Barry.

‘Path to Nationhood’ focuses on stories from the 1770s to the 1830s, including the process of collecting signatures for the Treaty itself, the establishment of Christian missions, as well as many other local tales and characters.

“It brings our history to life, and is an entertaining and informative way for visitors to Northland to find out more about the historic events that helped shape their surroundings.

“With the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty approaching, it’s timely to have an easily accessible way to learn about the events and interactions that led to the signing,” says Ms Barry.
