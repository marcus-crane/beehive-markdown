Christchurch has taken the first steps towards a modern central city transport network that works for all kinds of travel.

Christchurch City Council today gave its approval for designs for the first two Central City transport projects under the umbrella of *An Accessible City* – the transport chapter of the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan.

*An Accessible City* is being delivered by the Council and Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, and has been developed in partnership with the New Zealand Transport Agency, Environment Canterbury (ECan) and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

These projects aim to improve traffic flow and provide safer, more people-friendly and enjoyable ways for people to get around our Central City.

The Council’s Infrastructure, Transport and Environment Committee Chair, Councillor Phil Clearwater, is pleased the Council has approved the projects.

“This marks an exciting time ahead for the Central City. While these new schemes are a change from the way we are used to moving around the Central City and may take some getting used to, the road designs will be better for travellers with improved walking, cycling, public transport and general traffic infrastructure,” Mr Clearwater says.

Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Nicky Wagner says the go-ahead for the first projects under the umbrella of *An Accessible City* is an exciting step for the Central City recovery.

“These first projects at Hospital Corner and the Hagley / Moorhouse Avenue corner represent the beginning of a new Central City network that works better for all kinds of travel,” Ms Wagner says.

“Vehicle traffic will flow better, key facilities like the new Bus Interchange will be easy to access, and the Central City will be cyclist- and pedestrian-friendly with a slower speed limit in the core of the Central City. Cyclists and pedestrians will be able to cross easily from the streets to access ways in the new Frame and Avon River Precinct to get wherever they want to go.

“By making central Christchurch easier and more enjoyable to get around, we are making the central city a more attractive place to live, work, and visit. Bringing people in and encouraging activity are what make a city thrive,” Ms Wagner says.

From *An Accessible City* a number of First Phase transport projects have been identified. The Crown and Christchurch City Council have committed $72 million for transport projects for the new transport chapter.

The NZ Transport Agency welcomes the green light being given for the start of the first two projects that will help redefine the transport network in the heart of the Central City.

“The Agency is investing $18 million in the first phase of *An Accessible City*, working with the Council and CERA, to ensure the transport network is ready for the opening of the new Bus Interchange in the winter of 2015 and that the Central City is redeveloped as a safe, vibrant place for pedestrians and cyclists,” says the Transport Agency's Southern Regional Director Jim Harland.

ECan’s Public Transport Manager David Stenhouse says the changes at Hospital corner would provide great access to the hospital and was an important thoroughfare to the new Bus Interchange.

He says these works will help make passenger transport more effective and efficient as well as be an important step in creating a modern, liveable and people-friendly city.

Roading changes will be made at the Hagley / Moorhouse Corner and surrounding streets and at Hospital Corner, including the entry to Oxford Terrace and parts of Tuam Street, St Asaph Street and Hagley Avenue.

These transport projects focus on improving traffic flow to anchor projects and focus on physical changes to the roading network associated with the new Bus Interchange and Te Papa Ōtākaro / Avon River Precinct.

Work notices will be up from Monday 17 November and there will be no entry to Hagley Avenue from Moorhouse Avenue or Lincoln Road from Friday 21 November. Other road works will happen progressively from now until the end of April 2015.

Key changes include:

- A “T” intersection will be formed at the junction of Lincoln Road and Moorhouse Avenue to increase the efficiency of this intersection.
- No entry to Hagley Avenue from Moorhouse Avenue.
- Hagley Avenue becomes one-way south-bound between Selwyn Street and Moorhouse Avenue, with a left turn only onto Moorhouse Avenue.
- Tuam Street will be the primary east-bound route into the Central City.
