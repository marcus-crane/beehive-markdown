Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated all those who worked to establish the C Company Memorial House which opened in Gisborne today.

The new permanent space for the 28th Maori Battalion C Company exhibition will house photos, taonga and other military memorabilia, and is adjacent to the existing Tairawhiti Museum.

Ms Parata says C Company has a special place in the history of the East Coast region and New Zealand.

“The soldiers of C Company were part of one of New Zealand’s finest fighting forces. Nga Tama Toa Trust and Tairawhiti Museum have done a fantastic job managing the collection of taonga and informing the public of the achievements of the soldiers.

”This house ensures the spirit and sacrifice of the soldiers of C Company is recognised and remembered. Locals and visitors to Gisborne now have a place to go to acknowledge the soldiers’ contribution and reflect on their triumphs and tragedies.

“I also have a personal debt of thanks to my grandfather who was an officer in C Company, together with many other relatives.”

Ms Parata attended the ceremonial opening which took place almost 100 years to the day that 60 Maori volunteers departed Gisborne for WWI. As part of the ceremony, 60 serving soldiers marched in a parade to honour those soldiers.

The Government contributed $500,000 towards the construction of C Company House, on top of funding of $600,000 under the Regional Museums Policy to the Tairawhiti Museum’s redevelopment and extension project.
