Land Information Minister Louise Upston has welcomed the removal of aquatic hornwort from Lake Karapiro, saying it will enhance the health of this nationally significant lake. 

The project will ensure the public can fully enjoy the lake, especially with a number of notable events this summer.

“Lake Karapiro – near my home – is one of our most well-known lakes and is enjoyed by both locals and visitors alike,” says Ms Upston.

The Waikato Regional Council and Waipa District Council jointly funded work at Lake Karapiro and Horahora domains.  The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) gave scientific field support.  Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) provided biosecurity expertise and led the project.

Hornwort (*Ceratophyllum demersum*) is currently New Zealand’s worst submerged freshwater weed.  It is believed to have been introduced for use in aquariums and ornamental ponds in the early 1960s, but the invasive weed is now widely established in waterways throughout the North Island.

The work was done in early November.  LINZ is considering options for a longer-term programme to help reduce hornwort build up over time.

“This is a great example of local and central government working together, with scientific support, and builds on LINZ’s continuing work to control aquatic weed in some nationally significant lakes throughout the country.

“I’m pleased this work has been done. Thousands of athletes will be coming to New Zealand for the World Masters Games in 2017, and Lake Karapiro will be better prepared to be showcased to the world,” says Ms Upston.
