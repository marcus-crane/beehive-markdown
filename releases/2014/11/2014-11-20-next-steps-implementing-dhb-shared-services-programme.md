Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government has agreed to explore a proposal put forward by DHBs to move implementation of the shared services programme to a DHB-owned vehicle.

“While Health Benefits Limited (HBL) has made good progress in developing savings plans for DHBs, the responsibility for implementing these business cases needs to sit with DHBs,” says Dr Coleman.

“Now is the right time to consider the organisational options for DHBs to lead the implementation phase of the business cases on finance and procurement, laundry, national IT infrastructure, and food services.

“It is important to maintain momentum on implementing these business cases to ensure savings are freed up from the back office and re-invested into frontline health services.

“The DHBs preference is for healthAlliance (FPSC) Limited to lead the implementation process.

“I have asked the Acting Director-General of Health to establish an interim project governance group to work through the next steps which will include a due diligence process. A final proposal will then be taken to Cabinet for approval.

“It is expected that HBL will be wound down once the appropriate transitional plans have been agreed. This handover is expected to occur by the end of June 2015.”
