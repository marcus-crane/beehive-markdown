Prime Minister John Key today announced that New Zealand has upgraded its diplomatic mission in Yangon, Myanmar to a full Embassy.

“Our relationship with Myanmar has been developing quickly in response to the political and economic reforms initiated there in 2011,” Mr Key says.

“New Zealand opened an Embassy office in late 2013, and the decision to upgrade to a full Embassy reflects the strong and growing relationship.

“The current Chargé d’Affaires Bruce Shepherd will now become our first resident Ambassador to Myanmar.

“We have significantly increased our development relationship with Myanmar in the last two years. Our aid and development programme is currently worth around $4 million annually and is focused on agriculture and disaster risk management.

“We welcome Myanmar’s reintegration into the international community following the start of its reform process.  Myanmar’s successful chairing of the ASEAN and EAS regional meetings this year are an important milestone,” Mr Key says.

Prime Minister Key is currently in Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of Myanmar, to attend the East Asia Summit meeting.
