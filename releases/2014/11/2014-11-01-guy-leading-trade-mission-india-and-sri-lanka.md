Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is leading a six-day New Zealand trade mission to Sri Lanka and India, departing tomorrow.

The Minister will be accompanied by representatives of 15 New Zealand organisations as well as ex-New Zealand cricket captain Stephen Fleming, who is coach of the Chennai Super Kings cricket team.

“This trade mission to Colombo, Delhi and Mumbai is a great opportunity to profile New Zealand’s co-hosting of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup in just 100 days to two cricketing nations,” says Mr Guy.

"It is also a chance to promote New Zealand's world-class agricultural products, hi tech services and hospitality.

“New Zealand’s exports to Sri Lanka are valued at around $288 million each year and $594 million for India, but there is scope to grow our trade with both markets.

“In India I will also be promoting New Zealand as a world-class destination for holiday-makers and students. India is one of our fastest growing sources of tourists and linking New Zealand’s natural appeal with the Cricket World Cup will be a very appealing package.

“On the cricket pitch we are fierce competitors, but our trade and business links with Sri Lanka and India are stronger than ever,” says Mr Guy.

Mr Guy and the New Zealand trade delegation will be meeting with Indian and Sri Lankan Ministers and business people throughout the trade mission.

The 14 members of the New Zealand trade delegation are Fonterra, Alliance Group, Zespri, Pipfruit NZ, Sports & Leisure (Tiger Turf), ATEED, CERA, Christchurch International Airport, Fisher & Paykel Appliances, India NZ Business Council, International Aviation Academy NZ, Menumate, Quality NZ, and Serko.
