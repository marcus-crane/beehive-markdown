Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced a Major Events Development Fund (MEDF) investment of $550,000 for an international Golden Oldies event to be held in Christchurch in 2018. 

The Golden Oldies World Sports Festival is a month-long event that will attract masters age teams and individuals from across the world to participate in seven sports: cricket, football, golf, hockey, netball, rugby and softball. 

“This festival will provide an excellent opportunity for the promotion of Christchurch as a sport tourism destination, and will be a welcome contribution to the economic and social recovery of the region,” Mr Joyce says. “This is consistent with the Government’s strategy of attracting major events that will deliver economic results and showcase New Zealand internationally.

“Planning for such a major event begins well in advance to accommodate the expected influx of participants, supporters and spectators. Up to 6800 international visitors are forecast to visit New Zealand for this event in April 2018.”

The Government’s investment will go towards international marketing of the event to drive visitation, increase length of stay, and showcase Christchurch as being open for business to an international audience.

“There will also be many opportunities for Cantabrians and New Zealanders to participate in the celebration, which is expected to leave a lasting legacy for grassroots and masters sport in the Canterbury region,” Mr Joyce says.

The Government invests, through the MEDF, in major events that generate significant immediate and long-term benefits to New Zealand, and that align with wider Government objectives through leverage and legacy opportunities.
