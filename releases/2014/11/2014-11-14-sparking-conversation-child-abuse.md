Social Development Minister Anne Tolley this morning adopted her Buddy Day “Buddy” called Poppy at the launch in Wellington.

“Buddy Day is about advocating for the rights of children, promoting child protection, and challenging people to make the safety of children their business, not someone else’s responsibility,”

 “Every adult has the power to make a difference in the lives of children in New Zealand – by making sure their everyday environments are safe, or by speaking up if something isn’t right.” says Mrs Tolley

2014 is the fourth year Child Matters have run Buddy Day. 1500 child-size Buddies are created by children around New Zealand then adopted by adults who look after the Buddies for the day, taking them into their communities and workplaces to generate conversations about child abuse and the responsibility every adult has to help protect children.

“Every child has the right to grow up in a country where they are safe and free from abuse. We have a responsibility to protect children from those who pose a serious risk to their safety,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We introduced the Children’s Action Plan which has more than 30 specific measures designed to prevent abuse and neglect. It will make a real difference in reducing child abuse in this country.

“This Government is focused on protecting children and we’re committed to doing the hard work to make a difference,” says Mrs Tolley.

*Editor's note:* the Buddy’s name is Poppy, she is a rockstar, and was created by Regina and Lucy at Arts on Show.
