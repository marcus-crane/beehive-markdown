Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart today for China to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade. Mr Groser will join trade ministers from 20 other APEC economies in Beijing from November 7-8.

This year’s meeting, themed ‘Shaping the Future through Asia-Pacific Partnership’, is an opportunity for trade ministers to discuss the current state of play of the World Trade Organisation, regional economic integration and a range of other trade related topics.

“APEC is a vehicle for moving the region towards greater economic integration,” says Mr Groser.

“This year’s movements towards the vision of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific are particularly promising.”

In the margins of the APEC meeting, Mr Groser will meet with some of his trade counterparts, and attend several business-related events.

The APEC Ministers’ meeting comes ahead of the APEC Leaders’ Meeting on 10 – 11 November, which the Prime Minister will attend.

APEC brings all the major economies in the Asia Pacific Region: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Viet Nam.
