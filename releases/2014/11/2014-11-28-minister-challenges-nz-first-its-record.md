Minister of Corrections Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today challenged NZ First on accountability and said the primary focus for him as Minister of Corrections is the security and safety of the public.

“Under the previous Labour-NZ First Government, there were 15 breaches from temporary release between 2005 and 2008.  That compares to just four under National since 2008,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I didn’t see NZ First MP Ron Mark complaining at the time, when New Zealand had on average five people a year absconding under his Government’s watch.

“The absconding of Phillip Smith raised serious questions about some of the processes, policies and handling of cases of prisoners on temporary release by Corrections. 

“That is why I asked the Chief Executive for an urgent review and that is why temporary releases were suspended until 9 December 2014, except under exceptional circumstances,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The urgent review has provided 13 recommendations to address the specific issue of temporary releases and I have asked Corrections to focus their efforts on implementing these as quickly as possible.”

These recommendations include, among others, making GPS monitoring mandatory for all temporary releases unless there is a good reason not to and limiting temporary releases to 12 hours.

“Temporary releases have been a part of Corrections for nearly 60 years. However, what the urgent review has clearly shown is that there was no single fault in this case, but there were multiple failings across the board.

“My job is to fix these issues and that is exactly what I am doing.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says. 

The Government Inquiry announced by State Services Minister Paula Bennett will cover the issues of identities, passports, information sharing and the wider issue of Mr Smith’s absconding. 

“I don’t want to pre-judge the outcome of that Government Inquiry and neither should NZ First.”
