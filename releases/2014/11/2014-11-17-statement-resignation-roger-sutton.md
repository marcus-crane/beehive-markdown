Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says he’s disappointed by the events which have led to the resignation today of Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) chief executive Roger Sutton.

“The State Services Commission sets high standards,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I want to acknowledge Roger’s contribution as chief executive of CERA over the past three-and-a-half years.

“Since CERA’s inception Roger has been ably supported by a very talented and experienced senior team, all of whom are leaders in their own right.

“For CERA, work continues as usual, and interaction with the public and other organisations is unaffected.  

“I have every confidence the organisation will be well led in the future.”
