Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman today saw physical activity and nutrition programme Project Energize in action at Manaia View School in Northland.

“New Zealand has a growing obesity problem and projects like Project Energize can make a big difference,” says Dr Coleman

“We know that sport and good nutrition helps to keep kids healthy, and it helps them do better in the classroom. Project Energize wraps up all these factors in one package and it is delivering great results.

“It is good to see the sport, health and education sectors working together for the benefit of Kiwi kids. We want to see more collaboration like this.”

Project Energize, which was started in 2005 by Sport Waikato and Waikato DHB, aims to improve children’s physical activity and nutrition.

It is delivered by Energizer teams who work with local schools to provide hands-on support with initiatives that increase the quantity and quality of physical activity or improve healthy eating. 

An evaluation of Project Energize in 2011 showed that it had delivered measurable improvements in the health of Waikato children.

Counties Manukau Sport and Sport Northland have also taken up the programme. It has been trialled in Northland since the start of 2013.
