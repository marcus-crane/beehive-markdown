Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has marked one hundred days to go until the first match of the Cricket World Cup in Auckland today.

“It was great to team up with cricketing legend Sir Richard Hadlee and Mayor Len Brown to mark the milestone, and launch a nationwide tour of the ICC Cricket World Cup trophy,” says Dr Coleman.

“The trophy is on display in Auckland’s Wynyard Quarter today and will be making 22 stops in total between Kaitaia and Bluff over the next 22 days.”

The tournament’s opening match between New Zealand and Sri Lanka will be held at the recently redeveloped Hagley Oval in Christchurch on 14 February 2015 – kicking off 49 matches over 44 days, across 14 venues in New Zealand and Australia.

“Tournament organisers have done a great job at keeping this affordable for Kiwi fans and families, with ticket prices starting at $5 for children and $20 for adults,” says Dr Coleman.

“Not only is the tournament fantastic for local cricket fans, it will also be a great opportunity to showcase New Zealand to the world with the television audience expected to exceed 1.6 billion people.”

As the tournament’s co-hosts, Australia will also be marking the countdown later today in Sydney.
