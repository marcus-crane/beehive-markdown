Conservation Minister Maggie Barry has presented Clive Paton of Martinborough with the 2014 Loder Cup at a ceremony today, for his significant contribution to habitat restoration in New Zealand.

“Clive Paton is a remarkable individual and very deserving of being this year’s Loder Cup recipient. He is an inspirational example of somebody with drive, energy and a vision, who has woven conservation into his life,” says Ms Barry.

The Loder Cup is awarded and presented by the Minister of Conservation annually for outstanding achievements in flora conservation work.

Clive Paton ONZM is a respected conservationist and winemaker. Founder and co-owner of the Ata Rangi vineyard in Martinborough, he is a long-time supporter of “Project Crimson”, which restores New Zealand’s rata and pohutukawa trees.

“Clive values and cherishes the natural landscape of South Wairarapa and has created an impressive legacy for that area. It is clear that it is more than just a business for him, it is a vocation,” says Ms Barry. 

Mr Paton is Board Director for the Pukaha Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre, and owner and restorer of ‘the Bush Block’ south of Martinborough. He was instrumental in forming Waihora Watch, to protect the Waihora Stream catchment area.

“With his commitment to conservation, Clive has provided leadership and inspiration to the wider community,” says Ms Barry

He is the founding Chairman of the Aorangi Restoration Trust, a community-led project working to enhance the natural heritage values of the Aorangi Forest Park and surrounding area.

In 2012, Mr Paton was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to conservation and the wine industry.
