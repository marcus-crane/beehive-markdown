Prime Minister John Key held successful talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wellington today.

“This is President Xi’s third official visit to New Zealand, but his first as President, so it’s a very significant occasion.  I’m delighted that the First Lady, Madame Peng, has also joined him on this trip,” says Mr Key.

“Our relationship with China has never been in better shape. China is now New Zealand’s largest trading partner and we have strong links in a number of areas including business, tourism and education.

“Today we have agreed to characterise the relationship between our nations as a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, recognising the significance of the bilateral relationship to both countries.”

Ten new agreements and arrangements between New Zealand and China have been signed, including an amendment to the Free Trade Agreement that will enable a television co-production arrangement.

“These agreements, in a range of areas, are a further reflection of the growing depth of New Zealand and China’s strong relationship,” says Mr Key.

“The Television Co-production Agreement will allow programmes co-produced by New Zealand and Chinese companies to be officially broadcast on Chinese TV, where potential viewing audiences are huge.

“China has become our fastest-growing, and second-largest, source of visitors and to recognise that today we have announced a new initiative to extend the China Working Holiday Scheme, which will enable Chinese Working Holiday makers to work for the same employer for up to six months.”

Other initiatives signed today include:

- an arrangement on the mutual recognition of academic qualifications in higher education
- a Food Supervisory and Traceability Cooperation Programme between the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries and the China Food and Drug Administration
- an arrangement between the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the China National Tourism Administration to work together to improve the tourist experience in both countries
- a new partnership between New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and the China Chamber of Commerce of Foodstuffs and Native Produce.
- an arrangement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Antarctic Cooperation
- an arrangement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Climate Change Cooperation.

“I am delighted to host President Xi and Madame Peng in New Zealand and I hope they enjoy the rest of their time here.”
