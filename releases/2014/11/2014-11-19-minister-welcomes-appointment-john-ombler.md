Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the appointment of John Ombler as Acting Chief Executive of CERA.

“Mr Ombler was instrumental in CERA’s establishment phases and did an outstanding job as interim Chief Executive, a position he held for six weeks following the passage of the CERA legislation,” says Mr Brownlee.

“In particular, he was responsible for setting up the department’s organisational structure, so he is well suited to lead CERA into its next period of organisational change.

“I have every confidence this appointment will ensure the great work of CERA continues. Mr Ombler will be supported by a very able senior leadership team and talented staff, whose hard work and commitment will ensure the rebuild of Christchurch retains its momentum.”
