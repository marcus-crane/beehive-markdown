Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed today’s announcement by German Chancellor Angela Merkel of a Memorandum of Understanding between Auckland University’s Bio-engineering Institute and Germany’s Fraunhofer.

“Science is the jewel in the crown of the bilateral relationship between New Zealand and Germany,” Mr Joyce says. “Research co-operation between NZ and Germany is underpinned by the Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement which was signed back in 1977.

“Chancellor Merkel’s visit today attests to our decades-long relationship in the area of science and innovation. I am encouraged by the joint initiatives that reflect the innovation in both of our countries.”

The Memorandum of Understanding paves the way for a joint research programme on medical robotics. The Government has also confirmed, in principle, co-funding of up to $750,000 over three years to help New Zealand companies leverage commercial opportunities. This will be matched by the University of Auckland and Fraunhofer.

“Science and innovation are at the heart of achieving a brighter future for New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says. “They are fundamental to our growing economy and improving living standards for all New Zealanders.

“To compete in a global landscape, we need to support new ideas and new ways of thinking, and work collaboratively across a range of disciplines to find solutions to the world’s most pressing problems.

“New Zealand values its strong science and innovation relationship with Germany, and I look forward to it remaining a centrepiece of our international engagement.”
