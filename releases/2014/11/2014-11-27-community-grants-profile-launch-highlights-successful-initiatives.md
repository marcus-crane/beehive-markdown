Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew launched the 2013/14 Community Organisations Grants Scheme (COGS) Profile in Christchurch today.

“For 29 years COGS has been an important source of government funding for non-profit community organisations,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“The COGS Profile launch is an opportunity to highlight the outcomes achieved by these exceptional organisations that benefited from the $12.5 million in funding over the past year.

“Among the many examples out there, funding has assisted youth oriented spaces such as ‘The Crib’ in Queenstown, and ensured community targeted support services in Christchurch can meet their staffing and running costs.”

Funding decisions are made by over 250 volunteers that make up the 37 Local Distribution Committees throughout New Zealand.

“These volunteers have the challenging job of making decisions about what social services best meet the needs of their communities,” Mrs Goodhew says. 

“Local Distribution Committee members and the National COGS Committee members deserve recognition for their commitment to making a tangible difference in their communities.”

Mrs Goodhew was joined by the National COGS Committee to launch the profile today at Nga Hau e Wha National Marae in Christchurch. The COGS profile is available through the Department’s regional offices or can be downloaded from the [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
