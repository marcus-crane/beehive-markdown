Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a record 728 students received a Hauora Māori scholarship award this year, the highest number since the scholarship fund began in 2000.

“The Hauora Māori scholarship fund supports and encourages more Māori into a career in the health sector,” says Dr Coleman.

“The number of scholarship applicants has grown significantly in recent years. This year in the medical category alone, 147 Māori students were awarded a scholarship – an increase of 50 percent since 2009.”

Funded through the Ministry of Health’s Māori Provider Development Scheme, the scholarships were established to build Māori health workforce capacity.

Applicants are judged on their academic achievement, work experience and commitment to Māori health. Scholarships worth $1,700 were awarded to students in a range of areas from nursing to physiotherapy, and scholarships of $4,200 were awarded to medical and dental students.

“The record number of Hauora Māori scholarship applicants also reflects the increase in Māori participation across the health sector,” says Dr Coleman.

“More Māori are involved in decision-making and health service delivery, which is vital to delivering appropriate and effective services for Māori.

“It is important the workforce reflects the community it serves. Our Māori health workforce is a key asset, and we need to continue to strengthen it so that future challenges can be addressed.”

Dr Coleman paid tribute to the Hauora Māori scholarship recipients at an awards ceremony at Te Papa, Wellington last night.

He also recognised the John McLeod Scholarships and Te Apa Mâreikura Awards 2014 recipients - medical students Laine Marsh and Anika Tiplady, and postgraduate students Ricky Bell and Rachel Brown, who each received an award of $10,000.
