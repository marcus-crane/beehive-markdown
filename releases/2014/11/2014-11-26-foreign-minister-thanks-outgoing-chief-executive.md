Foreign Minister Murray McCully today thanked outgoing MFAT Chief Executive John Allen for his service.

“Mr Allen was the first non-diplomat to hold the top job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade,” Mr McCully says.

“He was appointed in 2009 and immediately set about helping to create a Ministry that was more modern, effective, and focused on delivering real benefits to New Zealanders.

“Under his leadership the Ministry has realigned our aid programme to ensure we are making a tangible difference in our region, continued to push for free and open trade, and managed our campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

“I wish Mr Allen all the best for his future endeavors. Because of his efforts the Ministry is in a strong position to capitalise on the opportunities presented by our upcoming term on the Security Council and meet any challenges that may arise in the future,” Mr McCully says.

An acting Chief Executive will be announced shortly and a formal recruitment process will commence next week to find Mr Allen’s replacement.
