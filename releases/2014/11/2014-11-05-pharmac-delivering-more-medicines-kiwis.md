Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an additional 42,885 New Zealanders benefited from Pharmac’s decisions on funded medicines in 2013/14.

“Pharmac has a good track record on controlling pharmaceutical costs while increasing subsidised medicines and treatments for more New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“Its latest annual report for 2013/14 shows in the last year Pharmac funded 26 new medicines and widened access to a further 35 medicines. This has benefited thousands of New Zealanders.

“Last month Pharmac approved its largest single deal with Novartis and Biogen Idec which will see 10 new medicines funded, and either reduced prices or widened access to eight others. This includes better access to new multiple sclerosis medicines.

“In addition to funding new medicines, Pharmac achieved savings of $52.2 million which helped to make new investments possible.”

In 2013 Pharmac’s role was expanded to include the management of community medicines, pharmaceutical cancer treatments, the National Immunisation Schedule, management of all medicines used in DHB hospitals, and the national contracting of hospital medical devices.

“In its first year of managing hospital medicines and beginning national contracting for hospital medical devices, Pharmac achieved net annual savings to DHBs of $25.62 million,” says Dr Coleman.
