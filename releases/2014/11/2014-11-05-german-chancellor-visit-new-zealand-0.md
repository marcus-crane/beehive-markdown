Prime Minister John Key has announced German Chancellor Angela Merkel will visit New Zealand next week ahead of the G20 meeting of world leaders in Australia.

The visit on Friday November 14 will be the first to New Zealand by a German Chancellor since Helmut Kohl’s in 1997.

“I am delighted Chancellor Merkel is visiting New Zealand. This is a significant visit by the leader of one of our closest partners in Europe,” says Mr Key.

“Being able to discuss significant global issues such as the conflict in Iraq and Syria with her will be invaluable ahead of New Zealand taking up a seat on the United Nations Security Council next year.”

As well as formal talks the Chancellor will give a lecture at Auckland University and meet New Zealand and German business representatives.

“Germany is the world’s fourth biggest economy and Chancellor Merkel’s visit is also a great opportunity to discuss trade and economic opportunities. Our economic links are already strong and two-way trade now exceeds that with the UK,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key will join Chancellor Merkel and other leaders at the G20, which is being held in Brisbane on November 14/15.
