Social Development Minister Anne Tolley today presented awards honouring ten foster care families at Government House in Wellington.

“These awards recognise the hard work and selfless commitment foster carers make to some of our most vulnerable children in need of a stable home,” Mrs Tolley says.

“On behalf of all New Zealanders, I thank these outstanding foster parents for stepping up and supporting these children, bringing them into their homes, and most importantly, providing a family place where they can be safe, comfortable, and free from abuse.”

Mrs Tolley joined Governor General, Lt Gen Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae in presenting the awards to ten exceptional foster care families who came from all over New Zealand to attend the awards ceremony at Government House.

This is the third year that the awards have been jointly hosted by Fostering Kids New Zealand and Child, Youth and Family.

There are around 3,500 foster carers in New Zealand, with about 4,000 children in care at any one time.

“Supporting our most vulnerable children is a tough, often thankless job. Today we are recognising the incredible work foster carers do and the difference they make in the lives of so many children.” says Mrs Tolley.
