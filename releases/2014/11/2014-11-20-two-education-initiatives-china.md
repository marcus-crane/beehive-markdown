Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced the signing with China of two initiatives that will further enhance educational initiatives between China and New Zealand.

The bilateral education arrangements were part of the eighth meeting of the New Zealand-China Joint Working Group on Education and Training, which coincided with the visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to New Zealand this week.

The Arrangement on Mutual Recognition of Academic Qualifications in Higher Education will see greater recognition of qualifications between New Zealand and China, making it easier for students to further their studies in either country.

“This agreement will increase New Zealand’s attractiveness as a study destination and expand opportunities for Kiwis looking to study in China,” says Mr Joyce.

The Arrangement to Operationalise the Vocational Education and Training Model Programme agrees to more collaborative research projects, joint programmes (including the delivery of New Zealand qualifications in China), knowledge-sharing symposia, and education development opportunities.

“This programme will facilitate exchanges between educational institutions in New Zealand and China to develop initiatives that are beneficial for both countries,” says Mr Joyce.

“We each recognise the significant contribution that education makes to the economic health of our nations, and the longer-term benefits that flow through the increased social and cultural understanding that follow.”

In addition, an Agreement on Co-Operation in Higher Education was renewed by Universities New Zealand and the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE).

That will further enhance connections between universities in China and New Zealand, which may include partnerships, researcher and student exchanges, and staff development.
