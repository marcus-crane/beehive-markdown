Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has outlined his goal for the primary sector to double the value of exports by 2025 today in a speech to industry leaders in Wellington today.

“The export double goal is an ambitious but achievable target, which will require export growth of around 5% a year,” says Mr Guy.

“This target is based on 2012 export figures of $32 billion for the primary sector, with the aim of raising this to $64 billion by 2025.

“There are three key challenges and opportunities ahead of us in achieving this. The first is increasing our competitiveness through things like improved collaboration and trade access.

“Adding value to what we produce is critical, by using science, research and innovation.

“Protecting the value of our products is just as important through industry earning its ‘social licence.’ This means producing our products sustainably, bringing the community with us, and earning their respect and understanding.

“Environmental sustainability is no longer a ‘nice to have’ - it’s a necessity for the New Zealand public and our global consumers.

“Thirdly, we need to attract the best people into the primary industries. Industry and Government need to start working closely together because we are facing a skills shortage in the future.”

The speech was delivered to the Primary Sector Bootcamp, which is made up of chief executives from primary sector organisations including beef, sheep, seafood, viticulture and horticulture.

Mr Guy has challenged members of the programme to report back to him in February with the three biggest obstacles and opportunities their industries in reaching the export double target, and how the Government can help overcome these.

He has also asked Bootcamp members to form a skills working group to work closely with the Ministry of Primary Industries to help deliver practical solutions.
