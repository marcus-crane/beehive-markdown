Air links between New Zealand and the Philippines are set to improve with the signing today of an air services arrangement, says Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

The arrangement signed today by Transport Minister Simon Bridges and the Philippines Ambassador, Virginia Benavidez, amends the 2007 Air Services Agreement between New Zealand and the Philippines.

The new arrangement allows Air New Zealand to begin its plans to code-share to the Philippines with Singapore Airlines from January 2015.

“The Philippines is an important friend and trading partner for New Zealand. Over 40,000 Filipinos have chosen to live and work here. They are making a valuable contribution to our economy, including the rebuilding of Christchurch.

“Currently there is no direct air service between the two countries, however the new code-sharing provision will help develop the market and build momentum towards possible direct flights in the future.

“Our Filipino community will soon find it easier to travel between New Zealand and their homeland for holidays and to connect with their friends and family. New Zealanders wishing to visit the Philippines will also benefit from improved airline connections between the two countries,” Mr Bridges says.

Nearly 14,000 Filipinos visited New Zealand in the year ended September 2014. In the same period, just over 19,000 New Zealanders travelled to the Philippines as their main overseas destination.
