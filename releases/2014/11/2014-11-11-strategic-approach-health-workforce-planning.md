Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new Health Workforce New Zealand reports show New Zealand has a sound strategy in place on workforce planning.

“We have a good system in place for identifying and addressing workforce issues, and it is paying dividends despite the global workforce challenges,” says Dr Coleman.

*The Role of Health Workforce New Zealand* provides valuable data on how the workforce has developed in the last five years. *Health of the Health Workforce 2013-14* is the first annual report on the current state of the workforce.

“These reports show New Zealand’s health workforce is in good shape,” says Dr Coleman.

“The number of practising doctors and nurses has grown steadily over the last five years. There are currently 14,395 doctors registered with the Medical Council of New Zealand, an increase of 1,902 since 2009, and 51,387 nurses are registered with the Nursing Council of New Zealand, an increase of 5,422.

“Health Workforce New Zealand plays a key role helping to ensure the health workforce is well trained, appropriately configured, and able to address the current and future health needs of New Zealanders.

“As we move to a more integrated healthcare system with more services provided in the community, we need a flexible workforce which fully utilises the skills of key professionals such as nurses and pharmacists.

“A capable and well distributed supply of health professionals is crucial to delivering the health services that New Zealanders need, and supports the delivery of the Government’s health targets and key health priorities.”

Health Workforce New Zealand was set up in 2009 to take a proactive role in forecasting need and future-proofing New Zealand’s health workforce.
