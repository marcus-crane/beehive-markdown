Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today acknowledged the release of the Department of Corrections’ Chief Custodial Officer’s Review of the Failure to Return from Temporary Release of Phillip John Smith.

“This review shows there were a number of failings within Corrections regarding the management of the prisoner in the lead-up to his absconding,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“The main issue was that the plan to manage the prisoner was misinformed.”

As well as the failure to manage the prisoner adequately, the review showed there was conflicting information about the risks the prisoner posed, issues with the sponsor selection process and flaws in the policy for managing prisoners on temporary release, says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“In addition, the review shows the response from staff at Spring Hill Corrections Facility was passive.  They did not have a clear process to follow once suspicions were raised as to the prisoner’s whereabouts,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Quite simply, this is not good enough and reflects poorly on Corrections’ handling of this case.  It is the right of all New Zealanders to trust Corrections to manage prisoners for the safety and security of the public.  That trust has been sorely tested and there is a great deal of work to do to restore it.

“Corrections’ internal review made 13 recommendations to improve the temporary release process and they are adopting all 13 of them.

The key recommendations are: 

- Making GPS monitoring the default for all prisoners on temporary release unless authorised by the prison manager
- Limiting temporary releases to a maximum of 12 hours, unless approved by the National Commissioner
- Convening a multi-disciplinary panel chaired by the prison manager to consider all temporary releases (This panel will include Police, CYF, a local community representative, Psychologist and Probation staff)

“In addition to these recommendations I have asked Corrections for further advice as to whether a wider review of the Corrections Act 2004 is needed.  I want to ensure that the Act is fit for purpose and adequately reflects the needs and expectations of the Corrections environment.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga says Corrections’ internal review will also inform the Government Inquiry into the matter, as announced by State Services Minister Paula Bennett yesterday.

A summary of the review and recommendations will be available on the Corrections website.
