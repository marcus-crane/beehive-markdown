On a visit today to Clifton Terrace Model School in Wellington, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced funding of $5.4 million to enable upgrades to improve wireless connectivity for more than 400 schools.

Ms Kaye says it’s a significant boost for staff and students who want to be more mobile with their devices while at school.

“Last year the Government announced that any school receiving school network upgrades (SNUP) in the future would automatically receive wireless upgrades. This has been a great addition to ensuring that more students have access within schools.

“This announcement is about ensuring that we help retrofit schools who received SNUP upgrades prior to 2010 who may need better access to quality wireless connections. These are schools which we believe will be the least wireless capable.”

**“**The Ministry of Education will be contacting schools to offer them access to the upgrade.

“This wireless upgrade will run alongside SNUP with the Government already investing more than $700 million on infrastructure and fast connections for schools.

“Evidence suggests widespread and mobile access to the internet will lead to new and significant opportunities for students, parents and teachers.

“The rollout of wireless connections to these schools is a vital step in delivering these opportunities, ensuring young New Zealanders can learn anytime, anywhere.

“Good wireless access enables teachers and students to have greater access to learning throughout the school.”
