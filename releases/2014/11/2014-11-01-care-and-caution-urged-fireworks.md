Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith is urging people to be responsible and respectful when using fireworks over the Guy Fawkes week ahead, with sales permitted from tomorrow until Wednesday 5 November.

“We want people to enjoy their fireworks but this relies on users carefully following instructions, ensuring children are properly supervised and being conscious of neighbours and animals,” Dr Smith says.

“The tightened firework regulations that took effect in 2008 reducing the period of sale to four days, increasing the age of purchase from 14 to 18, and restricting the power and size of retail packages have been successful in bringing down the number of related injuries and fire incidents.”

The Government monitors compliance and safety of firework regulations through the Environmental Protection Authority, New Zealand Fire Service, Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), and health services.

The number of ACC claims for injuries has reduced from 557 in 2007, to 493 in 2013. The number of Fire Service calls over and above the daily average has reduced from 618 in 2007, to 418 in 2013. The number of fires with fireworks as the source of ignition has reduced from 265 in 2007, to 187 in 2013. The number of hospital admission injuries caused by the discharge of fireworks as recorded by the Injury Protection Research Unit at Otago University has reduced from 13 in 2007, to seven in 2012 (being the latest data).

“The downward trend over the past six years in injuries and fires from the use of fireworks is encouraging. However, any significant increase would trigger a revision and the consideration of tighter regulations,” Dr Smith concluded. 

**Notes:**

Fireworks are regulated under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act and administered by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA).

The public is also encouraged to follow the Fire Service’s guidelines around the safe use of fireworks.

All fireworks available for sale to the public are tested according to strict standards. The EPA and WorkSafe NZ are working closely together to ensure that every batch of fireworks has been tested and has a test certificate.

Test certifiers are independent professionals who are approved by WorkSafe NZ under delegation from the EPA.
