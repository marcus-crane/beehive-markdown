Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says the second tranche of the Gallipoli 2015 ballot is underway, with just over 300 double passes to next year’s Anzac Day commemorations reallocated this week.

As of Monday 10 November, 632 double passes were accepted and 313 were reallocated to people on the wait list.

Successful applicants in the first tranche of the ballot, announced on 31 March, had until 25 October to accept the offer of two attendance passes and confirm travel arrangements.

Mr Foss says some passes were declined for health or financial reasons, while some people chose to accept only one attendance pass.

“The Gallipoli 2015 ballot office has worked hard to ensure those successful in the ballot have been kept informed and had every opportunity to accept their passes, with regular email reminders, e-newsletters, mailed letters and direct telephone contact,” Mr Foss says.

“The office is now following up with 40 people for reasons such as delays in obtaining new passports.”

The first tranche of successful applicants now have until 11:59pm (NZST) on 25 November to complete their accompanying person’s details.

Those reallocated passes this week have until 11:59pm (NZST) on 7 December to complete their details and the details of their accompanying person.

Attendance passes will be printed with passport details and delivered by mail in late February or early March 2015.

Mr Foss says anyone with queries regarding their application should contact the Gallipoli 2015 ballot office by emailing [info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz](mailto:info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz) or calling 0800 336 547.
