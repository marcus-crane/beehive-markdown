Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has presented Corrections’ inaugural Partner of the Year award to Housing New Zealand.

The award recognises the joint initiative which sees prisoners at Spring Hill Corrections Facility and Rolleston Prison work to refurbish houses for Housing NZ.

“The innovative partnership between Corrections and Housing NZ is a ‘win win’ for both agencies,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga. “Offenders gain valuable skills, qualifications and work experience, while Housing NZ has its houses repaired and refurbished.

“Around 95 per cent of Housing NZ’s housing stock in Canterbury was damaged in the earthquakes. Over the next four years 150 of those houses will be refurbished at Rolleston Prison.”

Sixty prisoners at any one time will work in the construction yard at Rolleston Prison refurbishing houses, along with offenders from the community.

“The vast majority of prisoners are eventually released and go back to live in the community. Their new skills, qualifications and work experience will help them gain real jobs,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Our government has committed to skilled workplaces, infrastructure and rebuilding Canterbury. More than this, we have committed to bringing down crime. This project ticks all these boxes.

Rolleston Prison is one of three working prisons, where prisoners take part in work, education or training for 40 hours a week. The government is committed to transforming all prisons into working prisons.

Mr Lotu-Iiga presented Corrections’ Partner of the Year award to Housing NZ Chief Executive Glen Sowry at a function in Wellington today (4 November).
