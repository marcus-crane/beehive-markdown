Youth Minister Nikki Kaye has today announced the successful applicants for Youth Fund 2015.

Youth Fund supports youth led and designed projects that enable young people to develop decision-making and leadership skills, and engage with and contribute to their communities.

“I am pleased to announce that 47 projects will be supported in 2015. These encompass everything from the performing arts and leadership workshops, to environmental projects and community events,” Ms Kaye says. “Initiatives for disabled youth are also included.”

“This is a great way for young people to develop their own personal skills and knowledge, while at the same time giving something to the communities that they’re a part of.

“The Youth Fund supports youth-driven projects, and because of that it is really important that young people are the ones who recommend which projects should get funding.

“Panels of young people met across the country to assess applications. All panel members had undergone Ministry of Youth Development training on providing input in government decisions that affect them.”

The Youth Fund was launched in 2010 and is an ongoing fund supporting young people and their communities. In 2014, the Youth Fund supported over 7,400 young people.
