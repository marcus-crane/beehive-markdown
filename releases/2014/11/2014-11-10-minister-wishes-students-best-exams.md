Education Minister Hekia Parata has offered her best wishes to the 143,000 students sitting NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship examinations.

“This is an exciting time because it’s the culmination of many months of hard work and study, but it can also be stressful and demanding.

“I congratulate these students for all their work so far and wish them all the very best over the next three weeks.

“I know that parents will be doing everything they can to support their kids over the coming days, just as they have done throughout their lives.

“I really want to acknowledge them for that because the involvement of parents is so critical to kids being able to do their best.

“Teachers and principals also do a fantastic job and I thank them for the commitment and dedication that they show in schools around the country every day.”

Ms Parata says the Government is backing the profession and parents to help kids to succeed with its continued investment in education.

“We’re spending more than ever on education and have increased spending in schools by over $600 million.

“We’re also putting $359 million into the Investing in Educational Success Initiative, which is going to boost the quality of teaching and leadership in schools, and will see communities of schools form to focus on lifting educational achievement.”
