Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to Paris tomorrow to represent the New Zealand Government at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-level policy forum on migration.

The theme of this year’s forum is mobilising migrants’ skills for economic success and Mr Woodhouse will Chair the Forum’s second session on *Building public confidence in migration issues*, as well as speak to this theme.

“The Forum presents an excellent opportunity to share New Zealand’s experiences with the other 33 OECD member countries around the world,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“We offer extremely flexible business immigration policies and a low-regulation business environment that have contributed to the increase in net migration over the past couple of years.

“I look forward engaging with my international counterparts and sharing New Zealand’s success story in the Immigration space.”

Mr Woodhouse will also travel to Manila where he will visit the Immigration New Zealand Office and meet with Filipino Ministers and officials to build on our excellent bilateral relationship as the Philippines prepare to host APEC next year.

Mr Woodhouse departs New Zealand on Saturday 29 November and returns on Saturday 6 December.
