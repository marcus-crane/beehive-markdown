Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today officially opened the New Zealand Blood Service’s new state-of-the-art Christchurch Blood Centre.

“This modern facility in Addington is essential in maintaining New Zealand’s self-sufficiency in blood and blood products, and it is another important step in restoring Christchurch’s infrastructure,” says Dr Coleman.

The $26 million centre will process all the blood collected in the South Island and replaces the Riccarton Road facility which is no longer fit for purpose.

The new centre incorporates new technologies and with 19 donor beds compared with 10 in the old centre can accommodate more donors.

It will also provide diagnostic testing and support services to the health sector, and skin and bone banking services.

“The New Zealand Blood Service has been a vital part of the health sector since its establishment in 1998, with around 42,000 Kiwis needing blood or blood products every year which are generously donated by volunteers across the country,” says Dr Coleman.

“The New Zealand Blood Service does a fantastic job ensuring that these donations are available when and where they are needed.”
