Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today announced the Government is co-investing in two new projects as part of the Tourism Growth Partnership.

The Tourism Growth Partnership is a $32 million contestable Government fund which aims to support innovation and productivity in the tourism sector. For each project approved for investment, the Government provides up to 50 per cent of the required funding.

The successful applicants in the second round of funding are Christchurch International Airport’s Welcome China Project, which will receive $270,000 in funding, and Southern World Vacation’s Limited which will receive $112,950.

“These are two great initiatives which will help increase visitor numbers,” says Mr Key.

“Christchurch International Airport’s Welcome China programme will improve visitor flows, support visitor recovery and therefore increase financial contributions to the Canterbury region and the tourism industry.

“Southern World has partnered with an established North American-based safari company to lift New Zealand’s profile and attract more high value sports hunters and fishing enthusiasts.”

Mr Key says applications are now open for the third round of Tourism Growth Partnership funding.

“Investing in a wide range of innovative tourism projects will help New Zealand tourism as a whole and help create more jobs in New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

Applications for the third funding round close on December 1, 2014.
