Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat David Strachan as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to the Philippines.

“The Philippines market is important for New Zealand. Last year New Zealand exported over $750 million of goods to the Philippines, and it is one of New Zealand's top five markets for dairy products,” Mr McCully says.

“The trade and economic relationship is underpinned by the ASEAN-New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, a high quality agreement making trade and investment easier for businesses on both sides.

“Filipino skilled migrants also play an important role in the New Zealand economy by working on the rebuild of Christchurch, in the dairy industry, and the health care sector. More than 40,000 Filipinos are now living in New Zealand, making it the largest community from any ASEAN nation.

“New Zealand was one of the many countries to offer help in the face of devastating typhoon Haiyan which hit the Philippines last November and we will continue to support the Philippines as the country rebuilds,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Strachan is currently Ambassador to Egypt and has previously served in Jakarta, Seoul, Port Moresby and Kuala Lumpur.
