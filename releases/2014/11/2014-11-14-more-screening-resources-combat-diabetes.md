Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more Kiwis are being screened for diabetes, and more support is being offered to those living with the condition.

“Diabetes is one of our most significant health challenges affecting more than 240,000 New Zealanders, with many more at-risk or undiagnosed,” says Dr Coleman.

“That’s why we need to maintain our focus on detecting diabetes through the ‘More Heart and Diabetes Checks’ target, as well as ensuring our healthcare staff have the resources they need to address this modern epidemic.”

Record numbers of diabetes and heart checks – around 1.1 million - have been carried out in the last five years with patients receiving advice on how they can make healthy changes to their lifestyle.

To coincide with World Diabetes Day today the Ministry of Health has produced a suite of resources for health staff and people living with diabetes, including:

- A toolkit setting out the standards of care DHBs and their primary care partners should provide.
- Advice on self-management support for people with diabetes.
- Information on preventing diabetes when the initial warning signs have been flagged.

“These resources will make a significant contribution to reducing the impact of diabetes in our communities and ensuring people affected by diabetes can access the highest quality care and support to manage their condition,” says Dr Coleman.

“The toolkit will enable DHBs to assess how well they are doing in providing patient-focused diabetes care based around 20 quality standards, from patient education through to access to specialist care. It will help guide the delivery of first-class services and help ensure equity and consistency for patients wherever they live.”

The materials have been published alongside the national diabetes programme work plan, which also maintains a focus on diabetes prevention, including an extension of ‘green prescriptions’ which provide advice on being active and maintaining good health.
