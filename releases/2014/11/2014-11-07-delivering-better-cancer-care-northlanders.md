Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today opened the Jim Carney Cancer Treatment Centre in Whangarei. 

“The Government is focused on ensuring New Zealanders have timely access to the best possible cancer care close to home,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new Jim Carney Cancer Treatment Centre means that Northlanders will now be able to receive more complex treatments by local clinicians in one purpose built facility.

“The new $5 million centre is the result of collaboration between Northland DHB and the local community, led by the Northland Community Foundation.”

Under the Government’s new national health target, from 1 October 2014 people with suspected cancer will get faster tests and treatment.

“We know that prompt treatment is more likely to ensure better outcomes for patients. Under the new target, 90 per cent of patients are to receive their first cancer treatment within 62 days of referral,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new target builds on the gains made over the past five years and will provide New Zealanders with faster cancer services.”

The Government has invested almost $63 million on the faster cancer treatment programme over the last 6 years. This includes funding in 2012 for up to $4 million a year to recruit specialist cancer nurse coordinators. There are now 60 cancer nurse coordinators working in full and part-time positions across DHBs.

“Recently published evaluation reports on the first year of the cancer nurse coordinators role show the initiative is delivering good results,” says Dr Coleman.

“Cancer nurse coordinators are improving the cancer care experience of patients. They are becoming the ‘go to’ people, providing information and support to ensure patients get the greatest benefit from their care and treatment from the outset.”
