Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed the latest release of figures from Statistics New Zealand which shows the highest number of building consents issued in more than six years.

“There were 24,307 consents issued nationwide in the year to October 2014 – an increase of 21 per cent on the same period last year, and more than any other 12-month period since the year to May 2008,” Dr Smith says.

“There is further good news to be reported with the positive trend of growth seen in the two cities where the housing challenge is most acute. The 591 consents issued in Auckland in October represent a 10 per cent increase on the number issued the previous month, and bring the total for the year to October to 7435 – 31 per cent more than the number issued in the same period last year.

“Meanwhile, there were 425 consents issued in Christchurch last month – 18 per cent more than the previous month. The 4099 consents issued in Christchurch in the year to October is an increase of 89 per cent on the previous year.

“Today’s figures come on the back the first year report of the Auckland Housing Accord which I released with Mayor Len Brown this week, and which showed the Government – together with Auckland Council – exceeded its first year target for new sections and dwellings by more than 20 per cent.

“The figures are the latest proof that the Government’s reforms to improve housing supply and affordability are working. Under National, there are 66 per cent more building consents being issued each month in Auckland as compared to 2008, and 218 per cent more being issued in Christchurch.

“We are freeing up land supply, reducing building material costs, reining in development contributions, cutting compliance costs, and investing in skills and productivity in the construction sector.

“We need to keep our foot on the accelerator, and the Government is committed to supporting this momentum with the planned second phase of the Resource Management Act reforms, and the new HomeStart scheme to support first home buyers coming into effect 1 April next year.”
