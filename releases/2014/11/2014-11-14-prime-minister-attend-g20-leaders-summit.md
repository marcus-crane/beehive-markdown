Prime Minister John Key is attending the G20 Leaders’ Summit as an invited guest and will travel to Brisbane tomorrow.

“It’s an honour to have been invited as a guest of Australia and I’m proud New Zealand will be represented alongside the G20 nations,” says Mr Key

Finance Minister Bill English has also been invited to participate and will attend the B20 summit involving Finance Ministers from the G20 nations.

“This year’s G20 will cover a range of global economic issues, notably strengthening growth and job creation and building global economic resilience. These themes fit New Zealand’s own economic priorities.”

The G20 economies make up 85 percent of global economic activity and 75 percent of global trade. Fourteen of New Zealand’s top 20 bilateral trading partners are at the G20 meeting.

“New Zealand’s economic prospects are closely intertwined with those of G20 member countries,” says Mr Key.

New Zealand is not a formal member of the G20 grouping because of its size but has been involved in a full year of engagements culminating in the forthcoming final meeting as an invited guest of Australia.

“I intend to use my participation in the Leaders’ Summit to get a sense of global leaders’ economic concerns and how they are responding to these challenges,” says Mr Key.

The Summit also provides an opportunity to promote New Zealand’s economic policy credentials and raise our profile as a good place to do trade and do business.

“As well as attending all the main leaders’ events, I look forward to engaging bilaterally with counterparts from the G20 and supporting Prime Minister Abbott in delivering a successful G20 presidency,” says Mr Key.

The Prime Minister departs for Brisbane on Saturday 15 November and returns 16 November.

Note: The G20 grouping includes Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Indonesia, India, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, European Union.
