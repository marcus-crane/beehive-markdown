Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced the reinstatement of New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Fiji.

“New Zealand has had an acting High Commissioner since 2007, and this announcement is an important step in re-building our relationship with Fiji,” Mr McCully says.

“The new High Commissioner will be diplomat Mark Ramsden, who has been the Acting High Commissioner in Suva since September 2013.

“The reinstatement of our High Commissioner reflects the further normalisation of our relationship with Fiji and will enable us to better engage with Fiji on economic, trade and regional issues,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Ramsden has extensive experience in the Pacific and has previously served as High Commissioner to Solomon Islands and Deputy High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, as well as being posted to Vanuatu.
