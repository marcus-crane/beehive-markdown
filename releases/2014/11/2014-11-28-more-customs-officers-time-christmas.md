Customs Minister Nicky Wagner congratulates the twenty seven new Customs officers who are graduating in Auckland today, in time to boost border security at Auckland Airport for the busy summer season.

“These Customs officers will start their career at the busiest time of the year in the busiest place at the border. Their role is a unique and crucial one – both protecting and promoting New Zealand,” Ms Wagner said.

“Customs officers are expected to provide top service, as they are a passenger’s first and last impression of New Zealand. At the same time, they have to be vigilant and focused on passengers who could present a threat to New Zealand.

“Around 2.1 million passengers are expected to travel in and out of New Zealand during December and January, with 75 per cent passing through Auckland Airport. This is about a four per cent increase compared to last year.

“With travel volumes expected to grow by 13.5 per cent in the next four years, Customs is continuing to invest in border management technology, and expanding the use of automated border processing, SmartGate, to meet this increase.

“While Customs uses cutting edge innovation and technology to support its work, its officers will always be the most important part of New Zealand’s frontline. I congratulate the new graduates on their chosen career path,” Ms Wagner said.
