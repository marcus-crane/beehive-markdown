Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will increase its humanitarian support for refugees from Syria and Iraq and ramp up diplomatic efforts to address the rise of ISIL.

“Unrest and violence caused by ISIL is making the already pressing humanitarian crisis in Syria and Iraq far worse,” Mr McCully says.

“Millions of people have fled their homes as the result of on-going violence in Iraq and Syria, and New Zealand has provided $13.5 million to help address their plight.

“Today we have announced a further $1 million to help those forced from their homes and support the countries which they have fled to.

“The scale of this crisis and the brutality of ISIL have long term implications for the region and we must support the international effort to help those most in need. Our aid and diplomatic effort will also concentrate on helping to contain the spread of ISIL’s vicious ideology.

“During our upcoming term on the United Nations Security Council we will focus our efforts on addressing the longstanding issues in the Middle East that are a source of radicalisation for some individuals and threats to regional stability.  

“Closer to home our friends and neighbours have populations that could become targets for extremist recruiters. We are aware that these countries are looking to address this threat and New Zealand will continue to help develop a more focused and effective regional counterterrorism programme,” Mr McCully says.
