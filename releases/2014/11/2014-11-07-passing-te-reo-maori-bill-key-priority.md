The Minister for Māori Development is committed to progressing the Māori Language (Te Reo Maori) Bill and the establishment of a new entity Te Mātāwai to lead the revitalisation of te reo Māori.

“I support the principle of the legislation that iwi and Māori should lead the revitalisation of te reo Māori. We must have whānau, hapū and iwi at the helm if we are to hear and see our language thriving again,” says Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

He says that the last month has provided an opportunity to take stock of the progress for the Māori Language (Te Reo Māori) Bill and as a result it is likely that the Bill requires some refinement.

“My focus is on working constructively with those who would like to see some changes to the implementation of Te Mātāwai and consolidate a pathway forward,” says Mr Flavell.

He is pleased that the Māori Affairs Select Committee has extended the public submission period for the Bill to 5 December, allowing more people with an interest in te reo Māori to provide additional feedback. The Māori Affairs Select Committee will report back to Parliament in March.

Mr Flavell will also set up a small independent advisory group to assist him with the review of submissions from the Select Committee and the advancement of the bill.

“As the responsible Minister I’m looking forward to receiving advice about the matters raised by the Māori Affairs Select Committee report, submitters and those who will be impacted by the Bill,” says Mr Flavell.

He is committed to ensuring the bill is passed in this Parliamentary term.
