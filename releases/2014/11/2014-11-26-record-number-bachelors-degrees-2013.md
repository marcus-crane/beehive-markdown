An annual report on the performance of the tertiary sector confirms that the number of domestic students who completed bachelors degrees in 2013 is the highest ever, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

*Profile & Trends 2013*, released today by the Ministry of Education, showed that last year 26,200 bachelors degrees were completed by domestic students, up 4,950 since 2010 – an increase of 23 per cent.

The increase includes dramatic growth in the number of degrees completed by Māori and Pasifika students.  The number of bachelors degrees completed since 2010 has increased by 46 per cent for Māori students and by 52 per cent for Pasifika students.

“I’m delighted that more New Zealanders than ever before are studying towards higher qualifications and that we are continuing to build a more qualified workforce,” Mr Joyce says. “This is not only good for the economy but it’s good for individuals, families and communities.

The report shows that New Zealanders with a bachelors degree or higher qualifications are earning 62 per cent more than people with no qualification. People with a tertiary qualification are also less likely to be unemployed than those with no qualifications.

“The tertiary education system is essential to building our skills and productivity,” Mr Joyce says. “As the New Zealand economy becomes more technology focussed the demand for highly skilled workers is only going to increase. A big part of our tertiary education push is to achieve better results at higher levels for young New Zealanders.”
