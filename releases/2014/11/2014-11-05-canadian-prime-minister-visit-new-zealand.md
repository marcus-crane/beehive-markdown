Prime Minister John Key has announced Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will make an official visit to New Zealand next week.

The Rt Hon Stephen Harper, the first Canadian leader to visit here in almost 20 years, will be in Auckland for official talks and engagements on Friday 14 November, prior to his travel to the G20 meeting in Australia.

“New Zealand and Canada have a longstanding and warm relationship which has seen us work closely together over many years,” says Mr Key.

“I look forward to meeting with the Prime Minister. We will discuss a range of international issues of mutual interest such as New Zealand’s recent appointment to the United Nations Security Council.”

The Canadian Prime Minister will be formally welcomed at Government House, participate in a wreath laying ceremony at the Auckland War Memorial Museum and attend the bilateral talks.

Prime Minister Key visited Canada in 2010.
