Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government will upgrade New Zealand’s therapeutic products regulation following the decision not to proceed with a joint regulator with Australia.

“Both Governments have agreed that a joint regulator has been thoroughly explored, but in the end respective interests are best served by separate therapeutic regimes,” says Dr Coleman.

“I have asked the Ministry of Health to develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme for therapeutic products in New Zealand.

“It is important we modernise our regulation of medicines. There are benefits in bringing medicines, devices, cell and tissue therapies under a single cost effective regulatory framework.

“Other countries are increasingly looking for assurances about health and safety of therapeutic products. We are committed to maintaining standards in line with international best practice.”

The joint decision by Australia and New Zealand to cease efforts to establish the Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Agency (ANZTPA) was made after a comprehensive review of the costs and benefits to both countries.

New Zealand and Australia will continue to cooperate in areas which will deliver mutual benefits to consumers, businesses and regulators – including developing a new information sharing arrangement, and formalising mutual recognition of good manufacturing practice audits.
