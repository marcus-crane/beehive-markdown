Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew have received the final report from the Government’s inquiry into the whey protein concentrate contamination incident last year.

Ministers will now consider the report and its recommendations. The report will be released along with the Government’s response within the next few weeks.

This part of the inquiry looks at how the potentially contaminated whey protein concentrate entered the New Zealand and international market, and how this was subsequently addressed.

The earlier inquiry report looked at regulatory and best practice requirements for food safety against the background of this incident. That report confirmed that New Zealand had a world leading food safety system. It was officially released on 11 December 2013 with the Government accepting all 29 recommendations.  

The Government’s inquiry was headed by Miriam Dean CNZM QC, assisted by Tony Nowell CNZM and Dr Anne Astin PSM.
