Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne says patients who take part in a new survey about their stay in hospital are performing an important service. Developed by the Health Quality & Safety Commission, the survey has been sent to patients randomly selected across the country that spent at least one night in hospital from 3 to 16 November.

Responses from patients invited to participate will be collated to give each of the country’s district health boards (DHBs) a rating out of 10 in four areas: coordination, partnership, communications, and meeting physical and emotional needs.

“As well as helping DHBs make improvements in care, these results give the public valuable insights into how their local health services are performing” says Mr Dunne.

“The first of the Commission’s patient surveys, for the period 4 to 17 August, gave an average rating of 8 out of 10 for each of the four areas.

“There were over 1500 responses, about a quarter of patients contacted, which was a good start, but the Commission is now working with DHBs to increase that figure for this important tool”, Mr Dunne said.

Survey responses are anonymous unless patients choose to supply contact details. Patients can fill in the survey online using a computer, tablet or smartphone, or can post their response back.

All DHBs are sending the survey to patients at least once every three months, with some also surveying patients weekly or fortnightly.

The Commission released results from the first survey in early November: [http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/news-and-events/media/1852/](http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/news-and-events/media/1852/).
