Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the vote of secondary teachers in favour of new roles being added to their collective agreement.

Ms Parata says the support for the new roles of Community of School Teachers is another significant step forward for the $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative.

“I’m extremely pleased that secondary teachers have seen the exciting opportunities presented by these new teaching roles, both in terms of lifting student achievement and for their own career pathways.

“The PPTA has worked alongside the Ministry of Education and others in the sector to finalise these roles and other aspects of this initiative.  I want to thank them for their hard work and commitment.”

Ms Parata says more than 50 expressions of interest have been received to form communities of schools, and the first of them will be operating from Term One of 2015.

“It’s a tremendous way to start the school year, and I know that we will have growing interest from around the country as teachers, parents and students see IES in action and what it has to offer them.”
