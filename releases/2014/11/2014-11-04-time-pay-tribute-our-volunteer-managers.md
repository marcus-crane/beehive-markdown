Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew will be celebrating International Day for Volunteer Managers tomorrow.

“The fifth of November is more than just a day for fireworks. For the last 15 years it is also a day for recognising the hard work and dedication of those Volunteer Managers that drive the voluntary sector,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Volunteer managers bring a passion to the voluntary sector, ensuring New Zealand’s over one million volunteers feel supported and rewarded for the work they do in the community,” she said.

International Day for Volunteer Managers is a separate celebration to International Volunteer day, which falls on 5 December.

“It is right that we individually recognise the work these leaders do for our communities and our volunteers, much of which is carried out behind the scenes,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Our volunteers work across community groups, contributing 1.8 million hours of their time each week providing services that New Zealanders could not do without,” she said.

The International Volunteer Managers Day theme for 2014 is inspired by the whakatauki *Ki te kahore he whakakitenga ka ngaro te iw,* which means *Without foresight or vision the people will be lost.*

Mrs Goodhew also thanked Volunteering New Zealand for providing support, professional development and training to volunteer managers.
