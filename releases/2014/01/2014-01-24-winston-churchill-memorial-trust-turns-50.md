Community and Voluntary sector Minister Jo Goodhew has today congratulated the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust as they celebrate their golden anniversary.

“I congratulate the Trust on this significant milestone, it is a testament to its enduring success,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The Trust was established in 1965 based on the belief of Sir Winston Churchill that enormous good would come from ordinary people experiencing other cultures.

“In his honour, the Trust assists New Zealanders to travel overseas to learn more about other cultures and to investigate topics that will help them to increase their contribution to their community, industry or calling.

“The Trust has played an important role in building strong leaders across a vast range of disciplines. Recipients grow in confidence and understanding and come back to New Zealand inspired,” says Mrs Goodhew.

In 2012, the Trust launched the McNeish Writer’s Fellowships, in honour of Sir James and Lady McNeish, which enables promising writers and journalists to travel and live in another culture. 

To date, the Trust has benefited 800 New Zealand Fellows. The Trust also operates in the United Kingdom and Australia.
