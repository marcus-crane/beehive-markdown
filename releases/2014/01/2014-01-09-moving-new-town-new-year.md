If you're moving to a new town this new year, shifting your medical records from one general practice to another is now a lot easier.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says transferring medical records between GPs can be a lengthy process, but now all general practices can use a secure electronic system called GP2GP to make the process faster and easier.

“In the past when patients changed doctors, their medical records would have to be printed out or photocopied, mailed to the new practice. They then had to be re-entered into the new practices electronic patient management system.

“GP2GP allows different practice management systems to ‘talk’ to each other, meaning patient records can now be transferred securely at the touch of a button,” says Mr Ryall.

Wellington GP Chris Masters now receives all the information he needs about new patients before they even turn up for their first appointments.

“Registering new people into the practice is so much easier with GP2GP,” says Dr Masters.

“It means we can catch up on screening and any tests a patient might be due for much more quickly. I also know in advance if a patient is likely to need more of my attention - if they’re a diabetic, for instance.”

GP2GP was funded by this government and is now being used by more than 80 per cent of general practices. Nearly 220,000 files were transferred electronically through the system last year.
