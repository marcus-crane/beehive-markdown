Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today announced the Government is investing $2.3 million over five years to support the public health workforce. 

“A recent study found that only twenty-nine per cent of the public health workforce holds a generic public health qualification, and that most public health qualifications are only offered at postgraduate level,” says Mrs Goodhew.

"It is important that those working in public health hold appropriate formal public health qualifications because it enables increased knowledge and expertise, as well as consistent standards of practice.

“From next month a new National Certificate in Public Health will be available. Developed by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the public health and tertiary education sector, the Certificate is designed to be a minimum foundation qualification for those working in public health.

“To support uptake of the Certificate, a number of fees grants and travel subsidies have been made available to eligible students.

"The Certificate will ensure the workforce has sufficient knowledge and practical skills to develop and implement public health initiatives to improve population health outcomes overall, and help to address health needs for vulnerable people,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The newly established Certificate was accredited by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority in 2012 and will be delivered by Massey University.

Applications for fees grants for 2014 close next week. Further information can be found at [www.publichealthworkforce.org.nz](http://www.publichealthworkforce.org.nz)
