Hon Tariana Turia, the Associate Minister of Health has released ‘Wharekauri, Rēkohu, Chatham Islands Health and Social Needs’ at a community hui on the Chatham Islands. The report provides an overview of the health and social needs of the Chatham Islanders and the services that are available to meet them. It identifies gaps in the services and discusses options to address these.

Mrs Turia says “To live in a remote rural area is always a challenge for communities and the services that are provided for them. This report will provide a resource for government agencies providing services on the Islands to help them to better respond to the needs of whānau/family”.

The report shows that the primary health services on the Islands are good and there is regular access to secondary services. These are strongly supported by services provided by Māori Community Services (part of Ha O Te Ora O Wharekauri Trust). There is a wide range of social services available or accessible on the Islands. Local organisations were actively involved in exploring ways to develop the economy and there was a strong sense of whānau cohesion in the community.

The report highlighted a number of service gaps that currently exist for the community. These include the need for earlier and more effective response to mental health issues, drug and alcohol addictions, behavioural issues, and family violence. Whānau expressed their concern whether care for people with disabilities and palliative care is appropriate. The availability of quality housing is limited and the cost of living is high for many residents.

Wharekauri, Rēkohu, Chatham Islands Health and Social Needs was funded by the Ministry of Health and prepared by Litmus, a social research company.
