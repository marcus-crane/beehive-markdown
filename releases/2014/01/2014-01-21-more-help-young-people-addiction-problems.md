More young people with alcohol, drug and other addiction problems will receive the help and support they need thanks to an almost $3 million investment from the government.

Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Health Minister Todd McClay have today announced extra funding for youth addiction services at Northland and Southern District Health Boards (DHBs).

Mr Ryall said both DHBs will receive $860,000 to build on existing youth addiction services in Dunedin, rural Otago, Southland, Whangarei and Kaitaia.

“In addition, a further $1.1 million will be divided between Whanganui, Bay of Plenty, Capital and Coast and Waikato DHBs to expand their youth addiction services,” says Mr Ryall.

“This extra funding will enhance current services and see stronger linkages between addiction services, mental health professionals and community health services, such as general practices,” says Mr McClay.

“We want young people to have the best opportunities in life. This is another example of our commitment to ensuring young people have the support and services available to them when they need them”, says Mr McClay.

The decision to award Northland and Southern DHBs contracts for enhanced Youth Addiction Treatment Services came after a registration of interest process. Six proposals were shortlisted, with all receiving additional funding.

The funding comes from the Drivers of Crime investment package, which delivers $10m annually from alcohol excise revenue, to increase alcohol and other drug assessments and interventions, and associated training activities across justice and health settings.
