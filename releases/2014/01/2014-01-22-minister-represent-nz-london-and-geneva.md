Justice Minister Judith Collins leaves today to meet with her UK justice counterparts in London. Ms Collins will then present New Zealand’s report for the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) on Human Rights to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

This is the second time New Zealand will present its UPR on Human Rights - the first was in 2009. All 193 UN member countries are required to be examined and report on their human rights performance every four and a half years.

Ms Collins says the report shows New Zealand has made significant progress in promoting domestic human rights since the first UPR was submitted.

“New Zealand is a proud of our strong human rights record, but there is always room to improve. I’m looking forward to presenting our progress to the Human Rights Council.”

Once submitted, the report is measured against international treaties, as well as the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international humanitarian law and any voluntary commitments New Zealand has made.

Ms Collins will also meet with her counterparts in London including the UK’s Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims Minister Rt Hon Damian Green, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Crime and Security James Brokenshire, and Under-Secretary for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries Ed Vaizey.

A range of issues will be discussed including organised crime, anti-corruption and money laundering, victims’ rights and cyber-bullying - including New Zealand’s Harmful Digital Communications Bill.

“New Zealand can benefit from learning about the experiences of the United Kingdom on these evolving global issues. We are not immune to these threats so a global approach in sharing information is invaluable.”
