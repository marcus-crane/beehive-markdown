Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today condemned the resumption of so-called “scientific” whaling in the Southern Ocean.

“Today’s information suggests the Japanese fleet has commenced whaling for the current season,” Mr McCully says.

“The practice of whaling in the oceans south of New Zealand is pointless and offensive to a great many New Zealanders.

“The New Zealand Government has repeatedly called on Japan to end its whaling programme. We reiterate this message today.”

New Zealand has formally lodged an intervention before the International Court of Justice in the case brought by Australia against Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. The case is still before the court.

Mr McCully says reports by Sea Shepherd that whaling occurred in New Zealand sovereign waters are factually wrong.

“New Zealand has responsibility for co-ordinating search and rescue operations in a large area in the Southern Ocean, however these are international waters and not within New Zealand’s maritime jurisdiction.”
