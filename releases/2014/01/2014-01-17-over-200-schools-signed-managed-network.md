Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye say 212 schools have signed agreements to connect to the Network for Learning (N4L) managed network.

“The pace of connecting schools is gaining momentum. As of today, 212 schools have signed agreements and these communities will be looking forward to being connected in the near future,” Ms Parata says.

“This is great news for our children as they begin the new schooling year over the next couple of weeks.

“Their learning is the most critical element in education and we want to ensure we are supporting their needs in a technologically savvy environment,” Ms Parata says.

“All these schools are expected to connect to the managed network within the next few months,” Ms Kaye says.

“Forty-nine of these schools have already connected and are now able to take full advantage of the Government funded connection provided by the N4L managed network.

“Through the managed network, the Government is picking up the cost to provide schools with safe, predictable and fast internet with uncapped data, content filtering and network security services.

“This package reduces ICT complexity and provides significant savings for schools. All schools will be invited to connect to the managed network by the end of 2016.

“This progress is ahead of schedule and means the company is well placed to connect at least 700 schools by the end of 2014 as expected,” Ms Kaye says.

The Government has committed $211 million over eight years to establish the managed network and provide schools with a funded connection to it.

The N4L network runs over the best mix of ultra-fast, rural, and remote broadband available in New Zealand.

Schools that have signed agreements to connect and those currently connected are listed on the N4L website, see:
