Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the government is investing an extra $10 million to provide more New Zealanders with elective surgery over the next five months.

“This government has lifted the number of patients receiving elective surgery from 118,000 in 2007/08 to 158,000 last year – but we want even more New Zealanders to benefit from surgery,” said Mr Ryall.

“This funding will mean over 1,800 extra patients will receive elective surgery by the middle of this year.

“A third of the operations will be orthopaedic surgery, including knee and hip joint replacements. The rest will be a mix of general surgery, ophthalmology operations, including cataracts, and ears, nose and throat operations.

“We have identified specialties where public hospitals can do even better and every district health board will receive extra funding to provide even more patients with the surgery they need.

“Elective surgery makes a real difference to patients and their families – it reduces pain, increases independence and improves their quality of life.

“This increased funding will build on the record numbers of elective operations achieved by the National-led Government,” says Mr Ryall.
