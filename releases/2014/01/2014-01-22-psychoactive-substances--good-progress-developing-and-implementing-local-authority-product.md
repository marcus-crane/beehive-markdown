Associate Health Minister Todd McClay has welcomed the ongoing work of local authorities in developing local authority product plans (LAPPs).

There are currently 22 LAPPs in various stages of development, with Napier’s policy coming into effect late last year. This has resulted in the declining of a retail licence under consideration by the Psychoactive Substances Regulatory Authority (the Authority) in the Napier area.

“I applaud Napier for being the first local authority to implement an LAPP. That Napier’s Plan has resulted in the declining of an interim licence application shows that these policies do have teeth, which is exactly the reason the government included the mechanism in the Psychoactive Substances Act”, says Mr McClay.

“The Authority will be writing to all local government chief executives today, reinforcing the role that councils can play through development of LAPPs and offering assistance with the process. All licences, including interim licenses, are required to adhere to LAPPs”.

“If communities have concerns about the operating of legal high retailers in their community, they should approach their local Council. Parliament was determined that Councils have real authority to regulate where these products are sold in their regions and the Psychoactive Substances Act gives them precisely that power”, says Mr McClay.

Further regulations are due for consultation in mid-February. For further information go to [http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/psychoactive-substances](http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/psychoactive-substances)
