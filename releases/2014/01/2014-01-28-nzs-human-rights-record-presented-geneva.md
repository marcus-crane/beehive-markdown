Justice Minister Judith Collins appeared before the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva last night to discuss New Zealand’s progress in promoting and protecting human rights.

“New Zealand is internationally recognised for its long-standing commitment to improving human rights and has much to be proud of and to celebrate,” Ms Collins says.

“The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process gives New Zealand the opportunity to discuss our human rights achievements and reflect on the challenges we must address to continue to be a world leader in this area.”

This is New Zealand’s second UPR, with the first in 2009. All 193 UN member countries are required to be examined and report on their human rights performance every four and a half years.

In her presentation, Ms Collins outlined some of New Zealand’s achievements, including work on protecting vulnerable children, and the challenges, such as people’s rights during the recovery from the Canterbury earthquakes.

“New Zealand will now take the time to evaluate all recommendations and feedback provided by the UNHRC member states,” Ms Collins says.

A copy of New Zealand’s National Report and an archived webcast of New Zealand’s appearance at the Universal Periodic Review will be available on the UPR website:  [http://www.upr-info.org](http://www.upr-info.org/)
