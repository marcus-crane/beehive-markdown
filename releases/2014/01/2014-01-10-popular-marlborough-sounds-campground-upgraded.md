Conservation Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed a $2.2 million upgrade to the DOC campsite at Momorangi Bay in Queen Charlotte Sound.

“This investment illustrates the Government’s commitment to protecting and enhancing the classic Kiwi camping experience. We are building more campgrounds and enhancing facilities at existing campgrounds like Momorangi to ensure families for generations to come can enjoy the great outdoors,” Dr Smith says.

“These upgrades at Momorangi Bay mean the 23,500 people who stay at the campground each year can now look forward to an even better experience in this jewel of the Marlborough Sounds.

“Work has already been completed on the first $500,000 phase that has upgraded the café, toilets and water storage and treatment for the campsite. It has also added a new single-lane road bridge to improve safety and access.”

A second phase of upgrades is planned for after the busy summer season, including installing new amenities such as showers and a swimming platform, while the camp roads will be tarsealed, the sea wall upgraded and power for the site put underground. This work is expected to be completed by March 2015 and will cost $1.7 million.

Today’s announcement was made at the Meet the Locals family event featuring a kayaking session, treasure hunt and the opportunity to get up close to some rare native wildlife. This was held as part of the new partnership between DOC, Kathmandu Ltd and the Marlborough Sounds Restoration Trust. Participants were given the opportunity to meet with local DOC rangers to learn about native animals and conservation efforts in the area.

Kathmandu is providing support to the Momorangi Bay Conservation Project through $75,000 in sponsorship that will be put towards enhancing the natural landscape values of the campsite and wider area, and enabling campers to enjoy conservation activities during their stay.

“The campground upgrade and adjacent conservation project at Momorangi Bay reflect DOC’s new direction. We are putting a greater emphasis on recreation and ensuring New Zealanders can get out and enjoy the great outdoors at an affordable cost. We are also partnering with businesses like Kathmandu to better protect the native plants and animals that are unique to New Zealand and incorporating conservation advocacy into campgrounds to enhance understanding of DOC’s work,” Dr Smith says.
