Cancer patients can look forward to higher quality care thanks to new national standards which have been developed by cancer experts, including surgeons, oncologists and nurses, for ten common tumour types in New Zealand.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the new standards describe the care and services a person with cancer should have access to, no matter where they live in the country.

“District health boards will compare the services they currently provide with those set out in the standards, to identify where they can make improvements and provide cancer patients with better care,” says Mr Ryall.

The standards cover bowel, breast, gynaecological, haematological (lymphoma and myeloma), head and neck, upper gastrointestinal, melanoma and sarcoma tumours.

“The ten standards are based on the successful lung cancer standards which were developed in 2011 and have helped improve care for lung cancer patients across the country,” says Mr Ryall.

The standards are part of the Government’s $33 million Faster Cancer Treatment programme. The standards will be formally reviewed in five years, to ensure they remain current.

Mr Ryall thanked the cancer experts who developed these standards for their dedication and commitment to improving cancer care in New Zealand.

A copy of the standards are available on the Ministry of Health website
