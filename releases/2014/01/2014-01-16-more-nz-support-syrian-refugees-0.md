Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide a further $5 million to help those displaced by the conflict in Syria.

An estimated 2.3 million refugees have now fled the conflict in Syria and a further 6.5 million are displaced within the country. The number of refugees is expected to grow to 4.1 million by the end of 2014, including 2 million children.

“This latest funding will support UNICEF operations in Jordan and Lebanon and will provide critical education and health services to some of the millions of children affected by the conflict,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Syria and we want to continue to assist those in greatest need.”

New Zealand’s total humanitarian contributions to the Syrian crisis now stand at $12.5 million.
