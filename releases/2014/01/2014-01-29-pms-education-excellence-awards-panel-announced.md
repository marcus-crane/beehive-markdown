Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced members of the expert panel and judging panel for the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“The Prime Minister’s Education Awards provide an opportunity to publicly recognise, celebrate and share highly effective education practice to lift the status of the teaching profession and drive improvements for all children and young people,” Ms Parata says.

“I am delighted to announce the nine members of the judging panel and nine members of the expert panel for these prestigious awards. I’m sure these individuals will be easily recognised as respected leaders and specialists in their fields.”

The members are:

**Judging Panel Members**

- Pem Bird  (Chairman, Nga Kura-a-Iwi o Aotearoa)
- Linda Clark  (Chapman Tripp)
- Sir Peter Gluckman  (Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor)
- Lorraine Kerr  (New Zealand School Trustees Association)
- Tom Parsons  (Secondary Principals Association of New Zealand)
- Distinguished Professor Viviane Robinson  (University of Auckland)
- Ian Taylor  (Animation Research Ltd)
- Professor Helen Timperley  (University of Auckland)
- Emeritus Professor Maualaivao Albert Wendt (University of Auckland)

**Education Expert Panel Members**

- Dr Adrienne Alton-Lee  (Ministry of Education)
- Unasa Enosa Auva’a  (Mt Albert Primary School)
- Steffan Brough  (Education Review Office)
- Professor Judith Duncan  (Canterbury University)
- Scott Haines  (Motueka High School)
- Georgina Kingi  (St Joseph’s Māori Girls College)
- Dr John Langley  (Child, Youth and Family)
- Heather McRae  (Diocesan School for Girls)
- Rawiri Wright (*Te Kura Kaupapa Maori* o Hoani Waititi)

**Convener**

The convenor role for both the panels will be conducted by former Chief Executive and Chief Review Officer, Education Review Office, Dr Graham Stoop, who is now Deputy Secretary – Graduate Achievement, Vocations and Careers at the Ministry of Education.

The education expert panel will review each entry to decide up to four finalists in each of the four categories and prize. The judging panel will visit the finalists to see their entries in action and select winners.

“I know there are many, many examples of highly effective and innovative practice across the profession; however these are not often visible to the public. I look forward to us all having the opportunity to celebrate and share these examples of excellence at the Awards ceremony in June,” Ms Parata says.

“High quality teaching is a key contributor to student achievement. Strengthening the value and raising the status of the teaching profession is an issue that all OECD countries are grappling with, and is the focus of this year’s International Summit on the Teaching Profession, being hosted by New Zealand in collaboration with OECD and Education International 28 and 29 March 2014.

“I am delighted that these respected individuals have agreed to participate in this process, making a valuable contribution to lifting the status and prestige of the profession and driving education improvement for all children and young people.”
