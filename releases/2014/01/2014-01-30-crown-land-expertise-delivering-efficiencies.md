The Crown Land Centre of Expertise has now signed a memorandum of understanding with seven public sector agencies, Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The centre was established within Land Information New Zealand as part of the Government’s drive for agencies to assume leadership roles in areas in which they have expertise.

It uses LINZ’s expertise and innovation to support and advise a growing number of Crown agencies on the management and, where required, the disposal of surplus Crown land.

“In the year since it was established, the centre has signed MOUs with the Ministries of Education, Primary Industries, Justice, Department of Corrections, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, Police and most recently the Department of Internal Affairs.

“Improving decision making and land management practices across the public sector will ensure long-term sustainable outcomes and value for money for the Crown, and enable agencies to focus on delivering what they do best.

“The Crown Land Centre of Expertise is contributing to the Government’s Better Public Services agenda of achieving efficiencies across the state sector,” Mr Williamson says.
