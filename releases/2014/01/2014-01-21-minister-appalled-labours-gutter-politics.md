Police Minister Anne Tolley says she is appalled that Labour is trying to score cheap political points following last week’s tragic events in Dunedin.

“Labour has made wholly inaccurate and false claims around the pursuit and prosecution of cases,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I am disgusted that they would stoop so low, and try to use this terrible tragedy for political ends.

“Police twice arrested the offender responsible for this shocking crime.

“The full facts are still to emerge, and a Police investigation is continuing.”
