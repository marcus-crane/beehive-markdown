Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse says drivers in New Zealand need to continue to take on board road safety messages and take responsibility on the roads so that more people arrive at their destinations safely, after a higher Christmas holiday period road toll than last year.

Seven people died on the roads as a result of seven fatal crashes during the official holiday period which ran from 4pm on 24 December to 6am this morning. This is one more death than the same period last year which was the lowest road toll for this time since 1956/57.

The provisional holiday toll included: one driver, four passengers and two motorcycle riders. There have also been a number crashes resulting in serious injuries however, Injury statistics for the 2013/14 holiday period will take several months to finalise.

“While there was one more death on the road than last year, this is still the second lowest Christmas holiday road toll on record since 1956/57 and remains a significant decrease historically,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“However, it is important to remember that the road toll is not simply a number, and my thoughts are with all the families around New Zealand who were not able to celebrate the holiday season with their loved ones because of crashes on our roads.

“The number of people on the roads remains high throughout January so it is important for drivers to work with Police to help ensure everyone on the road has a safe journey.

“I encourage drivers to continue to take responsibility and ensure when they are travelling over summer, they stay within the speed limit, drive to the road conditions, and watch following distances.”

Road safety is a focus all year around, and the lowest road toll in 60 years for 2013 shows that the safe system approach adopted under the government’s *Safer Journeys strategy* is having a positive impact.

“If we all take care on the road, even more New Zealanders will survive the summer and we can continue the downward road toll for 2014.”
