Commerce Minister Craig Foss today announced the appointment of Sarah Bacon to the Copyright Tribunal for a term of three years.

“Mrs Bacon has a solid background in intellectual property and has extensive experience in court and tribunal proceedings,” says Mr Foss.

Mrs Bacon will join Professor Susy Frankel (Chairperson), Paul Sumpter, Peter Dengate-Thrush, Jane Glover and Warwick Smith as the current Tribunal members.

**Background:**

Mrs Bacon, a consultant at Izard Weston, is a litigation lawyer with particular expertise in media law, public law and intellectual property. She is also a trustee of the 2020 Communications Trust.

The Copyright Tribunal is a statutory body and hears disputes between licensing bodies, or proposed licensing bodies, and those who hold or seek licenses in respect of works of copyright.
