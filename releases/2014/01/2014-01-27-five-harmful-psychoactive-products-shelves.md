Associate Health Minister Todd McClay has welcomed the decision by the Psychoactive Substances Regulatory Authority to withdraw five psychoactive products from the market.

The five products are ‘AK47’, ‘Anarchy’, ‘Karma’, ‘Northern Lights Primo’ and ‘Voodoo’. The withdrawal of these products comes following evidence of harm gathered from the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring and the National Poisons Centre.

The ban is effective immediately.

“These withdrawals underscore the effectiveness of the Psychoactive Substances Act in getting harmful products off the shelves,” said Mr McClay.

“During the interim licensing period the Authority has continued to show it has teeth and is able to act decisively when products are shown to be harmful.”

“Before the Act came into force some 200-300 ‘legal high’ products were sold from an estimated 3,000-4,000 outlets nationwide. There are now only 41 products sold from less than 170 outlets.

It is illegal to sell or give approved products to anyone under the age of 18.”

“I am also pleased with the appointment of 23 Enforcement Officers who will specialise in monitoring and enforcing adherence to the Act.”

“I am satisfied that one of my last acts as Associate Health Minister is to see the removal of yet another suite of products that would have risked the health of young New Zealanders. While I acknowledge the need for the harm minimisation approach of the Act, I am no fan of these products and therefore am delighted to see five more taken off the shelves,” said Mr McClay.
