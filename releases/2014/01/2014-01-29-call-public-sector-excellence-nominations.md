State Services Minister Jonathan Coleman says it is important to recognise success in the public sector through the 2014 Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ) Gen-i Public Sector Excellence Awards. 

“I encourage all Government agencies to nominate themselves for the IPANZ Awards for projects or initiatives which have achieved great results,” says Dr Coleman.

“We need to recognise the innovations and excellent work that our public servants are delivering. Agencies are continuing to work more effectively to deliver better value and better results for New Zealanders.

“The IPANZ Awards provide a great opportunity to celebrate and reward our public servants. There are many success stories in the public sector that need to be recognised and shared more widely.

“The Awards promote excellence in vision, innovation, and achievement of results. They are also a useful way to highlight good examples of best practice which other agencies can learn from.”

Nominations are now open and close on 3 March 2014. The Awards will be held on 2 July 2014 at the TSB Arena, Wellington. There are eight categories including a new category for 2014, Excellence in Regulatory Systems.

One of the category winners is awarded the Prime Minister’s Award for Public Sector Excellence. Last year, this was awarded to the Ministry of Social Development’s communications campaign, ‘It’s OK to Help’, where good research and community ownership were key to the success of the anti-family violence campaign.
