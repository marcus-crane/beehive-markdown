Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has today welcomed further data from the Health Quality & Safety Commission (HQSC) which tracks individual DHBs’ progress in reducing patient harm.

“Patient safety and quality care are priorities for this Government. That is why last year we introduced quality and safety markers in the areas of falls, healthcare associated infections and surgery,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The HQSC selected these areas because there are known interventions which can reduce patient harm, and ultimately make our hospitals safer.

“Under the banner of the *Open for better care* campaign the HQSC has been collecting data measuring DHBs progress against these markers.

“The *Open* campaign is a mature and honest approach to healthcare, which encourages health professionals to acknowledge, report and learn from hospital incidents where harm has occurred.

“Data already published by the HQSC shows our hospitals are increasingly doing the right things to avoid harm to patients.

“A further analysis of this data has been released today. It is broken down by DHB so they can better monitor their progress over time, and identify areas that need greater focus.

“This data highlights an apparent increase in infection following surgery, known as post-operative sepsis. The findings should act as a prompt for DHBs to ensure accurate and consistent reporting, and to use available evidence of ways to address post-operative sepsis,” says Mrs Goodhew.
