Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says construction and development scheduled across 2014 will ensure a high level of confidence in the Christchurch rebuild.

“The Justice and Emergency Services Precinct is one of the first cabs off the rank and today’s sod-turning is yet another milestone achievement.

“In fact of the 16 Anchor Projects, nine will start construction in some form this year,” Mr Brownlee says.

Those nine projects are:

- The Bus Interchange
- Justice and Emergency Services Precinct
- Retail Precinct
- Health Precinct
- South Frame public realm
- Performing Arts Precinct
- North Frame and Margaret Mahy Amazing Place
- Innovation Precinct
- Metro Sports Facility

Proposals from prospective operators and design and development consortia for the Convention Centre Precinct are due back to the Central Christchurch Development Unit (CCDU) team in March for evaluation.

“Roughly three-quarters of the land required for the Convention Centre Precinct has now been purchased by the Crown and the intention is to have that area cleared by August. 

“I am confident the project remains on track to open in early 2017,” Mr Brownlee says.

Works on the Bus Interchange are well advanced with demolition progressing well.  Detailed design plans are being developed and early construction works are expected to start by the second quarter of the year.  The end result will be a transport hub complete with accommodation and hospitality options.

Mr Brownlee says there have also been exciting developments with the Retail Precinct, following CCDU’s appointment of a consortium led by Athfield Architects to produce a Retail Precinct Plan.

“Good progress has been made to ensure the public areas of the Retail Precinct are complimentary to its private projects,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Avon River Precinct progresses further this month with the start of in-river works that will see gravel washing and silt removal carried out as a way of re-generating the river’s health. 

And the North and East Frames took a big leap forward this month too, with the grassing of five large sites in the CBD. 

“This is interim work to ensure we make the most of the Crown-owned space as the next stage of frames gets underway,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Having the defined green areas will really give people a visual understanding of what the end result will be.

“In a few years’ time these spaces will be interspersed with housing for up to 2000 people, so it will have a feel of an urban park with the Amazing Place playground just a stone’s throw away. 

“It will be an exciting place to live, work and play,” Mr Brownlee says.
