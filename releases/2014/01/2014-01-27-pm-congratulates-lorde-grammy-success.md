Prime Minister John Key has congratulated Lorde and Joel Little on their success at the Grammy Awards today.

Auckland singer/songwriter Ella Yelich-O’Connor, who performs as Lorde, won the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance, and together with co-producer Joel Little won Song of the Year for Royals.

“This Grammy success underlines a fantastic year for Lorde and Joel Little. They have achieved something no other New Zealander has,’’ says Mr Key.

“Lorde is a phenomenal talent and an inspiration to all young New Zealanders. At just 17 years-old she has a great future. Her success today has made us all very proud,” says Mr Key.
