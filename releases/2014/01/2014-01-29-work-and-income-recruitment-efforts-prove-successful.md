Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is hailing the results of a recent recruitment partnership in mid-Canterbury.

Several new jobs were created when The Terrace View Retirement Village in Ashburton opened in November last year, and after the employer got in touch with Work and Income, a number of beneficiaries were referred for the job openings.

“Work and Income were successful in getting 11 clients into work with the company, several of whom had never actually worked before and only one of whom had previous caregiving experience,” Mrs Bennett said.

“They also received further assistance through Flexi-Wage work subsidies, which encourage employers to hire and train beneficiaries.”

“Work and Income are more than ready to work with people with no job history or with patchy work experience – it’s what they’re trained for and it’s why we have invested so heavily to give Case Managers the tools they need to help every person who walks through their doors.”

The new employees have also been given the opportunity to complete an NZQA caregiving course, and continue to receive strong support from rest home management.

“This is a great outcome for these clients and their families, and just one example from the many emerging from around the country as our economy gets back on track.”

Over 1,500 people are leaving the benefit for work each week and becoming financially independent as result.

“This means more choice about how their income is spent and more opportunities to save and plan for the future,” Mrs Bennett said.

“As a sole parent my first job was at an Auckland rest home, and I wouldn’t take back that experience for anything.”

“It’s tough and demanding work, but I gained important skills I still use today, just as I’m sure the people now in work thanks to this opportunity will also.”
