US Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus will hold a number of meetings in Wellington on Monday as part of a wider visit to the region.

Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman says it is a good opportunity to discuss upcoming defence exercises and other engagement activities. Secretary Mabus and Dr Coleman last met in Washington last October.

“Our defence relationship with the US is in good shape. Following the signing of the Washington Declaration in 2012, we have steadily increased the level of joint activities and enhanced co-operation in the region,” says Dr Coleman.

“Our Navies continue to work together in areas of common interest. For example, HMNZS Te Mana is currently working with the US Navy and other nations on counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.

“Looking ahead, the NZ Defence Force will be participating in Exercise RIMPAC which is held in Hawaii later this year, and Exercise Pacific Partnership, the annual humanitarian assistance mission in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Secretary Mabus’ programme includes a call on Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully, and meetings with senior Defence officials. Secretary Mabus previously visited New Zealand in 2010.
