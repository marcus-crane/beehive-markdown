New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today signed a partnership agreement that will see the two governments cooperate on renewable energy projects, primarily in the Pacific, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says.

The partnership has grown from UAE participation in the Pacific Energy Summit, held in Auckland last year.

The agreement, signed during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, will see the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) cooperate on a range of renewable energy projects across the Pacific as part of the $635 million in projects supported at the Summit.

“New Zealand is a strong supporter of renewable energy projects in the Pacific, with $65 million committed during the Summit. The UAE also has a US$50 million UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund available for similar projects.

“It is important that we work together to make the most of this funding,” Mr McCully says.
