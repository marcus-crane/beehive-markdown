Education Minister Hekia Parata says the wider education profession will play a key role in further developing details of the $359m education investment initiative announced by the Prime Minister yesterday.

“The initiative, which proposes to introduce four new roles in our schools, will further help to recognise highly-capable teachers and principals, keep good teachers in the classroom, and share expertise across schools,” Ms Parata says.

“To ensure that we get the best design detail for the initiative, I have tasked Secretary for Education, Peter Hughes, with setting up a working group.”

The working group will be made up of education sector representatives, including unions.  

The following sector representatives have been invited to be a part of the sector working group:

- Lorraine Kerr, President, New Zealand School Trustees’ Association
- Nancy Bell, Chief Executive, Te Tari Puna Ora o Aotearoa and member, EDUCANZ Transition Board
- Judith Nowotarski, National President, New Zealand Educational Institute
- Angela Roberts, President, Post Primary Teachers’ Association
- Philip Harding, President, New Zealand Principals’ Federation
- Tom Parsons, President, Secondary Principals’ Association of New Zealand
- John Garner, President, New Zealand Area Schools’ Association
- Toni Waho, Tiamana, Te  Rūnanga Nui ō ngā Kura Kaupapa Māori ō Aotearoa
- Arihia Stirling, Ngā Kura a Iwi o Aotearoa and member, EDUCANZ Transition Board
- Ross Tyson, President, New Zealand Association of Intermediate and Middle Schooling
- Unasa Enosa Auva’a, President, Pasifika Principals Association

“This initiative draws on what the profession has said it needs, what the best performing countries are doing, and what international research and evidence shows works.

“The Government has a clear plan to raise achievement across the board, which aims for five out of five students to get the qualifications they need to reach their potential.

“This new initiative will be instrumental in ensuring we have the best quality teaching in all our classrooms to help achieve that goal,” says Ms Parata.
