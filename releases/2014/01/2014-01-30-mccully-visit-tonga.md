Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will visit Tonga for two days this week.

Mr McCully will hold bilateral discussions with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Lord Tu’ivakano, as well as other cabinet ministers.

“This is a timely visit in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Ian. New Zealand is committed to supporting the Tongan Government as the recovery and reconstruction effort continues,” Mr McCully says.

“This visit is also an opportunity to discuss further development work and engage with the local business community.”
