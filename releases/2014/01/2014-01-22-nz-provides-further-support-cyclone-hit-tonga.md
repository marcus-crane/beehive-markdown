Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand is providing a further $1.4 million to help Tonga recover from Tropical Cyclone Ian.

“Following a request from the Tongan Government, New Zealand will provide equipment and materials to help restore the electricity network on the affected islands of Ha’apai. We have also made an offer to provide New Zealand-based technicians, if needed,” Mr McCully says.

“The cyclone has caused significant damage to electricity infrastructure, including power lines and transformers. Our contribution will cover resources needed to reconnect villages including those on small outer islands.

“Reliable access to electricity helps communities recover quickly after a disaster as it supports the operation of critical infrastructure such as schools, medical centres and businesses.

“New Zealand is committed to supporting the Tongan Government as the relief and reconstruction effort continues.”

Today’s announcement brings New Zealand’s support for the cyclone response to $1.9 million.
