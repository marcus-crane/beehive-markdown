The ballot for attendance passes to the 100th anniversary commemorations of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli closes at midnight this Friday, 31 January.

“I strongly encourage those interested in attending commemorations at Gallipoli in 2015 to take this final opportunity to enter the ballot,” says Veterans’ Affairs Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“As expected, interest in attending the 2015 commemorations has been high. Nearly 8000 New Zealanders have now entered the ballot for a double pass since it opened in mid-November.”

Entering the ballot for attendance passes is the only way to attend the 2015 Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli.

Online applications will be accepted until midnight Friday 31 January. Mailed applications must be postmarked 31 January to be eligible in the ballot.

The ballot will be drawn in late February. Those unsuccessful in the direct descendant and veteran categories will automatically be entered into the general category of the ballot. Applicants will be advised whether they have been successful by 31 March 2014.

“While attendance passes are free, those New Zealanders who are successful in the ballot will need to make their own travel arrangements and meet all their own costs,” says Mr Woodhouse.
