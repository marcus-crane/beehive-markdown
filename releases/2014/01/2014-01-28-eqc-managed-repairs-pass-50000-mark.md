Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission Gerry Brownlee says contractors working with EQC have now repaired around two-thirds of the damaged homes EQC is responsible for in greater Christchurch, having this week passed the 50,000 repairs mark.

“To date EQC’s project managed repair programme has completed 50,174 earthquake repairs below the $100,000 per-event cap, so the end of the scheme is very much in sight,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Canterbury Home Repair Programme (CHRP) began in October 2010 following the award of a management contract to Fletcher EQR in a competitive tender.

“The government established the managed home repair programme to coordinate the delivery of repairs that would maintain the quality of the Canterbury housing stock, manage wage and material inflation, retain the workforce and support confidence in the region’s long term future,” Mr Brownlee says.

“As well as substantive repairs, the CHRP has overseen more than 47,000 emergency repairs, along with the installation of nearly 19,000 home heating units.

“Around 1800 full home repairs are being completed each month with more than 500 local contracting firms completing about 90 repairs a day.”

Mr Brownlee says a major risk for Christchurch given the extent of residential damage was that confidence in the region’s housing stock would fall in the wake of the earthquakes.

“The Canterbury Home Repair Programme has ensured this has not happened.  On the contrary, we’ve instilled confidence and Christchurch house values are being maintained.”

Mr Brownlee says Canterbury’s economic growth delivers its own set of challenges, but things could have been much worse had the government not placed responsible limits around the repair of EQC customers’ homes.

“Cost inflation for materials and building work would likely have run rampant, poor workmanship would have been commonplace and overall confidence in the recovery would have suffered as a result,” Mr Brownlee says.

The Earthquake Commission aims to complete all repairs by 31 December 2014.
