Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows says students who have yet to apply for their 2014 Student Loan or Allowance now risk not getting their payments sorted by their study start date.

Mr Borrows says StudyLink has worked hard to make sure students are aware of the consequences of leaving things to the last minute.

“StudyLink advised students to apply by 16 December. It sent 570,000 emails as well as text messages, material on campus, used Twitter and Facebook, and got help from education providers and student associations to get the message out there,” says Mr Borrows.

“Over 90,000 students responded to that message, a 46 per cent increase on the same time last year, which is great news. These applications will be given priority.”

“But as at mid-January there’s more than 60,000 students yet to apply. It’s important that students understand that StudyLink is now entering its busiest time.”

Mr Borrows says that with such large volumes to process it can take 8 weeks or more to finalise an application, particularly for complex applications requiring additional information such as parent’s income.

“With NCEA results released last week there is no need to delay applying.  Even students waiting on limited entry courses can start the application process now before they finalise their courses for the year,” says Mr Borrows. 

“My message to students is simple. StudyLink is there to help you, and the sooner you get your application in, the sooner they can do that.

“Every day students delay only makes it harder for StudyLink to get them their right entitlement on day one.”

Students can find out more about the application process on the StudyLink website ([www.studylink.govt.nz](http://www.studylink.govt.nz)) and can also track the progress of their application online using their MyStudyLink account.
