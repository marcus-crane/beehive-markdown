Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand is providing further assistance to Tonga in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Ian.

“Following a request from the Tonga Government, New Zealand will supply 300 emergency shelter kits, which can provide interim shelter to over 2000 people, and assist the New Zealand and Tongan Red Cross with the provision of clean water on the islands of Ha’apai,” Mr McCully says.

“We will also make a further $300,000 available to New Zealand non-government organisations working with partners on the ground.

“Cyclone Ian has resulted in the loss of one life and caused significant damage to buildings and some infrastructure. New Zealand continues to work closely with Tongan authorities and will consider all further requests for assistance.”

The relief supplies will be delivered to Tonga by New Zealand Defence Force C-130 this afternoon.

Today’s announcement brings New Zealand’s support to Tonga since Tropical Cyclone Ian struck last week to $500,000.
