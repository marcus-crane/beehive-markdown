Finance Minister Bill English will deliver Budget 2014 on Thursday, 15 May, he announced today.

“This will be the National-led Government’s sixth Budget and it will remain focused on delivering sensible policies that support a more competitive and faster-growing economy, more jobs, higher incomes and opportunities for New Zealand families,” he says.

“The Government’s programme is delivering results, but achieving our potential will require consistent and positive change for several years to come.

“New Zealand is certainly well placed compared to most countries. On average, wages are increasing faster than inflation, there are more than 53,000 more people employed now than a year ago and the unemployment rate is dropping as the economy gathers strength.

“The Government remains on track to surplus next year and we will then have choices that we simply don’t have while we are running deficits.

“So Budget 2014 will be about building on that success and ensuring the benefits of a stronger economy are locked in for New Zealanders and their families.”
