Youth Affairs Minister Nikki Kaye joined Prime Minister John Key at a dinner last night to celebrate young participants of the 2014 Prime Minister’s Youth Programme.

The annual programme, which is now in its fifth year, involves up to 100 young people aged 14 - 17 years in Auckland. They have been recognised for facing and managing challenges and taking positive steps in their lives, such as improving their academic performance, or moving away from behaviour like truancy and low-level offending.

The programme aims to provide young people with opportunities, skills and experiences that will be valuable to them in their everyday lives.

They spend the week taking part in various fun and educational activities facilitated by different providers around Auckland, Wellington and Rotorua. These include leadership tasks at the Hobsonville Defence Base, a design workshop with Saatchi & Saatchi, as well as career workshops hosted by Coca Cola and Vodafone.

“These young people all faced challenges in their lives and I am impressed of the way they have managed. They have had to make some tough decisions in their lives and are all taking steps towards a better life,” said Ms Kaye.

“The dinner and awards ceremony gave participants the opportunity to celebrate their achievements, alongside supporters of the programme and others who have spent time with them throughout the week.”

“This programme has given participants the chance to learn new things and meet others who have also faced obstacles and made positive changes. I’m sure they will take useful skills and experiences back to their communities,” said Ms Kaye.
