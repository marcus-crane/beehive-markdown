The African Union (AU) Commission and the New Zealand Government have collaborated to produce a comprehensive guide to the African Union system.

The first edition of African Union Handbook 2014 was launched in the margins of the African Union Executive Council at the AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa on Monday by Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and AU Commissioner for Human Resources Science and Technology Dr Martial De-Paul Ikounga.

The African Union Handbook 2014 is a ready reference guide for people working in all parts of the AU system as well as the AU’s many partners and wider civil society. It has been modelled on the United Nations Handbook, a publication that has been produced by the New Zealand Government for over 50 years.

“Today, the AU is central to the advancement of Africa. It is the pre-eminent organisation of the continent. This African Union Handbook 2014 will be a valuable guide to our member states, citizens and partners as they navigate the AU system,” Dr Ikounga says.

“As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and African Union, and as we engage in the process of conceiving Agenda 2063, it is timely for the AU system to have this guide.

“The handbook contains detailed and factual information about the AU and summary information relating to its predecessor, the OAU, which was formed in 1963. It illustrates some of the work that has gone into building African unity, prosperity and peace through the AU, the solid achievements of pan-Africanism and pathways to the future.”

Mr McCully says New Zealand is proud to contribute to the 50th anniversary celebrations and collaborate with the Commission to produce the prototype AU Handbook.

“Given New Zealand’s expertise in developing the UN Handbook, it made sense to work together on this publication. New Zealand is also committed to future work with AU member states and the Commission in areas of common interest, such as agriculture and food security,” Mr McCully says.
