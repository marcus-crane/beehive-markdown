Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today announced the latest injection of funding to build muscle in the social sector.

The Capability Investment Resource (CIR) provides $31.65 million over four years to strengthen Ministry of Social Development-funded organisations.

“We’ve provided funding so they can work independently or with specialist mentors, to build a plan that will develop and strengthen their organisations.”

“Community organisations are so busy delivering services, it can be hard to step back and assess what changes are needed to improve.”

“In the second distribution round of the CIR, a funding injection has gone to 176 non-government organisations around New Zealand,” said Mrs Bennett.

Of those, 151 organisations received a total of just over $1 million to work with capability mentors who’ll help them review their organisation and make a plan.

Another 25 organisations have received $1.36 million to allow them to implement the capability development plans they have worked up.

“Putting these plans into practise is the next step and means organisations can really grow and improve their ability to support New Zealanders in need.”

“Just as this Government strives to actively make a difference, then step back, assess progress and make adjustments to move ahead; community organisations need the resources to ensure they’re on track.”

In the first year of the CIR we invested over $8.6 million in more than 280 organisations to work with capability mentors to review and plan for their own capability development, or to put capability development plans into action. 

The feedback from organisations that have received capability funding has been very positive.

One organisation said, “we often don’t take the time to step back and take a big picture view of what’s happening in the organisation. Having an independent facilitator lead us through that process has been invaluable.”

By the middle of 2014 the Government will have committed around $23 million in capability development funding into the social sector through the CIR.
