Young New Zealanders will from next month be able to spend a year working, studying and holidaying in the Philippines, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today.

A new working holiday scheme will allow 100 New Zealanders to holiday and work in the Philippines and 100 Filipinos to do the same in New Zealand each year.

Mr McCully says the scheme, open to people aged 18-30, is an excellent opportunity for young New Zealanders to experience another culture.

“The Filipino community, at over 37,000 strong, is now the largest of all ASEAN communities in New Zealand.

“This working holiday scheme will further promote the important links between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.

Applications for the scheme open 5 February.
